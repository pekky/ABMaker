The crowd roared as we took our seats; the Long\nMarchers applauded. The Hospitality Girls served us tea. I kept my head\ndown and tried to hide my bare legs beneath the table. The cadres gave their\nspeeches, praising the Long Marchers and reminding the crowd of the great\nhistory that was being honored. The speeches were delivered forcefully, like\nold films of dictators, and none of the speakers was better than Vice President\nDou. He was a tiny man in his fifties who weighed perhaps 115 pounds, and\nthere was a sparrowlike quality to his thin chest and delicate light-boned\narms. But he worked the microphone brilliantly—at first softly, calmly, like a\nlecturer talking to a group of children; now louder, slowly quickening the\ngestures, a slender hand waving out over the crowd, almost as if scolding\nthem; and finally he was shouting, arms pumping, eyes flashing,"

It was inevitable that such a past would have some effect on the\nway locals viewed us, but we knew nothing about this chapter in history.\nProbably it would have been harder if we had known more. One of my\nfavorite students was a girl named Anne, whose family lived on the ground\nfloor of our building. Her father was a math professor, the highest-ranking\nfaculty member on campus, and this was an honor that had earned him a\nplace in our exclusive building. It had also earned him a job in a remote\nSichuan coal mine for eight years of the Cultural Revolution. Like so many\nother talented Chinese, he had been banished as an intellectual, or chou\nlaojiu, “the Old Stinking Ninth”, the lowest of the low, the ones who could be\nsaved only by the basest and most tedious labor.\nThose years seemed to sit lightly on Professor Liang—he was a cheerful\nman, undoubtedly happy to have been politically rehabilitated. Even in the\ncoal mine he had made the best of the situation, winning the locals’\nadmiration by showing them how to balance their accounts. But I thought that\nperhaps the past had somehow affected his daughter more, even though she\nhad not lived through his experience. She was one of the brightest students in\nthe class, and also one of the few who stood apart. Her ideas were different—\nshe liked being alone, and she made up her own mind; she was capable of\nveering away from the political cant that most of them rehashed. Of all my\nstudents, I expected her to be the most open-minded to me as a foreigner.\nAnd yet after her graduation she wrote a letter and explained honestly how it\nhad been at the beginning:\nNot long after you became my teacher, I read a piece of old news\ncomment that said Mr. Clinton took presidency, one of the reasons [why\nthe Americans had elected him] was that he would take stronger\nmeasure on China. Those days, I hated to see you and Mr. Meier.\nIn the first few months I never would have guessed that such feelings\nwere so strong, although there were occasional signs that my students still\nviewed the outside world with mistrust.

It was inevitable that such a past would have some effect on the\nway locals viewed us, but we knew nothing about this chapter in history.\nProbably it would have been harder if we had known more. One of my\nfavorite students was a girl named Anne, whose family lived on the ground\nfloor of our building. Her father was a math professor, the highest-ranking\nfaculty member on campus, and this was an honor that had earned him a\nplace in our exclusive building. It had also earned him a job in a remote\nSichuan coal mine for eight years of the Cultural Revolution. Like so many\nother talented Chinese, he had been banished as an intellectual, or chou\nlaojiu, “the Old Stinking Ninth”, the lowest of the low, the ones who could be\nsaved only by the basest and most tedious labor.\nThose years seemed to sit lightly on Professor Liang—he was a cheerful\nman, undoubtedly happy to have been politically rehabilitated. Even in the\ncoal mine he had made the best of the situation, winning the locals’\nadmiration by showing them how to balance their accounts. But I thought that\nperhaps the past had somehow affected his daughter more, even though she\nhad not lived through his experience. She was one of the brightest students in\nthe class, and also one of the few who stood apart. Her ideas were different—\nshe liked being alone, and she made up her own mind; she was capable of\nveering away from the political cant that most of them rehashed. Of all my\nstudents, I expected her to be the most open-minded to me as a foreigner.\nAnd yet after her graduation she wrote a letter and explained honestly how it\nhad been at the beginning:\nNot long after you became my teacher, I read a piece of old news\ncomment that said Mr. Clinton took presidency, one of the reasons [why\nthe Americans had elected him] was that he would take stronger\nmeasure on China. Those days, I hated to see you and Mr. Meier.\nIn the first few months I never would have guessed that such feelings\nwere so strong, although there were occasional signs that my students still\nviewed the outside world with mistrust. I treated these moments as isolated\nincidents—I responded, usually gently, and then I tried to think no more"

And\nso the long stone staircases are the true boulevards of Fuling, carrying most\nof its traffic—shoppers descending the stairs, pausing to browse in stores;\nporters climbing up, shoulders bowed under the weight of crates and bundles.\nVirtually every necessary good or service can be found along these\nstairways and their landings. There are shops and restaurants, cobblers and\nbarbers. One of the lower stairways is lined with Daoist fortune-tellers.\nAnother staircase is home to a group of three dentists who work at a table\ncovered with rusty tools, syringes in mysterious fluids, and pans of cruelly\ndefeated teeth—a sort of crude advertisement. Sometimes a peasant will stop\nto have his tooth pulled, after haggling over the price, and a crowd will gather\nto watch. Everything is public. A haircut comes with an audience. The price\nof any purchase is commented on by the other shoppers who pause as they\npass. For medical problems one can sit in the open air and see a traditional\nChinese physician, who has a regular stand near the top of one of the\nstairways. His stand consists of a stool, a box of bottles, and a white sheet\nwith big characters that say:"

But then something clears the valleys\n—a shift in temperature, a stiff breeze—and suddenly the view opens.\nSouthward the mountain falls away steeply to valleys of terraced\ncropland, and near the Wu River the land is broken by the settlements of the\nEast River district: the college, looking small with the distance; the ceramics\nfactory, its stacks spewing yellow dust into the air; the long concrete pier and\nthe old ferries that traverse the Wu. The river lies slack, like a long thin bolt\nof gray silk unrolled between the hills.\nIn the mist the city looks dirty and old, its buildings flung carelessly\nacross the hills, and it also looks big.

And he\ndoesn’t understand basketball.”\n“Budui! Here you can’t dribble the same way that you do in America,\nbecause they have different rules in the NBA. That’s the problem—you’re\naccustomed to playing the American way.”\nShe said it in hopes of ending the argument tactfully, because she saw\nthat I was annoyed. But I had already heard too many explanations about “the\nChinese way,” and I did not want to be lectured about Basketball with\nChinese Characteristics.\n“Basketball is an American sport,” I said. “We made the rules and I\nunderstand them. That referee just doesn’t like waiguoren.” After I spoke, I\nrealized how stupid my words sounded, and I might as well have continued:\nAnd we Americans can study a language for only four months and already\nconvey our arrogance. But I didn’t have the vocabulary for that, and in any\ncase it was clear that both of us wanted to talk about something else.

Teacher Sai and\nDean Fu were there to translate.\n“This is Mr. Wang from the Chinese department,” Teacher Sai said. “Mr.\nWang came to the college in 1977—he was part of the first class when the\ncollege opened after the Great Cultural Revolution. He was the best English\nstudent, but English was not a preferred subject in those days. So he became\na Chinese professor instead. But he is still very interested in English.”\nAdam and I shook Teacher Wang’s hand again. Teacher Sai seemed to\nhave forgotten the other man, who didn’t appear to be offended. Obviously\nhe was accustomed to moving in the bigger man’s wake.\nAll of us sat down. Adam and I waited for the request; cynically I\nassumed that Teacher Wang wanted English lessons. Already I could imagine"

        "AUTHOR’S NOTE\nTHE CHAPTERS OF THIS BOOK describe my life in Fuling, while the\ninterspersed sketches focus on the local landscape, its history, and the people.\nAll of these sketches were written while I still lived there, and I’ve used this\nstructure to give the reader some sense of the two roles that a foreigner plays\nin a town like Fuling. Sometimes I was an observer, while at other moments I\nwas very much involved in local life, and this combination of distance and\nintimacy was part of what shaped my two years in Sichuan.\nA few of the characters’ names and other identifying features have been\nchanged in cases where the subject matter is sensitive. I’ve relied on the\nstandard pinyin romanization for most of the Chinese names and words, with\nexceptions for a few well-known names such as Yangtze and Hong Kong.\nThis isn’t a book about China. It’s about a certain small part of China at a\ncertain brief period in time, and my hope has been to capture the richness of\nboth the moment and the place. The place I know well—the murky Yangtze,\nthe green well-worked mountains—but the moment is more difficult to\ndefine. Fuling was situated midriver both geographically and historically, and\nsometimes it was hard to see where things came from and where they were\ngoing. But the town and its people were always full of life and energy and\nhope, which in the end is my subject. Rather than an inquiry into a source or\na destination, this is an account of what it was like to spend two years in the\nheart of the great river’s current.",
        "CHAPTER ONE",
        "Downstream\nI CAME TO FULING on the slow boat downstream from Chongqing. It\nwas a warm, clear night at the end of August in 1996—stars flickering above\nthe Yangtze River, their light too faint to reflect off the black water. A car\nfrom the college drove us along the narrow streets that twisted up from the\ndocks. The city rushed past, dim and strange under the stars.\nThere were two of us. We had been sent to work as teachers, and both of\nus were young: I was twenty-seven and Adam Meier was twenty-two. We\nhad heard almost nothing about Fuling. I knew that part of the city would be\nflooded by the new Three Gorges Dam, and I knew that for many years\nFuling had been closed to outsiders. Other than that I had been told very\nlittle.\nNo Americans had lived there for half a century. Later, I would meet\nolder people in town who remembered some American residents in the\n1940s, before the 1949 Communist Liberation, but such memories were\nalways vague. When we arrived, there was one other foreigner, a German\nwho was spending a semester teaching at a local high school. But we met him\nonly once, and he left not long after we settled in. After that we were the only\nforeigners in town. The population was about 200,000, which made it a small\ncity by Chinese standards.\nThere was no railroad in Fuling. It had always been a poor part of\nSichuan province and the roads were bad. To go anywhere you took the boat,\nbut mostly you didn’t go anywhere. For the next two years the city was my\nhome.\nA WEEK AFTER WE ARRIVED, everybody in the college gathered at the\nfront gate. A group of students and teachers had spent the summer walking\nfrom Fuling to Yan’an, the former revolutionary base in northern Shaanxi",
        "province, and now they were returning to school.\nIt was the sixtieth anniversary of the Long March, the six-thousand-mile\ntrek that the Red Army had made during the most critical part of the civil\nwar, when the Kuomintang was on the verge of destroying Mao Zedong’s\nforces. Against all odds the Communists had marched to safety, over the\nmountains and deserts of western China, and from Yan’an they had steadily\nbuilt their strength until at last their revolution carried the nation, driving the\nKuomintang to Taiwan.\nAll semester there were special events in the college to commemorate the\nanniversary of the march. The students took classes on the history of the\nLong March, they wrote essays about the Long March, and in December\nthere was a Long March Singing Contest. For the Long March Singing\nContest, all of the departments practiced their songs for weeks and then\nperformed in the auditorium. Many of the songs were the same, because the\nmusical potential of the Long March is limited, which made the judging\ndifficult. It was also confusing because costumes were in short supply and so\nthey were shared, like the songs. The history department would perform,\nresplendent in clean white shirts and red ties, and then they would go offstage\nand quickly give their shirts and ties to the politics department, who would\nget dressed, rush onstage, and sing the same song that had just been sung. By\nthe end of the evening the shirts were stained with sweat and everybody in\nthe audience knew all the songs. The music department won, as they always\ndid, and English was near the back. The English department never won any\nof the college’s contests. There aren’t any English songs about the Long\nMarch.\nBut the summer walk to Yan’an was not a contest, and the return of the\nFuling group was by far the biggest event of the Long March season. They\nhad walked more than a thousand miles, all of it in the brutal heat of the\nChinese summer, and in the end only sixteen had made it. Thirteen were\nstudents, and two were teachers: the Chinese department’s Communist Party\nSecretary and the math department’s Assistant Political Adviser. There was\nalso a lower-level administrator, who had burst into tears in the middle of the\nwalk and gained a measure of local fame for his perseverance. All of the\nparticipants were men. Some of the women students had wanted to come\nalong, but the college had decided that the Long March was not for girls.\nA week before the assembly, President Li, the head of the college, had",
        "traveled to Xi’an to meet the marching students, because at the finish of the\ntrek they had run into trouble.\n“The students have some kind of problem,” said Dean Fu Muyou, the\nhead of the English department, when I asked him what had happened. “I\nthink they probably have no money left.” And it was true—they had run out\nof cash, despite their sponsorship by Magnificent Sound cigarettes, the Fuling\ntobacco company. It struck me as a particularly appropriate way to honor the\nhistory of Chinese Communism, to march a thousand miles and end up\nbankrupt in Yan’an.\nBut President Li had been able to bail them out, and now the entire\nstudent body of the college met in the plaza near the front gate. It was a small\nteachers college with an enrollment of two thousand students, and it had been\nopened in 1977, one of many that were founded after the 1966–1976 Cultural\nRevolution had destroyed much of China’s education system. On the\nspectrum of Chinese higher education, this type of teachers college was near\nthe bottom. Courses took three years and the degree was considered lower\nthan a bachelor’s, and nearly all of the students came from peasant homes in\nthe countryside of Sichuan province. After graduation they returned to their\nhometowns, where they became teachers in rural middle-schools.\nFor many of the students, especially the freshmen, the college was an\nexciting place. Campus was just across the Wu River from the main city of\nFuling, and few of the students had ever lived near a city that large. The\ncollege had movies, competitions, and dances on the weekends. Often there\nwere political rallies and assemblies like the one to welcome the Long\nMarchers, and the students buzzed with anticipation as they milled around the\nplaza.\nA group of eight women students stood at attention near the gate. They\nwore white blouses and black skirts, and across their chests were red sashes\nemblazoned with the name of the college. They were known as Hospitality\nGirls, and they had been carefully selected from the student body. All of the\nHospitality Girls were tall and beautiful, and none of them smiled. They\nrepresented the college at official functions, standing in perfect formation,\nwalking gracefully, pouring tea for dignitaries.\nThat was something else I had heard about Fuling: its women had a\nreputation for being beautiful. At least that’s what I had been told in my\nChinese class in Chengdu. One of my teachers was from Manchuria, a wisp",
        "of a woman with high cheekbones who had a gentle, skittish way of speaking.\nEven in summer she clutched a bottle of tea in both hands as if for warmth.\nHer name was Teacher Shang, and though she had never been to Fuling she\nsaid with conviction that the women there would be beautiful.\n“It’s because of the river and the mountains,” she said. “All places with\nmountains and water have beautiful women.”\nAnd in Chengdu I had met a Fuling native who told me the same thing.\n“But sometimes the people there have bad tempers,” she warned. “That’s\nbecause it’s so hot, and because they have mountains there.” I often heard\nremarks like this, and they suggested that the Chinese saw their landscapes\ndifferently than outsiders did. I looked at the terraced hills and noticed how\nthe people had changed the earth, taming it into dizzying staircases of rice\npaddies; but the Chinese looked at the people and saw how they had been\nshaped by the land. During my early days at the college I sometimes thought\nabout this, especially since nearly all of my students had grown up close to\nthe earth, and I wondered how the rugged Sichuan landscape had affected\nthem. And at the same time I wondered what it would do to me in two years.\nTHE FULING MAYOR was the first to arrive. He was chauffeured to the\ncollege gate in a black Audi, and he stepped out of the car and waved briefly\nto the students’ applause. The local TV news was there and they filmed him,\na short pudgy man puffing in the September heat. Quickly he walked across\nthe plaza and greeted Adam and me, shaking our hands and welcoming us to\nthe city.\nThat was often the first thing that happened at events we attended in\nFuling—the new Americans were greeted. On the day of the Long March\nrally we had been on our way to a hike, dressed casually in shorts and T-\nshirts, and we had stopped by out of curiosity. It was a foolish mistake to\nattend something of that sort without dressing appropriately, and we should\nhave known better, because already we were learning that it was difficult to\nwatch anything without becoming the center of attention.\nPatriotic music blared from the campus loudspeakers as the Long\nMarchers arrived. They wore white T-shirts and camouflage fatigues. They\nwere unshaven. Old canvas military packs hung from their shoulders. The",
        "leader carried a faded red banner that bore the name of the college and\nMagnificent Sound cigarettes, and he marched behind the Hospitality Girls,\nwho were divided into two rows of four, walking in step, their heads steady,\neyes straight ahead, arms swinging sharply. The rest of the Long Marchers\nfollowed in single file, smiling proudly and waving to the crowd. Everybody\napplauded, and the audience followed the procession into the auditorium,\nwhere a banner proclaimed:\nWarmly Welcome the Fuling Teachers College Magnificent Sound\nCigarette Ten-Thousand-Mile Long March Team as They Return from\nVictory!\nAdam and I ducked into seats at the back of the auditorium, hoping to\navoid attention. The students around us murmured and turned to stare. The\nattention spread, and soon everybody in the auditorium was craning their\nnecks to see us—sinking in our chairs, baseball hats pulled low over our\nfaces—and in a moment Vice President Dou was leading us onto the stage.\nReally he had no choice; otherwise the audience’s attention would have been\ndivided. This was one reason why we were so often incorporated into local\nevents: it was a simple way to make sure people watched.\nWe were seated alongside the mayor and the Communist Party Secretary\nand the other cadres. The crowd roared as we took our seats; the Long\nMarchers applauded. The Hospitality Girls served us tea. I kept my head\ndown and tried to hide my bare legs beneath the table. The cadres gave their\nspeeches, praising the Long Marchers and reminding the crowd of the great\nhistory that was being honored. The speeches were delivered forcefully, like\nold films of dictators, and none of the speakers was better than Vice President\nDou. He was a tiny man in his fifties who weighed perhaps 115 pounds, and\nthere was a sparrowlike quality to his thin chest and delicate light-boned\narms. But he worked the microphone brilliantly—at first softly, calmly, like a\nlecturer talking to a group of children; now louder, slowly quickening the\ngestures, a slender hand waving out over the crowd, almost as if scolding\nthem; and finally he was shouting, arms pumping, eyes flashing,",
        "loudspeakers booming, the speaker and his audience now equal, united as\ncomrades, patriots, servants of humanity; the crowd rising and erupting into\ncheers and a mad rush of applause.\nI heard him say Adam’s and my Chinese names, Mei Erkang and He Wei,\nand he announced that we had been sent to Fuling by the U.S.-China\nFriendship Volunteers, which was the Chinese term for Peace Corps. The\ncrowd roared again—all of us were comrades now, together serving the\npeople, building the country—and the Long Marchers stood proudly as each\nwas pinned on the chest by a dignitary bearing a ribbon and a red plastic\nflower. Somebody handed me a flower and a ribbon; somebody else pointed\nme toward a Long Marcher waiting at the front of the stage. He smiled,\nbowed, and shook my hand fervently. I apologized and pinned him as quickly\nas possible, hoping to minimize the limelight on my shorts, but the crowd\ncheered again and I waved, the applause rising once more. I sat down, my\nface hot.\nAfter the ceremony they took a photograph to commemorate the event. In\nthe picture, the Long Marchers and the cadres are standing proudly in three\nrows, carefully spaced, and the faded red banner is unfurled in the style of the\nold revolutionary units. The Fuling Long Marchers wear clean white T-shirts\nand red ribbons on their chests. They are not smiling. The most important\ncadres stand in the front row, along with Adam and me. Vice President Dou\nand Communist Party Secretary Wei are smiling slightly while we grin in\nembarrassment. Adam is wearing sandals and I have on an old gray T-shirt,\nand our bare legs interrupt the row of neat trousers. None of the other cadres\nis smiling. There are no women in the photograph.\nTWO YEARS LATER, after I returned to America, I would show that\npicture to friends and try to tell the story. But where to begin? To explain\nwhy the post-Cultural Revolution college was honoring the Long March was\nas difficult as telling how the mountains had been turned into terraces. Finally\nI would say: This was a political assembly at our college, and our\nparticipation was a surprise, because in most parts of the world Peace Corps\nvolunteers are not welcomed with Communist Party rallies. And I left it at\nthat—that was my story of the photograph.",
        "Of course, none of it was that simple. I was a Peace Corps volunteer but I\nwasn’t; China was Communist but it wasn’t. Nothing was quite what it\nseemed, and that was how life went in those early days, everything uncertain\nand half a step off.\nIn Chinese, Peace Corps was Heping Dui, and there was more to those\nthree simple characters than met the eye. During the Cultural Revolution,\nwhen anti-American propaganda reached a climax, the Chinese government\nhad said much about the Peace Corps—that it was in league with the CIA,\nthat it was an agent of Western imperialism, that America sent its young\npeople overseas so their idealism would influence the Third World toward\nCapitalism (the toughest job you’ll ever love). These things were no longer\nsaid, but the echoes still remained, and the word was hopelessly tainted. But\nthe Chinese language, like the people, had learned to shift with the political\nwinds, and another title was found when the Peace Corps came to China in\n1993—Meizhong Youhou Zhiyuanzhe, U.S.-China Friendship Volunteers.\nThe characters were more complicated but the connotations infinitely\nsimpler. College authorities instructed our students never to use the term\n“Peace Corps,” in English or Chinese, and most of them didn’t. And so with a\neuphemism for a job title, I came to teach at a college that was built on the\nashes of the Cultural Revolution, where history was never far away and\npolitics everywhere you looked.\nIt was the Friendship that terrified all of us at the beginning. That was the\npart of the title that was difficult to translate or interpret. The college had had\nthree foreign teachers the year before, an elderly Australian couple and a\nmiddle-aged man from Mexico, but that had been simpler because they were\nthere for less than a year and rarely strayed far from campus. We were\ndifferent—we were young, we were planning to live in Fuling for two years,\nand we had been sent by the American government as part of the third group\nof Peace Corps volunteers to come to China. The college gave us apartments\nin its best building, where the Communist Party Secretary and the other most\nimportant cadres lived, and for weeks they banqueted us almost every other\nnight. There was a protocol to these affairs. We would sit down to a table full\nof Chinese appetizers—cashews, dried beef, string beans, lotus root—and\noften Teacher Han would make an announcement. He was the interim\nrepresentative of the college waiban, or foreign affairs office, and he was\ntwenty-seven years old. He had the best spoken English in the college, but he",
        "was an uneasy young man in a new position of authority. He asked us to call\nhim Albert.\nOne evening in the first week, he turned to us before the banquet had\nbegun.\n“The college has decided,” he said, “to buy you telephones that can call\noutside the college. You will be able to call anywhere in China.”\nWe protested—it wasn’t necessary, phones were expensive, volunteers at\nother colleges didn’t have them. He waved us off. “Not a problem,” he said.\n“Otherwise it’s not convenient for you.” Adam and I looked at each other and\nshrugged. We thanked him, and everybody began to eat, and the next day\nrepairmen appeared to install our telephones.\nA few days later there was another banquet, another announcement. “The\ncollege has decided,” Albert said, “that it will buy Adam a washing\nmachine.”\n“I already have one in my apartment,” I said. “We can share that one—\nthere’s no need to waste money.”\n“It is inconvenient,” Albert said. “The college has decided.” Again our\nprotests were ignored. And so we began to eat, and the next morning a new\nwashing machine appeared at Adam’s door.\nA few days later, Adam was playing cards with some of the English\ndepartment faculty members, and Party Secretary Zhang Yan mentioned that\nthe college had received our résumés and biographical information from the\nPeace Corps.\n“I see that you play tennis,” said Party Secretary Zhang. “You must play\nvery well.”\nAdam had coached at a tennis camp during college summers, and he was\nquick to shake his head. “I don’t play that well,” he said. “It’s been a long\ntime since I played seriously.”\nParty Secretary Zhang grinned and picked up his cards. He was a thin,\nsinewy man with crewcut hair, and it had taken us a week to establish two\nfacts about him: he was the best basketball player on the English department\nfaculty, as well as the best drinker of Chinese baijiu, or grain alcohol. He was\nalso the highest-ranking cadre in the department, and as Communist Party\nSecretary he had authority over academic, disciplinary, and political issues.\nHe was the sort of man who rarely spoke, but when he did speak, things\nhappened. Now he examined his cards, leaned forward, and looked up at",
        "Adam.\n“The college,” he said softly, “has decided to buy you tennis!”\nHe sat back in his chair, waiting for the meaning of the declaration to sink\nin. But that was the problem—how exactly does one go about buying tennis?\nFor a few moments Adam tried to decide how he should respond.\n“That’s very kind of the college,” he said at last, speaking carefully. “I\nappreciate that you want to do something for us, but it isn’t necessary. You\ndon’t have to buy me tennis, Mr. Zhang.”\nParty Secretary Zhang smiled as he discarded a card.\n“Mr. Wei,” he said, “is concerned that you might want to play tennis. He\nwants to make sure that you and Pete are happy.”\nMr. Wei was the Party Secretary of the entire college, and as the highest-\nlevel Communist Party official on campus he undoubtedly had more\nimportant things to do than buy tennis for Peace Corps volunteers. Adam said\nsomething to this effect, emphasizing that he was quite happy without tennis.\nBut Party Secretary Zhang was firm.\n“It has been decided,” he said flatly. “The college will buy you tennis.\nNow it is time to play cards.”\nTHE NEXT MORNING, tennis did not appear at Adam’s doorstep, but he\ndidn’t take any chances. He told me about the conversation, and together we\nmade an attempt to communicate to the college, the sort of effort that over the\nnext two years would be made again and again, with mixed results. Often our\ncommunication was indirect, and rarely was it simple. Sometimes it resulted\nin exactly the opposite of what we wanted.\nWe talked with Albert, we talked again with Party Secretary Zhang, and\nwe talked with Dean Fu and other English department faculty members. We\nsaid that tennis was very expensive, and I didn’t know how to play it, and in\nfact Adam didn’t even like it anymore. He had outgrown it in college and if\nanything he was looking forward to having a nice long break from tennis. It\nwas a lousy game. Basketball was much better, and so was soccer. Tennis\nwas a game of the exploiting classes. Actually, we never went quite that far,\nbut we tried everything else, and for a week we campaigned steadily against\nthe buying of tennis.",
        "Next to our apartment building was a croquet court. It was without a\ndoubt the nicest spot on campus, and perhaps it was the most peaceful patch\nof earth I ever saw in China. In a crowded country there weren’t many places\nlike that—a spot where the land was used for nothing but enjoyment. A ring\nof trees shaded the borders, and the packed dirt surface was perfectly smooth.\nIt was well tended, but mostly it was smooth and beautiful because it was\nwell played. Every morning, the retired teachers and workers in the college\nmet in the croquet court, where they played all day long, with a break for\nlunch. They were impossibly good. They were so good that it almost didn’t\nseem competitive—the ball went where it was intended to go, the way a\nmagician’s cards move according to the silent harmony of routine and skill. It\nwas a daily exhibition, a game of trick shots; the retirees were artists—they\nhad taken croquet to an entirely new level. And the whole affair was almost\nthe exact same size as a tennis court.\nFor the first few weeks that was our great fear. Our balconies overlooked\nthe court, and every morning we gazed out, afraid to see workers, shovels,\npicks, backhoes, dynamite—whatever was involved in the buying of tennis,\nwe were deeply and sincerely afraid of it. The uncertainty was the worst part;\nit seemed an abstract notion, to buy tennis, but at the same time Fuling was\nclearly the sort of place where a great deal of work could be put into turning\nthe abstract into reality. A glance at the plans for the Three Gorges Dam was\nenough to prove that.\nBut in the end tennis was not bought in Fuling. The banquets ended after\nfour weeks. Within a month the college stopped buying things for our\napartments. It wasn’t long before we were complaining like spoiled children\nthat our needs were neglected, but we grumbled lightly and to ourselves, high\nabove campus in our cadres’ apartments.\nTHE CROQUET SOUNDS drifted up to my apartment in the mornings—\nthe gentle knock of the ball, the sound of shuffled footsteps on hard dirt, the\nsoft chatter and laughter of the retirees as they played without hurry. These\nwere some of the most soothing sounds I had ever heard, and often I sat out\non my balcony and simply listened, the croquet sounds backed by the\nunsteady hum of the cicadas and the noise of the Wu River. Boat horns",
        "echoed across the narrow river valley, and motors sputtered against the\ncurrent, and barges clanked as they unloaded sand onto rumbling trucks at the\nwater’s edge. A mile from my apartment, the Wu died in the brown rush of\nthe Yangtze, and often I could hear a lonely horn booming out from the big\nriver.\nAt the beginning, Fuling was mostly sounds to me. It was a loud city, but\nalso the noises were different from anything I had known before—the steady\nclinking of chisels at construction sites, the crush of rock broken with a\nsledgehammer: these were the sounds of a place where much of the work was\nstill done by hand. And it was the first time I had lived next to a river,\nlistening to the boat noises and the way they echoed up and down the valley.\nMy apartment was on the top floor of a building high on a hill above the\nWu River. It was a pretty river, fast and clean, and it ran from the wild\nsouthern mountains of Guizhou province. Across the Wu River was the main\ncity of Fuling, a tangle of blocky concrete buildings rising up the hillside.\nEverywhere I looked, the hills were steep, especially due north, where the\nheavy shape of White Flat Mountain loomed sheer above the junction of the\ntwo rivers.\nThat was the view from my aerie—high on the sixth floor, far above the\nrivers and their town. Nothing blocked my view, which was another reason I\nheard so much. Long before the croquet sounds began every morning, I heard\nthe rooster behind the building start to crow, and I heard the morning alarm\ngo off all over campus at six o’clock. I heard the students as they jogged\ngroggily to the small road that ran through campus, where they did their\nmorning exercises. The exercise music started shortly after six, broadcast\nover the loudspeakers—morning—cheerful, workout-repetitive music, the\nsame day after day. After exercises there were announcements, and\npropaganda, and the sound of students getting their breakfast; and then there\nwere the bells for morning class and the first soft echoes rising up from the\ncroquet court.\nI lived next to the main teaching building and I heard those sounds as\nwell. I heard students repeating their lessons, because in Fuling much was\nlearned by rote. That was also a soothing sound; there was something\nsatisfying about hearing their voices rise and fall in unison as they recited\nlessons that all of them had learned. And I liked hearing the teachers’ voices\nonce class started, and the jumbled noise of the ten-minute breaks, and the",
        "electronic bells and the eager rush of the lunch hour.\nNone of these noises bothered me. The early sounds woke me but that\nwas fine, because they were part of the routine of the college and hearing\nthem made me feel as if I were also in step. I wasn’t, of course—and in some\nways I never fell in. But during those early weeks I would have felt even\nmore disjointed if it hadn’t been for the steady routines that surrounded me.\nEverything followed a strict timetable. There was the morning routine—\nthe exercises, the bells, the classes—and often in the afternoons there was the\nwhisk of brooms as the students did their mandatory campus cleaning. On\nMondays and Thursdays they cleaned their classrooms. Sunday nights were\npolitical meetings, when the students gathered to give speeches and sing\nsongs. Sometimes they sang patriotic anthems, but mostly they sang love\nsongs, their voices echoing across the nighttime campus.\nAt the start of the year, the freshmen had military training. Each class\nformed a regiment, boys and girls together, and People’s Liberation Army\nsoldiers came to teach them how to salute, goose-step, execute turns, and\nstand at attention. During their military training they also learned songs—that\nseemed to be a way to make Communism fun. Our students were always\nsinging patriotic songs for one organization or another.\nFor their military training, the freshmen wore the class uniform, which\nconsisted of powder-blue Adidas-knockoff sweat suits. Their bright uniforms\nseemed incongruous next to the military stiffness of the camouflaged\ninstructors, and so did the students. They were in their early twenties but\nmost looked younger, fresh off the farm, and they cowered under the leaders’\ninstructions. On hot days some of them fainted and were carried to the shade\nwhile the rest of the class continued goose-stepping. At the end of the two-\nweek training, when they had their steps down, they marched out to the rifle\nrange in a deep corner of Mo Pan Valley, where, as a punctuation to their\ninitiation, they blew the hell out of targets with high-powered rifles. I heard\nthat as well, the bursts of gunfire drowning out the sounds of the Wu River.\nCampus quieted early at night. The dormitory lights went out at eleven\no’clock sharp—all of them at once, a row of buildings going black as the\nelectricity was cut. Sometimes I sat out on my balcony at night, watching the\nlights go out, and again there was something soothing about the regularity of\nit all.\nFrom my balcony the city was beautiful at night. During the day Fuling",
        "was a dirty river town, and you could see that much of it had been built too\nquickly, but at night all of the flaws disappeared. It was only water and lights\n—the brilliant lights and the dark water, the deep black mirror of the Wu\nRiver streaked with red and yellow and white. Sometimes a night boat\nslipped upriver, steadily pushing a triangle of light ahead of its prow, the\nmotor coughcoughcoughing in the darkness of the valley. And every half\nhour or so there would be a big passenger boat on the Yangtze, a bright band\nof lights floating past in majestic silence.\nI didn’t really understand any of the routines. I didn’t know where the\nboats were going and I didn’t know why the college was regulated the way it\nwas. They played croquet differently than we do in America, but I never\nbothered to figure out the Fuling rules. I simply liked their playing every day\n—the regularity was what mattered. Nor did I ever think much about the\nmilitary training, until I read one of my students’ journal as she described a\ntypical afternoon in the college:\nIt’s sunny, the first year students are doing their military training.\nThey walked again and again. Although the sweat is dropping down\nfrom their head, they can’t stop without the permission of their leader.\nOf course, in this way, they know how hard the army life is. Their\nspirits can be discouraged.\nEveryone should have a strong sense of patriotism, especially the\ncollege students. Our state costs a lot of money to educate them. They\nshould be faithful to their motherland. Army force is a symbol of the\npower of a country, so it’s necessary to have some knowledge about\nmilitary. In 1989, there was a student movement in Beijing. For the\nyouth, their thoughts don’t ripe and they don’t have their own ideas, so\nthe surroundings can influence them easily. Also they can’t tell the truth\nfor the fault. Where there is exciting thing, they turn up. After the\nmovement, our state decides to have military training in college, to make\nthem understand that it is not easy to obtain our present life.\nThat was what I had actually been hearing—the marching and the distant\ngunshots were the echoes of the Tiananmen Square protests. I realized that",
        "there was more to the routines of the college than I had first imagined, and\nafter that I began to listen more carefully to the sounds that filtered up to my\naerie high above the Wu River.\nMUCH OF WHAT I LEARNED in the early days was from the students.\nMy Chinese wasn’t yet good enough to talk with the people in town, which\nmade the city overwhelming—a mess of miscommunication. And so I\nlistened to my students, reading what they wrote in their journals for class,\nand parts of Fuling slowly began to draw into focus.\nThe first thing I saw was myself and Adam. This was intimidating,\nbecause never in my life had I been watched so closely that every action was\nreplayed and evaluated. Everything we did was talked and written about;\nevery quirk or habit was laid bare. Students wrote about the way I always\ncarried a water bottle to class; they wrote about how I paced the classroom as\nI taught; they wrote about my laugh, which they found ridiculous. They wrote\nabout my foreign nose, which impressed them as impossibly long and\nstraight, and many of them wrote about my blue eyes. This was perhaps the\nstrangest detail of all, because my eyes are hazel—but my students had read\nthat foreigners had blue eyes, and they saw what they wanted to see.\nMostly they wanted to see all of the outside world condensed into these\ntwo young waiguoren, which was what foreigners were called in Fuling\n—“people from outside the country.” One afternoon, Adam and I threw a\nFrisbee around the front plaza after dinner, and by the next day, when I read\none student’s journal, the lazy game had become Olympian:\nWhen I was writing my composition, someone shouted at the classes:\n‘Pete and Adam are playing Frisbee!’ At once, I put down my pen and\nrushed out the classroom. Really, they are! I wanted to see it clearly and\ndidn’t want to miss any scene. I ran into the classroom and put the\nglasses on my nose, then dashed to the classroom again. I can see it\nclearly now!…The two sports men stood far away from Frisbee each\nother and began to play. How wonderful it looked! The Frisbee was like\na red fire, flying person to person between the two men. I have seen it\nfor a long time. Foreigners are so versatile.",
        "Other descriptions were less heroic. My favorite was written by a student\nnamed Richard, in an essay entitled “Why Americans Are So Casual”:\nI’m a Chinese. As we all know, the Chinese nation is a rather\nconservative nation. So many of us have conservative thinking in some\ndegree. I don’t know whether it is bad or good.\nOur foreign language teachers—Peter and Adam—came to teach us\nthis term. It provides a good opportunity of understanding the American\nway of life. In my opinion, they are more casual than us Chinese people.\nWhy do I think so? I’ll give you some facts to explain this.\nFor example, when Mr. Hessler is having class, he can scratch himself\ncasually without paying attention to what others may say. He dresses up\ncasually, usually with his belt dropping and dangling. But, to tell you the\ntruth, it isn’t consider a good manner in China, especially in old people’s\neyes. In my opinion, I think it is very natural.\nLast week, when Miss Thompson [another Peace Corps volunteer who\nvisited Fuling] gave us a lecture on the American election, she took off\nher woolen sweater and tied it to her waist. To us Chinese people, it’s\nalmost unimaginable. How can a teacher do that when she/he is having a\nlesson! But thanks goodness, we major in English and know something\nabout America, it didn’t surprise us. But if other people saw this, they\nmight can’t believe their own eyes.\nIt was an easy place to make mistakes, and plenty were made. But the\nlocals tended to be forgiving—usually they gave us a hint, a nudge in the\nright direction. During the first week of class, Adam had his students\nintroduce themselves, and a girl named Keller stood up. She told the name of\nher hometown, and she explained that she had chosen her English name in\nhonor of Helen Keller. This was a common pattern; some of them had taken\ntheir names from people they admired, which explained why we had a\nBarbara (from Barbara Bush), an Armstrong (Neil Armstrong), and an\nidealistic second-year student called Marx. A few had translated their\nChinese names directly—House, Yellow, North. There was one boy whose",
        "English name was Lazy. “My name is Lazy,” he said, on the first day of\nclass. “I am very lazy. I do not like to play basketball or football or do many\nthings. My hobbies are sleeping.”\nOther names made less sense. There was a Soddy, a Sanlee, a Ker. Some\nwere simply unfortunate: a very small boy called Pen, a very pretty girl\nnamed Coconut. One boy was called Daisy, a name that greatly dismayed\nDean Fu. The dean was a handsome man with blue-black hair, and he was\nour main liaison with the English department—a position whose weight of\nresponsibility often gave him a mournful air. He seemed particularly morose\nwhen he called me into his office to talk about Daisy.\n“That’s a girl’s name, isn’t it?” Dean Fu asked.\n“Yes,” I said. “Except now in America even girls don’t like that name.”\n“I remember it from The Great Gatsby,” Dean Fu said, smiling sadly. As\na student his specialty had been American literature, and he was familiar with\nvirtually all of the great twentieth-century novelists. He sighed and shook his\nhead.\n“Last year that student had a boy’s name,” said the dean. “He changed it\nover the summer. I don’t know why.”\nI didn’t know either—I never talked with Daisy about it. He wasn’t easy\nto speak with, and all I ever learned about him was that his lifelong goal of\nbeing a soldier had been crushed when the People’s Liberation Army turned\nhim down because of bad eyesight. This was a failure that illuminated the\nmystery of Daisy’s existence; he was a tall, taciturn boy with an air of deep\nsadness, and every day he wore a full camouflage uniform to class. Whether\nit was consolation or a form of self-punishment, I never knew. I simply liked\nhaving a tall camouflaged boy named Daisy sitting in the back of my class,\nand I never would have asked him to change either his name or his uniform. I\ndidn’t tell that to Dean Fu, of course.\nBut Keller’s name was very straightforward. Helen Keller was a common\nheroine among the students—even some of the boys listed her as a role\nmodel, partly because she had had Communist sympathies. On the day that\nKeller introduced herself, she explained the reasons for her name, and then\nshe smiled.\n“Thank you,” Adam said. “You have very nice freckles, Keller.”\nThe classroom suddenly became very still. Keller’s face fell and she sat\ndown quickly. In the awkward silence Adam floundered for a moment, and",
        "then he hurriedly explained that in America freckles are considered attractive.\nWhich, it turned out, is not the case in China—his compliment was like\nsaying “You have a nice birthmark.” But there was nothing to do except\ncontinue the lesson, and in a few minutes the awkwardness had passed.\nBut it wasn’t forgotten. A week later two students mentioned the incident\nin their journals, trying, in the Chinese way, to communicate the message\nindirectly:\nI have heard of that there are so many American women have freckles\non their faces. In China, women especially girls who have freckles on\ntheir faces do not like other people to mention it. It’s bad manner. I want\nto know what do the American women who have freckles think of it?\nSome of their [the foreign teachers’] teaching methods are\nacceptable…. We should affirm their achievements. But sometimes they\nalso make some students embarassed due to their absence of Chinese\ncustom. We Chinese have our own taboos. We never make frivolous\nremarks about people’s appearanc. But one of these two American\nteachers broke this taboo once in class. But I think, with the time on, up\ntheir knowledge of Chinese daily life, would some embarransements be\navoided.\nAND SO WE BUMBLED ON. We were naive, of course—we trusted good\nintentions and hard work, and we thought that soon we would slip into the\nroutines of the city without much problem. But like most parts of the country,\nFuling had a complicated past, and I had no real understanding of this history,\nregardless of how many books I had read about the Great Leap Forward and\nthe Cultural Revolution.\nMore specifically, I didn’t recognize what it meant for this particular part\nof China to finally have American residents. Later I would learn that much of\nthe local industry had been moved here from Shanghai as a direct result of\nthe American nuclear threat in the 1950s and 1960s, when Mao Zedong",
        "dispersed China’s military factories throughout the remote mountains of the\nsouthwest. It was inevitable that such a past would have some effect on the\nway locals viewed us, but we knew nothing about this chapter in history.\nProbably it would have been harder if we had known more. One of my\nfavorite students was a girl named Anne, whose family lived on the ground\nfloor of our building. Her father was a math professor, the highest-ranking\nfaculty member on campus, and this was an honor that had earned him a\nplace in our exclusive building. It had also earned him a job in a remote\nSichuan coal mine for eight years of the Cultural Revolution. Like so many\nother talented Chinese, he had been banished as an intellectual, or chou\nlaojiu, “the Old Stinking Ninth”, the lowest of the low, the ones who could be\nsaved only by the basest and most tedious labor.\nThose years seemed to sit lightly on Professor Liang—he was a cheerful\nman, undoubtedly happy to have been politically rehabilitated. Even in the\ncoal mine he had made the best of the situation, winning the locals’\nadmiration by showing them how to balance their accounts. But I thought that\nperhaps the past had somehow affected his daughter more, even though she\nhad not lived through his experience. She was one of the brightest students in\nthe class, and also one of the few who stood apart. Her ideas were different—\nshe liked being alone, and she made up her own mind; she was capable of\nveering away from the political cant that most of them rehashed. Of all my\nstudents, I expected her to be the most open-minded to me as a foreigner.\nAnd yet after her graduation she wrote a letter and explained honestly how it\nhad been at the beginning:\nNot long after you became my teacher, I read a piece of old news\ncomment that said Mr. Clinton took presidency, one of the reasons [why\nthe Americans had elected him] was that he would take stronger\nmeasure on China. Those days, I hated to see you and Mr. Meier.\nIn the first few months I never would have guessed that such feelings\nwere so strong, although there were occasional signs that my students still\nviewed the outside world with mistrust. I treated these moments as isolated\nincidents—I responded, usually gently, and then I tried to think no more",
        "about it. One day a female student named Catherine wrote about the\ndifferences between women in the East and the West:\nPeople in the west like the girl who is elegant or the girl who is\nsexuality? But I always heard a view that girl in the east is famous for\nher elegance and the girl in the west is famous for her sexuality.\nThe girls in China, most of them are elegant, refined, and kind. They\nalways do something following rules. It’s the Chinese tradition.\nBut the girls in the west are very open to outside. They can marry\nanyone and get divorced whenever. Don’t mind the appraise of others.\nThey can do everything that she wants to do, not concern about whether\nit’s wrong or right. They lead a loose life.\nI think I like the statue and virtue of the girl in the east. They are\nelegant, refined.\nCatherine was a lovely girl, a quiet student with eager eyes and a friendly\nsmile, and I couldn’t be harsh. Below her journal entry, I simply wrote that in\nAmerica I had three sisters—and I left it at that. In Fuling that sort of\ncommunication was enough; a day later she apologized.\nShe wrote about being “open,” which was a watershed issue for the\npeople in Fuling, and, in turn, for all of China. People everywhere talked\nabout Gaige Kaifang, Reform and Opening, which included both increased\ncontact with the outside world and the Capitalist-style economic reforms that\nDeng Xiaoping had initiated in 1978. To a certain degree, Reform and\nOpening was similar to the Russian concepts of Perestroika and Glasnost,\nwith one critical difference: the Chinese term lacked an explicit political\ncomponent, as the country’s leaders had no intention of opening the political\nsystem in the manner of Gorbachev. Nevertheless, Reform and Opening\nresulted in massive social changes, ranging from increased mobility between\nregions to new styles and attitudes that were influenced by foreign cultures.\nMost Chinese people saw these as positive developments, because they were\naccompanied by rising living standards, but there were still quiet fears that\nlurked in people’s minds. And simply having the first American teachers in\nFuling was enough to trigger these uncertainties.",
        "I was too overwhelmed to dwell on such matters during that first\nsemester. I was studying Chinese, preparing lessons, and writing in my\njournal; I didn’t have time to worry about the political implications of our\narrival. But still there were moments that shook me—like the time I read part\nof an entry in a student journal, three short sentences that echoed in my mind\nlong after the grading was finished:\nToday’s China has been opened to the foreign countries. The\ncriminals have been increased. It’s important to maintain public order.\nNONE OF THAT seemed too important in the early months. I copied the\ninteresting remarks in my journal, and then I moved on. I sensed that I simply\ncouldn’t judge the students for anything they thought, at least in the\nbeginning. Their backgrounds were too far removed from what I had known\nbefore coming to Fuling, and, like all young Chinese, they were surrounded\nby the aura of a troubled past. It was easy to forget this—it was easy to laugh\nat their ridiculous names, or smile at their childlike shyness, and it was easy\nto dismiss them as simple young people from the simplicity of the\ncountryside. But of course nothing was farther from the truth—the Sichuan\ncountryside is not simple, and my students had known things that I had never\nimagined. Even if appearances were deceiving, the truth always came through\nin the way they wrote about their homes and families:\nIn real life, I think my father is a hero. Once he told us his past. When\nhe was about ten years old, his elder brother and sisters had been\nmarried and worked far from home. At that time, China was following a\nroad of collectivization, and people were taking a collective productive\nlabour. They couldn’t have their own property.\nBefore those days, my grandparents made a lot of property through\nhard work, but when the collective productive labour began, the\nproperty of my family were all destroyed by the “revolution group.”\nThey said all things belonged to the public, then they took some good\nthings away. My grandma wanted to stop them, but failed. They hanged\nup and beat her and refused to give her something to eat. Later she died",
        "from starving, then they forced my father to weed in water field in\nwinter. My father didn’t complain, just worked hard.\nMost of their grandmothers had had bound feet; few of their grandfathers\nhad been able to read. Their parents had come of age during one of the most\nhorrible periods in Chinese history. All of this affected my students and\nshaped who they were, but at the same time they were something entirely\ndifferent. They were educated, and although few of them had much money,\nthey weren’t desperately poor. They could buy things—fashionable clothes,\nbooks, radios. They went to college. They had studied English for seven\nyears. They had seen great changes, both political and economic. Perhaps by\nmy standards they were politically brainwashed, but compared to the past\nthey were remarkably free.\nThey were a watershed generation, in the same way that “opening” was a\nwatershed issue for China. I sensed that a great deal depended on the people\nof this age group—in some ways it was like the American generation of my\nparents, who grew up on stories of the Depression and World War II, and\nwho built the America of today, for better or worse. There was the same\nsense of future glory in China, but the past was far more brutal than anything\nthat had ever happened in America, which complicated things. My students\nhad difficulty criticizing anything Chinese, and this was not surprising,\nbecause they were constantly being indoctrinated by the Communist Party.\nOccasionally some of my better students wrote about China with a mixture of\ncool accuracy and blind optimism that gave me some sense of how wonderful\nand difficult it was to be a young Chinese:\nI think, in the history of the People’s Republic of China, there are two\ngreat men: Mao Zedong and Deng Xiaoping. We should mention the\ntwo men if we want to point out the difference between two generations’\nviews on China.\nWhen my parents were at my age, China wasn’t rich. Even the people\ncouldn’t live the type of dressing warmly and eating there fill. The\nsituation was very hard at that time. Because of lack of experience, the\nleaders of China didn’t solve some questions very well. Maybe, that",
        "period was the hardest within the progress of China. But, there is a fact\nthat is beyond all question: it was Mao Zedong and his comrades that\nfounded the People’s Republic of China, and brought the Chinese people\nindependence and democracy which is a long cherished goal for the\nChinese. So, people admired him from the bottom of their heart. This\nkind of admiration led to people’s profound love to China to a great\nextent. My parents did the same. It was the Great Cultural Revolution\nthen; there were many wrong things in life. But they thought China was\nthe best and perfect country and had splendid position. In their minds,\nChina would reach its great goal only by performing planned economy\nbecause it was a socialist country. Anything about market economy was\nRight deviation. My parents only did what they were ordered to do and\ndidn’t consider whether they were true or false.\nToday, when we see those days with our own sight, we’ll feel our\nparents’ thoughts and actions are somewhat blind and fanatical. But if\nwe consider that time objectly, I think, we should understand and can\nunderstand them. Each generation has its own happiness and sadness. To\nyounger generation, the important thing is understanding instead of\ncriticising. Our elder generation was unlucky; they didn’t own a good\nchance and circumstances to realize their value. But, their spirit, their\nlove to our country set a good example for us.\nIT WAS HARD for me to imagine a better job. My students were eager and\nrespectful, and they were bright. The college was not prestigious, but in\nChina less than 2 percent of the population attend any schooling beyond high\nschool, which meant that even Fuling’s students were a very select group. In\nfact I was glad to be at a lower-level school, because there was an unpolished\nquality to the students that I had never seen before. Everywhere else I had\nbeen, education rounded off the edges much earlier—in America, even high\nschool students were cagey, cynical, suspicious. Education was a game and\nstudents played it, but in Fuling they hadn’t yet reached that point. Their\nintelligence was still raw—it smelled of the countryside, of sweat and muck,\nof night soil and ripening rapeseed and everything else that composed the\nSichuanese farmland. And in their thoughts were flashes of the land, glimpses\nof the same sort of hard beauty that surrounded the teachers college, where",
        "the campus ended in terraced fields that ran steep up the side of Raise the\nFlag Mountain.\nIt shone through brightly in some of them. We had one student named\nKer—like so many of the students’ English names, his was a puzzle. He was\none of the quietest boys in class and he looked like a middle-aged peasant:\nshort, stocky, his face tanned and weathered by the Sichuan sun. He had a\npeasant’s quiet smile, and a peasant’s modest politeness, and he had been a\npeasant until the day the government sent a letter informing him that his\nexamination scores had won him admission to Fuling Teachers College. Now\nhe was twenty-one years old, the youngest student in his section, and one day\nAdam assigned a fifteen-minute free writing. Ker put his head down and\nwrote:\nI’m working in the fields. The ox suddenly becomes a machine with\nan ox head. So I finish my task ahead of time. Because of that I am\nrecommended to be the leader of our town. Then I go to Beijing by air to\nreport my deeds to President Jiang Zemin. He doesn’t believe it’s true,\nbecause he’s never seen a machine with an ox head. He orders that I be\nsent to prison. On my way to prison, my ox appears. It becomes a train\nwith an ox head and…\nMy fortune and my changing ox is closely connected.\nFortunately I get back with the help of the train-like ox. I go into the\ntown government office. The ox, now it is really an ox, follows me and\nmurmurs something. I can’t catch what it said. It turns into a computer\nwhich looks like an ox head. The screen shows: My young master, you\nare not suitable for politics. What you should do now is to go to school\nto learn more knowledge. Especial your English is too poor. Only in this\nway can you do your job better and live a more happy life….\nPerhaps for the ox’s advice I will abandoned farmwork for study.\nThere was a great deal of Sichuan in those two hundred words, and yet it\nseemed so effortless—but of course there was more to it than met the eye.\nThe first time Adam had assigned a free writing, it had not gone according to\nplan. He explained to the class that they would have fifteen minutes, and then",
        "he told them to “write about anything you want.”\nThe students wrote. At the end of the hour Adam collected their papers.\nThey had written about anything they wanted, and what he had was forty-five\nshopping lists. I want a new TV, a new dress, a new radio. I want more\ngrammar books. I want my own room. I want a beeper and a cell phone and a\ncar. I want a good job. Some of the students had lists a full page long, every\nentry numbered and prioritized.\nIt wasn’t exactly what Adam had intended, but nevertheless there was a\ngreat deal of Sichuan in those lists as well. The next time, Adam explained\nvery carefully that they should “write about any subject you want to write\nabout.”\nThat worked better. Ker put his head down and wrote. And Adam and I\nkept plugging away, learning from our mistakes and trying to fit into the local\nroutines.",
        "THE CITY\nTHERE ARE NO BICYCLES in Fuling. Otherwise it is similar to any\nother small Chinese city—loud, busy, dirty, crowded; the traffic twisted, the\npedestrians jostling each other; shops overstaffed and full of goods, streets\ncovered with propaganda signs; no traffic lights, drivers honking constantly;\ntelevisions blaring, people bickering over prices; and along the main streets\nrows of frightened-looking trees, their leaves gray with coal dust, the same\ngray dust that covers everything in the city.\nThere are no bicycles because Fuling is full of steps, and the city is full of\nsteps because it is squeezed close on the mountains that press against the\njunction of the Wu and Yangtze Rivers. Narrow streets also rise from the\nriverbanks, switchbacking up the hills, but they are cramped and indirect and\ntoo steep for bicycles. Automobile traffic tangles on the sharp corners. And\nso the long stone staircases are the true boulevards of Fuling, carrying most\nof its traffic—shoppers descending the stairs, pausing to browse in stores;\nporters climbing up, shoulders bowed under the weight of crates and bundles.\nVirtually every necessary good or service can be found along these\nstairways and their landings. There are shops and restaurants, cobblers and\nbarbers. One of the lower stairways is lined with Daoist fortune-tellers.\nAnother staircase is home to a group of three dentists who work at a table\ncovered with rusty tools, syringes in mysterious fluids, and pans of cruelly\ndefeated teeth—a sort of crude advertisement. Sometimes a peasant will stop\nto have his tooth pulled, after haggling over the price, and a crowd will gather\nto watch. Everything is public. A haircut comes with an audience. The price\nof any purchase is commented on by the other shoppers who pause as they\npass. For medical problems one can sit in the open air and see a traditional\nChinese physician, who has a regular stand near the top of one of the\nstairways. His stand consists of a stool, a box of bottles, and a white sheet\nwith big characters that say:",
        "To Help You Relieve Worries and Solve Problems! Particular\nTreatments: Corns, Sluggishness, Black Moles, Ear Checks. Surgery—\nNo Pain, No Itching, No Bloodletting, No Effects on Your Job!\nFuling is not an easy city. Old people rest on the staircases, panting. To\ncarry anything up the hills is backbreaking work, and so the city is full of\nporters. They haul their loads on bamboo poles balanced across their\nshoulders, the same way freight was carried in the south of China in the\n1800s, when the English referred to such laborers as “coolies”—from the\nChinese kuli, or “bitter strength.” Here in Fuling, as in all of the eastern\nSichuan river towns, the porters are called Bang-Bang Jun—the Stick-Stick\nArmy. They have uniforms (the simple blue clothes of the Chinese\npeasantry), and the weapons of their trade (bamboo poles and loops of cheap\nrope), and they tend to gather in packs, in companies, in battalions. To\nbargain with one stick-stick soldier is to bargain with a regiment. Their jobs\nare difficult enough without cutthroat competition, and they look out for each\nother; there is no formal union but the informal bond of hard labor is much\ncloser. During midday, when most people rest, the stick-stick soldiers can be\nseen along the midtown streets, sitting on their poles, smoking, chatting,\nplaying cards; and in their leisure there is an air not so much of relaxation as\nof a lull in the battle.\nMost of them are peasants who have farms in the mountains outside of\nFuling, and usually there is a wife or a brother tending the land while they try\ntheir luck carrying loads on the docks. There is always an especially heavy\nflood of stick-stick soldiers during the winter, because that is the light season\nin the countryside. But never is there any shortage of these men, and there is\nsomething eerie in their silent ubiquity. They stand five deep in front of\ntelevision stores, staring at the wall of screens. If a foreigner eats at a\nstreetside stand, ten stick-stick soldiers will gather to watch. If there is an\nargument on the docks, they will cluster close, all of them dressed in blue,\nholding their bamboo poles and listening intently. Occasionally a small\nvariety show will stop in Fuling and pitch its tent on the river flats, fronted by\nan advertisement featuring more or less undressed dancing girls, and",
        "invariably there is a lost regiment of stick-stick soldiers gaping at the\nmarquee. An auto accident is not truly an auto accident unless a company of\nstick-stick soldiers arrives to gaze at the damage. They are quiet men—even\nthe most grisly wreck sometimes fails to inspire them to words—and they\nnever interfere. They simply watch.\nBut to see them work is to understand why they so often rest, because in a\nhard city there is no harder job. For a load they generally make one or two\nyuan—there are slightly more than eight yuan to the American dollar—and\nroutinely these workers carry more than one hundred pounds up the\nstaircases. They are short, stocky men, their bodies shaped by the hilly city\nand the nature of their work. In summer, when they go without shirts, you can\nsee where the bamboo poles have burnished the skin along their shoulders\nlike leather. In hot weather they are drenched in sweat; in winter their bodies\nsteam. Below rolled-up trousers their calves bulge as if baseballs have been\ntied to the backs of their legs.\nFuling is a city of legs—the gnarled calves of a stick-stick soldier, the\nbowed legs of an old man, the willow-thin ankles of a xiaojie, a young\nwoman. You watch your step when climbing the stairways; you keep your\nhead down and look at the legs of the person in front of you. It is possible,\nand very common, to spend a morning shopping in Fuling and never once\nlook up at the buildings. The city is all steps and legs.\nAnd many of the buildings are not worth looking at. There is still an old\nsection along the banks of the Wu River, where beautiful ancient structures of\nwood and stone are topped by gray tiled roofs. But this district is shrinking,\nsteadily being replaced by the nondescript modern buildings that already\ndominate the city. There are a few tall ones, seven or more stories, but they\nare cheaply made of blue glass and white tile like so many new structures in\nChina. And even if you built a beautiful new building in Fuling, it would\nquickly fade beneath the gray layers of dust.\nThe city is different from the land in that, apart from the small old\ndistrict, there is no sense of the past. To travel through the Sichuan\ncountryside is to feel the history, the years of work that have shaped the land,\nthe sheer weight of humanity on patches of earth that have been worked in\nthe same way for centuries. But Sichuanese cities are often timeless. They\nlook too dirty to be new, and too uniform and ugly to be old. The majority of\nFuling’s buildings look as if they were dropped here about ten years ago,",
        "while in fact the city has existed on the same site for more than three\nthousand years. Originally it was a capital of the Ba Kingdom, an\nindependent tribe that was conquered by the Chinese, and after that nearly\nevery dynasty left it with a different name, a different administrative center: it\nwas Jixian under the Zhou Dynasty, Fuling under the Han, Jixian under the\nJin, Hanping under the Northern Zhou, Liangzhou under the Sui, Fuzhou\nunder the Tang, Kuizhou under the Song, Chongqing under the Yuan and\nMing, Fuzhou under the Qing, Fuling under the Republic of China that was\nfounded in 1912.\nBut all of those dynasties have passed with hardly a mark left behind. The\nbuildings could be the buildings of any Chinese city whose development has\nswallowed its history. Their purpose is simply to hold people, the more than\n200,000 people who spend their days climbing the staircases, fighting the\ntraffic, working and eating, buying and selling.\nDAWN. A cool morning, the city covered in haze. Retirees practice taiji in\nthe small park near South Mountain Gate, the central intersection. Fuling is\nrelatively quiet—as quiet as it gets. There is a steady stream of traffic, and\nalready many of the drivers are honking their horns; but the roads are not\ncongested and the noise of the city is not yet overpowering. It is a pleasant\nmorning.\nThe retirees are lined up neatly in rows. A radio plays traditional Chinese\nmusic, and the old people move slowly, gracefully. The park is tiny—not so\nmuch a park as a lull in the city. There are stunned bushes and exhausted\nflowers and broken-hearted patches of grass. But all of it is well cared for—\nvandalism of public property is not a problem in Fuling. The problem is the\nair, the coal dust that blankets the city and chokes the greenery. Few things\nare more pathetic than a tree in Fuling, its leaves gray and dull as if it were\njust taken out of the attic.\nThe roar of the city rises as sunshine fills the haze in the eastern sky. It is\na mottled medley of sounds: honking horns, roaring television shops, blaring\ncassette tape stands, the uneven buzz of streetside salespeople calling out to\nthe passersby. East of South Mountain Gate there is a sudden reprieve, a\ncompletely different strain, the soft but piercing music of an erhu played by a",
        "blind man.\nErhu means “two strings”—that is all. It is a simple name for a simple\nmusical instrument: a cylindrical wooden sound box covered by python skin\nand topped by an upright handle with two strings stretched taut along its\nlength. It looks something like a crude two-stringed violin. But that pair of\nstrings has a rich soulful range and the erhu, played well, makes haunting\nmusic.\nToday the blind man is playing well. He is about forty years of age, but\nhis face looks older: tanned and creased, his eyes pinched shut. He wears\ndirty blue clothes and green army surplus sneakers. He sits on a low stool,\nand next to him is a cloth covered with poorly written characters. His nine-\nyear-old daughter stands nearby with a glass jar half full of money. A small\ncrowd has gathered, because the erhu’s music, despite the blaring horns and\nthe noise of rushing passersby, is powerful enough to make people stop and\nlisten. They read the words on the cloth:\nA Brief Story of a Household\nAt twenty years I was married, and at twenty-two I lost the sight of\nboth eyes. Eleven years after marriage I had a boy child, and then on\nDecember 2 of 1988 I had my second child, a daughter. My wife and I\nshared the care of the two children, tried to survive on the land of our\nhousehold. But our family was short of hands, and we had trouble,\nbecause grain and money were unreliable. The woman had to drag all of\nthese people behind her by the strength of her own effort, and indeed\nfinally she was unable to continue living. For this reason, we were\nforced to flee on January 8 of 1996.\nBecause of my two lost eyes, I was not able to live from day to day!\nOn March 2 of 1996 I was forced to send my son to live with his\nmother’s father. My son was fourteen years old, and without money we\ncould not send the boy to school. I hope that all of you uncles and aunts,\nfathers and mothers, brothers and sisters, will extend your warm hands\nto help me! My heart extends ten thousand thanks! I wish you success in\nyour work! Happiness and a long life!",
        "Above all of this the erhu plays. Effortlessly the music rises and falls, the\nvoice flowing from the snakeskin-bound box, never drowned out by the\nrushing cars, the stream of pedestrians, the nearby televisions. At last the man\nstops. Gently he lays down the erhu and takes out his pipe. With his fingers\nhe feels the rough roll of tobacco, and then he calls for his daughter. She\nlights the pipe, carefully. The blind man inhales deeply and sits back to rest,\nsurrounded by the rising roar of the morning city.",
        "CHAPTER TWO",
        "Shakespeare with Chinese Characteristics\nIN FULING I taught English and American literature. I also had classes in\nwriting and speaking, but most of my time was spent teaching lit. There were\ntwo sections of third-year students, and I taught each of them four hours a\nweek. Our textbooks started with Beowulf and continued through twelve\ncenturies and across the ocean to William Faulkner’s “A Rose for Emily.”\nIt was a great deal of ground to cover. The Peace Corps suggested that we\nnot be too ambitious with such courses, given our students’ backgrounds and\nthe fact that many of them had relatively low levels of English\ncomprehension. It was recommended that we use literature to introduce\nimportant grammatical points, but this was an idea I didn’t like. I knew that I\nwas an uninspired teacher of the language’s technical aspects, and I also\nknew that Shakespeare is an even worse grammar instructor than me. And I\nhad studied literature for too long to use it as a segue to the present perfect\ntense.\nBut I still had some concerns. The students, after all, were from the\ncountryside, and it was true that their English—and especially their spoken\nEnglish—was sometimes poor. On the first day of class I asked them to jot\ndown the titles of any English-language books they had read, either in the\noriginal or translation, and I asked what they would like to study in my\ncourse:\nI enjoyed Hai Ming Wei, The Old Man and the Sea. I mostly want to\nstudy Hai Ming Wei.\nI mostly want to study Helen Keller’s and Shakespeare’s work.",
        "I’ve read Jack London and his The Call of Wild, Dicken and his The\nTale of Two Cities, O. Henry and his The Last Leaf, Shakespeare and\nhis King Lear (and that made me burst into tears).\nI’m most interested in Jane Eyre by Charlotte Bronte. I don’t know\nwhich periods it belonged to. I like Jane. I think she is a very common\nwomen, but she has a uncommon seeking. She dared to resist wife of\nmother’s brother and brother of cousinship. She is a progressive lady.\nShakespeare was the greatest of all English authors. I had read some\nof his works. Romeo and Juliet is a dire story. Romeo and Juliet love\neach other. But there was revengefulness between their families.\nAnd I have read “Farewell, Weapons,” which was written by\nHemingway. He was a tough man, but he killed himself.\nI looked at their responses and thought: I can work with this. For the first\nweek I assigned them Beowulf.\nI TAUGHT on the fifth floor of the main teaching building. There were\nforty-five students to a class, all of them pressed close together behind old\nwooden desks. The room was their responsibility. They washed the\nblackboards between classes, and twice a week they cleaned the floor and\nwindows. If the cleaning wasn’t adequate, the class was fined. That was how\neverything worked at the college—students were fined for missing morning",
        "exercises, for skipping class, for failing examinations, for returning late to\ntheir dormitories at night. Very few of them had extra money to spend in this\nway, and so twice a week the classrooms were diligently and thoroughly\ncleaned.\nEach room contained about fifteen more students than could comfortably\nfit, and it would have been claustrophobic if I hadn’t been able to teach with\nthe door open. Fortunately, there was plenty of space outside—the\nclassrooms were high above the Wu River, the same view that I had from my\napartment’s balcony: the fast-running Wu, the jumbled city, the muddy\nYangtze and the dark shape of White Flat Mountain.\nThat was what I saw to my left as I taught, and at the beginning it was\ndistracting. But there was always a good breeze coming off the rivers, which\nkept the room from becoming unbearably hot. If things got quiet—if I had the\nclass doing a writing assignment, or if they were working smoothly in small\ngroups—I’d gaze out the door at the traffic on the rivers: the little two-man\nfishing sampans, the crowded ferries crossing from one bank to the other, the\nbarges bringing coal and gravel north from the upper Wu, the big white\ntourist boats slipping down the Yangtze toward the Gorges. There was\nsomething deeply satisfying about teaching with that view, and I liked\nwatching the routines of the city in the same way that I liked listening to the\nroutines of the college. During class I used to look down at the traffic\nteeming on the rivers, at all of the fishermen and barge captains and dock\nworkers, and I’d think: I’m working, too. The city was moving and I was a\nsmall part of it.\nAt the beginning we read very little from the literature textbooks, because\neven the summaries were difficult, but it wasn’t hard to get at the material\nfrom other angles. Often I told the stories, acting them out with reluctant\nstudents I grabbed as “volunteers,” and the classes loved this—in a country\nwhere foreigners were often put on television simply because they were\nwaiguoren, a room full of students was completely entranced by a foreigner\nperforming Gawain and the Green Knight. Other days I gave them writing\nassignments; for Beowulf we talked about point of view, and they wrote about\nthe story from the perspective of Grendel, the monster. Almost without\nexception the boys wrote about what it was like to eat people, and how to do\nit properly; while the girls wrote about how cold and dark the moor was, and\nhow monsters have feelings too. One student named Grace wrote:",
        "The warriors said I am a monster, I can’t agree with them, but on the\ncontrary I think the warriors and the king are indeed monsters.\nYou see, they eat delicious foods and drinking every day. Where the\nfoods and drinking come from? They must deprive these things from\npeasants.\nThe king and the warriors do nothing but eat delicios foods; the\npeasants work hard every day, but have bad foods, even many of them\nhave no house to live, like me just live in the moor. So I think the world\nis unfair, I must change it.\nThe warriors, I hate them. I will punish them for the poor people. I\nwill ask the warriors build a large room and invited the poor people to\nlive with me.\nIn college I had been taught by a few Marxist critics, most of whom were\ntenured, with upper-class backgrounds and good salaries. They turned out\nplenty of commentary—often about the Body, and Money, and Exchange—\nbut somehow it didn’t have quite the same bite as Grace’s vision of Grendel\nas Marxist revolutionary. There was honesty, too—this wasn’t tweed\nMarxism; Grace, after all, was the daughter of peasants. She didn’t have\ntenure, and I had always felt that it was better if people who spoke feelingly\nof Revolution and Class Struggle were not tenured. And I figured that if you\nhave to listen to Marxist interpretations of literature, you might as well hear\nthem at a college where the students clean the classrooms.\nThe truth was that politics were unavoidable at a Chinese college, even if\nthe course was foreign literature, and in the end I taught English Literature\nwith Chinese Characteristics. We followed Gawain with a ballad about Robin\nHood, and I asked them to write a story about what would happen if Robin\nHood came to today’s China. A few followed the Party line:\nRobin Hood comes to and settles in China, leaving his own country.\nOn landing in the territory he is impressed by the peaceful country and\nfriendly, industrious Chinese. He knows that the bright pearl of the east\nis distinct from England in many aspects. Englishmen have no freedom,",
        "no rights. They are oppressed deep by their masters and exploiters and\nlive a dog’s life. Moreover, the gap between the rich and the poor is\nwidening. He hates such exploiting classes who lead a luxurious life\nbased on plundering the poor cruelly. But he does not seem to be\nadequate to overthrowing the rule.\nHowever, in China people are masters of the country, serving country\nis serving people. Some of the people are allowed to get wealthy first\nthrough honest and lawful labour [which] does not widen the gap\nbetween the rich and the poor, but leads the people to common\nprosperity. Robin Hood knows deeply the fact that it is unnecessary to\ntake something away from the rich by force as he did in England, but\nChina still needs justice and bravery. Cultural and ethical construction\nshould be fastened to development.\nBut most of them kept Robin Hood busy stealing from corrupt cadres and\ngreedy businessmen. Often they put him in the booming coastal regions, in\nShenzhen and Guangzhou and Xiamen, where reforms had freed the\neconomy and materialism was king. In their stories, Robin Hood stole from\nthe rich and gave to the peasants, and almost invariably he ended up in\nprison. Sometimes he was executed. One student had him successfully\nreeducated over a fifteen-year prison term (upon his release he became a\ndetective). But almost always Robin Hood was caught; there were no\nillusions about the idealized green world of Sherwood Forest. There are few\ntrees in China and the police always get their man.\nI had them debate about whether Robin Hood was a good role model for\ntoday’s China, which split them right down the middle. Some said that he\nwas like Mao Zedong, a revolutionary against injustice; they compared him\nto the heroes of the Long March and said that China would be nowhere\nwithout people like Robin Hood. Others answered that he was a Counter-\nRevolutionary, the sort of person who would stir up trouble and disturb the\neconomy. They pointed at what had happened during the Cultural Revolution\n—do you want constant Class Struggle with Robin Hood in the middle?\nWithin ten minutes they were no longer debating about Robin Hood.\nThey were arguing about China, and they were arguing about the political\ndogma with which all of them had been indoctrinated. Things quickly",
        "became heated. I sat in the back, listening to the mess of contrary ideas they\nhad been taught. Revolution was good—all of them knew that. Mao was a\nhero and the Long March had led to Liberation, which was the greatest\nmoment in Chinese history. But Counter-Revolution was bad—Tiananmen\nSquare protesters, pro-democracy activists; anything that agitated for change\nwas bad and against the Revolution. To be faithful to the Revolution, you\nshould support the status quo and the Communist Party—that was how you\nremained Revolutionary. Or was it? Robin Hood tangled them for an\nexhausting hour, every student speaking at least once, some of them angrily,\nand sitting in the back I wondered how you could ever make sense of it all.\nONE THING that I came to understand very early was that Fuling Teachers\nCollege served a dual purpose. It trained teachers, but like any Chinese\nschool it was also an educational extension of the Chinese Communist Party.\nEach Fuling student carried a red identity card at all times, and on the front\npage of the card were eight “Student Regulations.” The first three were as\nfollows:\n1. Ardently love the Motherland, support the Chinese Communist\nParty’s leadership, serve Socialism’s undertaking, and serve the\npeople.\n2. Diligently study Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought,\nprogressively establish a Proletariat class viewpoint, authenticate a\nviewpoint of Historical Materialism.\n3. Diligently study, work hard to master basic theory, career\nknowledge, and basic technical ability.\nIt wasn’t by accident that academic study came third. The top priority\nwas political: these students were being trained to be teachers, and as teachers\nthey would train China’s next generation, and all of this training was done\nwithin the framework of Chinese Communism. Everything else was",
        "secondary—and if it contradicted basic theory, it wasn’t taught.\nFirst-year students of all departments studied Marxism-Leninism, and\nduring their second year they took a course in law. Third-year students\nstudied Building Chinese Socialism, oblivious that the city across the Wu,\nwith its booming private businesses and bankrupt state-owned enterprises,\nwas a testimony to the Dismantling of Chinese Socialism that was happening\nall across the country. This was the strangest part of it all, the way students\ncould study and believe in Communist courses while free-market\ncontradictions sprang up all around the college. And they did believe in what\nthey were taught—most of the students were patriotic and faithful in the way\nthey were trained to be. They took their political meetings and rallies\nseriously, and they coveted the chance to join the Communist Party. In every\nclass perhaps 10 percent would have that opportunity; in the English\ndepartment, there were eight Party Members out of ninety third-year students.\nThey were some of the best in the class—the brightest, the most talented, the\nmost socially adept.\nThe second rule, which emphasized their duty to “authenticate a\nviewpoint of Historical Materialism,” explained a great deal about how\npolitical theory worked in China. I never gained more than a vague\nunderstanding of what Historical Materialism means—it has something to do\nwith Class Struggle—but authenticating was the key. Not investigating, or\ncontemplating, or analyzing—simply authenticating. They did whatever was\nnecessary to prove the theories correct, ignoring complications and\ncontradictions, and in the process they carefully used the appropriate terms. A\nfew times I asked students to explain what some of these phrases meant—\nHistorical Materialism, the People’s Democratic Dictatorship, Socialism with\nChinese Characteristics—but they were never able to answer in clear and\nsimple language. It was, as Orwell would say, a case in which words and\nmeaning had parted company. All that mattered was that students used the\ncorrect terminology and the correct political framework as they viewed the\nworld around them.\nOften it was difficult to see exactly where Adam and I fit into this vision\nof education. Adam taught American Culture, which used an English-\nlanguage textbook entitled Survey of Britain and America. The book had\nbeen published in 1994, and often its portrait of America was hardly\nrecognizable—for example, the chapter on American religion didn’t mention",
        "charities, communities, or schools, but said quite a bit about the Jonestown\nmass suicide. Another particularly vivid chapter was called “Social\nProblems.” Part of it read as follows:\nThe American society is developing very fast scientifically, while the\nspirit of the society is becoming more and more hollow, and the society\nitself more and more corrupted…. Many social scientists claim that\npremarital sexual relations were not unusual among both young men and\nyoung women before 1960’s. But what is different today is the open\nacceptance by many young people of a single standard for both sexes\nbefore marriage. Some Americans say this is only casual behavior;\nothers may find such an excuse that premarital relations are the natural\nresult of romantic love. This sounds even more ridiculous. The “new\nmorality” is nothing but “immorality.” This is the so-called “American\ncivilization.”\nHomosexuality is a rather strange social phenomenon that most people\ncan hardly understand. It widely spreads. One reason for this may be the\ndespair in marriage or love affairs. Some people fail in marriage and\nbecome disappointed with it. So they decide no longer to love the\nopposite sex, but instead begin to love a person of the same sex as a\nreturn of hatred to the opposite. Another reason may be that some people\njust want to find and do something “new” and “curious,” as the\nAmericans are known as adventurous. So they practised homosexuality\nas a kind of new excitement. Through this, we can see clearly the\nspiritual hollowness of these people and the distortion of the social\norder.\nThe chapter outlined a number of additional problems—racism, sexism,\ndrugs, religious fanaticism—and then it gave the fundamental reason for\nAmerica’s flaws:\nHowever, the most important reason is the capitalist system of\nAmerica. In this capitalist society, although science and technology is\nhighly advanced, some people are suffering from spiritual hollowness.",
        "Thus they start to look for things curious and exciting. Therefore, only\nwhen the American capitalist system is ended, can all these social\nproblems be solved.\nIt was not an easy book to teach from. The biggest problem was\nseparating the wheat from the chaff: it was important to tell the students that\nthings like racism and sexism were indeed major problems in America, but at\nthe same time they needed to know that for many people homosexuality was\nnot an issue (and it was also good if they realized that Capitalism does not\ncause homosexuality). In the students’ minds, though, the book was either\ncorrect or it was wrong. There was no middle ground, and they had been\ntaught not to question official texts.\nTeaching as a foreigner was a matter of trying to negotiate your way\nthrough this political landscape. It was an acquired skill—over time, Adam\nand I gradually learned how to minimize the politics, to find subjects and\nways to approach them that didn’t trigger the standard knee-jerk reactions. It\nwas easier for me in literature class, especially when we started working on\npoetry, which simplified everything.\nBy rights it shouldn’t have been simple—the first poem we studied was\nShakespeare’s, and I didn’t make it particularly easy. I defined the form of a\nShakespearean sonnet and gave them Sonnet Eighteen in pieces, broken apart\nline by line. We reviewed poetic terms and archaic language, and I divided\nthem into groups and told them to put the poem in order. Even though I gave\nthem the first line, I figured it was an impossible task; my goal was simply to\nmake them struggle with the bare bones of the poem until its form felt\nsomewhat familiar. But they were never suspicious of impossible tasks,\nwhich was part of what made it so easy to teach in Fuling. The students\nwould work at anything without complaint, probably because they knew that\neven the most difficult literature assignment was preferable to wading knee-\ndeep in muck behind a water buffalo. And so the groups studied their broken\nsonnets while I gazed out at the sampans and barges on the Wu River.\nWithin an hour they had it. Some of the groups were merely close, but in\neach class there were two or three who nailed it:",
        "Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?\nThou art more lovely and more temperate.\nRough winds do shake the darling buds of May,\nAnd summer’s lease hath all too short a date.\nSometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,\nAnd often is his gold complexion dimmed;\nAnd every fair from fair sometimes declines,\nBy chance, or nature’s changing course, untrimmed;\nBut thy eternal summer shall not fade,\nNor lose possession of that fair thou ow’st,\nNor shall Death brag thou wand’rest in his shade,\nWhen in eternal lines to time thou grow’st.\nSo long as men can breathe or eyes can see,\nSo long lives this, and this gives life to thee.\nAnd they understood the form of the poem; just as they had put it\ntogether, they could take it apart. They could scan its rhythm—they knew\nwhere the stresses were in each line, and they could find the inconsistencies.\nThey read the poem to themselves and softly beat time on their desks. They\nheard the sonnet. This was something that few American students could do,\nat least in my experience. We didn’t read enough poetry to recognize its\nmusic, a skill that educated people lost long ago. But my students in Fuling\nstill had it—nothing had touched that ability, not the advent of television or\neven the pointed devastation of the Cultural Revolution.\nAs time went on it almost depressed me. The Chinese had spent years\ndeliberately and diligently destroying every valuable aspect of their\ntraditional culture, and yet with regard to enjoying poetry Americans had\narguably done a much better job of finishing ours off. How many Americans\ncould recite a poem, or identify its rhythm? Every one of my Fuling students\ncould recite at least a dozen Chinese classics by heart—the verses of Du Fu,\nof Li Bai, of Qu Yuan—and these were young men and women from the\ncountryside of Sichuan province, a backwater by Chinese standards. They\nstill read books and they still read poetry; that was the difference.\nVerse never seemed to bore or frustrate them. The only stumbling block\nwas language, the new vocabulary and the English archaisms, and with these",
        "they had infinite patience. We reviewed Sonnet Eighteen carefully, until at\nlast we distilled it to the notion of poetic immortality, and I asked them: Was\nShakespeare successful? Did the woman live forever? Some of them shook\ntheir heads—it was four hundred years ago, after all—but others hesitated. I\nasked them where the woman had lived.\n“England,” said Armstrong, who answered most of my questions.\n“And when was that?”\n“Around 1600.”\n“Think about this,” I said. “Four centuries ago, Shakespeare loved a\nwoman and wrote a poem about her. He said he would make her beauty live\nforever—that was his promise. Today the year is 1996, and we are in China,\nin Sichuan, next to the Yangtze River. Shakespeare never came to Fuling.\nNone of you has ever been to England, and you have not seen the woman that\nShakespeare loved four hundred years ago. But right now every one of you is\nthinking about her.”\nThere was absolute silence. Usually Fuling was a riot of horns and\nconstruction projects, but at that moment in that classroom it was completely\nquiet. There was respect and awe in that silence, and I shared it. I had read\nthe poem countless times, but I had never heard it truly until I stood in front\nof my class in Fuling and listened to their stillness as they considered the\nmiracle of those fourteen lines.\nA moment later I asked them to describe what they saw in that silence,\nShakespeare’s woman through Chinese eyes:\nHer skin is as white as snow and as smooth as ice. Her long hair is like\nwaterfall; her eyes are so attractive you will never forget after you see\nher. She is plentiful, she is tall. Her little mouth as red as roses, and her\neyebrow is like the leaves of willow. Her fingers are so slender that\nscallions can’t compare with them.\nShe looks like a slim and graceful lotus that is beginning to blossom.\nHer long hair is like a waterfall. Her elbow is like a crescent moon. Her\nmouth is like a red cherry. She has bright eyes. She is as gentle as water.",
        "She is slim, with long black hair. Her eyes are big and bright, full of\nsoft and shyness. Her brows are like two leaves of willow. Her lips seem\nvery active. Her skin is white and soft, like cooked fat.\nHer hair is just like golden wave. Her skin is so smooth that you will\nsuspect it is made of marble. Her waist is as soft as watergrass and her\nfingers are slim as the root of onion.\nShe has natural, plain beauty as a woman in the countryside. She is as\npure as crystal. She looks like a floating poem.\nIn our imagination, she is very beautiful and have something of\nmelancholy. In Chinese history, there are four beauties, maybe, she\nlooks like one of them—Wang Zhaojun. For us, we can’t find some\ndescription about their beauty, because their beauty is beyond\ndescription. We can only say: they are very beautiful.\nTHERE WAS AN INTENSITY and a freshness to their readings that I’d\nnever seen before from any other students of literature, and partly it was a\nmatter of studying foreign material. We were exchanging clichés without\nknowing it: I had no idea that classical Chinese poetry routinely makes\nscallions of women’s fingers, and they had no idea that Sonnet Eighteen’s\npoetic immortality had been reviewed so many times that it nearly died, a\npoem with a number tagged to its toe. Our exchange suddenly made\neverything new: there were no dull poems, no overworked plays, no",
        "characters who had already been discussed to the point of clinicism. Nobody\ngroaned when I assigned Beowulf—as far as they were concerned, it was just\na good monster story.\nThis was the core of what we studied in that cramped classroom, and on\nthe good days we never left. But there was always a great deal that\nsurrounded us: the campus and its rules, the country and its politics. These\nforces were always present, hovering somewhere outside the classroom, and\nit reached the point where I could almost feel the moments when they pressed\nagainst us, when some trigger was touched and suddenly the Party interfered.\nOccasionally students wrote about how Shakespeare represented the\nProletariat as he criticized English Capitalism (because of this theory, many\nChinese are familiar with The Merchant of Venice), and several pointed out\nthat Hamlet is a great character because he cares deeply about the peasantry.\nOther students told me that the peasants in A Midsummer Night’s Dream are\nthe most powerful figures in the play, because all power comes from the\nProletariat, which is how Revolution starts.\nI had mixed reactions to such comments. It was good to see my students\ninteracting with the text, but I was less enthusiastic about Shakespeare being\nrecruited for Communist Party propaganda. I found myself resisting these\ninterpretations, albeit carefully—in light of my students’ backgrounds, I\ncouldn’t bluntly say that the peasants in A Midsummer Night’s Dream are\npowerless buffoons who provide comic relief. But one way or another I\nalways tried to answer the readings that I felt were misguided. I argued that\nHamlet is a great character not because he cares deeply about the peasantry,\nbut rather because he cares deeply and eloquently about himself; and I\npointed out that Shakespeare was a Petty Bourgeois Capitalist who made his\nfortune by acquiring stock in a theater company.\nFor the first time I came to understand why literature so often slides away\ntoward politics. I had struggled with this before; at Princeton I had majored in\nEnglish, and after graduation I had spent two years studying English\nlanguage and literature at Oxford. My original plan had been to become a\nprofessor of literature, but over time I became less enamored of what I saw in\nEnglish departments, especially in America. Part of it was simply aesthetics\n—I found that I couldn’t read literary criticism, because its academic stiffness\nwas so far removed from the grace of good writing. And I could make very\nlittle sense of most criticism, which seemed a hopeless mess of awkward",
        "words: Deconstructionism, Post-Modernism, New Historicism. None of it\ncould be explained simply and clearly—just as my Fuling students stumbled\nwhen asked to define Historical Materialism or Socialism with Chinese\nCharacteristics.\nBut mostly I was disturbed by the politicization of literature in the West:\nthe way that literature was read as social commentary rather than art, and the\nway that books were forced to serve political theories of one stripe or\nanother. Very rarely did a critic seem to react to a text; rather the text was\ntwisted so that it reacted neatly to whatever ideas the critic held sacred. There\nwere Marxist critics, Feminist critics, and Post-Colonial critics; and almost\ninvariably they wielded their theories like molds, forcing books inside and\nsqueezing out a neatly-shaped product. Marxists turned out Marxism;\nFeminists turned out Feminism; Post-Colonialists turned out Post-\nColonialism. It was like reading the same senseless book over and over again.\nAnd I resented the way that English departments constantly tinkered with\nthe canon, hoping to create a book list as multicultural as the fake\nphotographs they put on the covers of their undergraduate brochures. It had\nalways seemed to me that with regard to literature there was some value in\nestablishing and respecting a cultural foundation, and now in China I saw\nwhat happened when these roots were completely ripped up. For years the\nChinese had mined literature for its social value, especially during the\nCultural Revolution, when all operas were banned except for a handful of\npolitical works like The Red Detachment of Women. Even today there was\nmuch that had been lost. All of my students knew Marx; none of them knew\nConfucius.\nBut at the same time I came to see the reason for such politicization in a\nmore human light. I realized that part of the power of great literature is its\nuniversality: the daughter of Sichuanese peasants can read Beowulf and make\nconnections to her own life, and a classroom of Chinese students can listen to\na Shakespeare sonnet and see the flawless features of a Tang Dynasty beauty.\nBut along with this power there is a fragility, because it is always tempting to\nmisappropriate the force of a great writer. It’s natural to want Shakespeare on\nyour side—and if he doesn’t fit perfectly, you can twist his words to serve\nyour purpose. Or, if he absolutely refuses to come to heel, you can expel him\nfrom the canon.\nAll of this was commonly done in China, and yet I was surprised to find",
        "that in some ways my students did a better job of avoiding politics than\nstudents at Princeton and Oxford. As the semester went on, the political\nforces outside the classroom seemed to drift farther and farther away,\nprobably because the material was foreign. The literature was so fresh and\ndifferent that the students usually forgot their standard political guidelines,\nand we also skirted the hassles of English departments in America. None of\nmy students seemed to care that in the fall semester we read strictly dead\nwhite males, just as they didn’t care that a live white male taught the class.\nAs far as they were concerned, all of us were simply waiguoren.\nInstead of worrying about politics, their energy was focused on\nunderstanding the material. They listened to the way the poetry sounded, and\nthey weighed the characters in the stories. They took this seriously—to them,\nliterature wasn’t simply a game, and its figures were like real people who\nshould be judged accordingly. They studied a summary of Hamlet, and after\nreading it a student named Lily responded in her journal:\nMr. Hessler, do you like Hamlet? I don’t admire him and I dislike\nhim. I think he is too sensitive and conservative and selfish. He should\ntell the truth to his dear, Ophelia, and ask her to face and solve the\nproblem together. After all, two lovers should share wealth and woe.\nWhat’s more, I dislike his hesitation. As a man he should do what he\nwants to do resolutely.\nYou couldn’t have said something like that at Oxford. You couldn’t\nsimply say: I don’t like Hamlet because I think he’s a lousy person.\nEverything had to be more clever than that; you had to recognize Hamlet as a\ncharacter in a text, and then you had to dismantle it accordingly, layer by\nlayer, not just the play itself but everything that had ever been written about\nit. You had to consider what all the other critics had said, and the\naccumulated weight of their knowledge and nonsense sat heavily on the play.\nYou had to think about how the play tied in with current events and trends.\nThis process had some value, of course, but for many readers it seemed to\nhave reached the point where there wasn’t even a split-second break before\nthe sophistication started. As a student, that was all I had wanted—a brief",
        "moment when a simple and true thought flashed across the mind: I don’t like\nthis character. This is a good story. The woman in this poem is beautiful and I\nbet her fingers are slim like scallions.\nThis was what I was looking for as a student—some sign that literature\nwas still enjoyable, that people read for pleasure and that this was important\nin and of itself, apart from the politics; but often it was hard to tell if this was\nhappening. In Fuling, however, there was no question that the students\nenjoyed what they read, and I realized that for the rest of my life I would try\nto think of literature as they saw it. Sometimes, when they were working on\nan assignment and I was looking out at the Wu River, I’d smile and think to\nmyself: We’re all refugees here. They’ve escaped from their classes on\nBuilding Chinese Socialism, and I’ve escaped from Deconstructionism. We\nwere happy, reading poetry while out on the rivers all of Fuling went about\nits business.\nWE STUDIED HAMLET IN OCTOBER, when the weather was still warm\nbut the autumn rains were beginning to settle in the river valley. I divided my\nclasses into eleven groups and they spent a day preparing their scenes, and\nthen they performed the play in the classroom. They pushed the teacher’s\npodium to the side of the room and swept the floor, which was the stage. All\nof the students crowded their stools and desks into the back and from there\nthey watched.\nActing transformed them entirely—in class they could be painfully shy,\nbut drama changed all of that. Every gesture was overblown, every emotion\noverdone; they were incorrigible overactors, and after growing accustomed to\ntheir shyness it was strange to watch them shout and cry on the bare stage of\nthe classroom. Sometimes I thought that perhaps it had something to do with\nthe influence of traditional Chinese opera, in which the action is exaggerated\nand stylized, but more likely it was simply a release in a society where\nemotions were rarely open. Regardless, it was a strange experience to watch\nthem perform; they were half-recognizable, like the play itself, and both the\nstudents and Hamlet became something new in my eyes.\nRoger played the dead king’s ghost, a writhing, howling spirit in a\nbrightly painted cone-shaped Chinese emperor’s crown that he had made of",
        "papier mâché. In any performance of Hamlet it is the ghost that sets the tone\nfor the play, and so it was with Roger in his imperial crown—a touch of\nChina in the class’s Denmark.\nIn the second scene, Hamlet went before Gertrude and Claudius, who\nwere played by Jane and Sally. Romance was always a knotty issue for my\nstudents; even the most casual public contact between sexes was taboo, and\nto play a wife or a girlfriend was too embarrassing for most of the female\nstudents. Often they simplified it the way Jane and Sally did, by making the\ncouple the same sex, because in Fuling it was common for friends to be\nopenly affectionate with each other. And so Sally stroked Jane’s hair, and\nJane fondled the other girl’s arm, and then, realizing that Hamlet was glaring\nat them, Sally said imperiously,\nHow is it that the clouds still hang on you?\nAnd Hamlet—played by Barber, a nervous misnamed boy in thick glasses\nand a cheap tan suit—replied,\nNot so, my lord. I am too much in the sun.\nJane ran her hand along Sally’s thigh. Both of them were pretty girls,\ntheir long hair brushed smooth like black silk. Barber scowled. Languidly\nJane pressed close against Sally, and then she purred,\nGood Hamlet, cast thy nighted color off,\nAnd let thine eye look like a friend on Denmark.\nDon’t continue to be sad for your father,\nYou know that every man must die.\nThey wrote most of the dialogue themselves—the language of the play\nwas too difficult and they used only the most famous lines, writing the rest in\ncolloquial speech. Hamlet’s Act III soliloquy was performed by Soddy, the",
        "class monitor, who stood alone in front of the class and said,\nTo be, or not to be: that is the question:\nWhether it’s better to do nothing and suffer,\nOr whether I should struggle against Claudius\nAnd end these troubles. To die, to sleep—\nNo more—and by sleeping to end all of\nThese terrible problems! To die, to sleep—\nTo sleep—perchance to dream: ay, there’s the rub….\nHe was a big kid with a lazy eye from the countryside of northern\nSichuan, and the other students called him Lao Da—Big Brother, a nickname\nfrom Hong Kong gangster films, a term of respect that reflected Soddy’s\nauthority. But despite his high position in the class hierarchy, he was a\nrelatively poor student. His writing was fine, but his spoken English was bad\nand he had no confidence in class. Rarely did he speak out or answer\nquestions.\nI had never understood why the students respected Soddy so much until\nthe day he stood in front of us and played Hamlet. His English was still poor\n—he stumbled over the soliloquy, and some of it was unintelligible. But that\ndidn’t matter, because now his talent was suddenly palpable; it was as if he\nhad reached out and caught hold of his gift in the palm of his hand, turning it\nover once or twice, holding it as surely as he held our attention. He was slow,\ndeliberate. He paced the room, and in his movements there were traces of\nSichuan opera—a cloak folded just so over the crook of his arm; a wooden\nstool laid on its side and used as the focus of his wanderings, until he made a\npalace of that simple prop. But mostly his voice was perfect—he controlled\nthe pace and tone of his speech, the way Hamlet’s emotions rise and ebb like\na hot uncertain sea. And Soddy knew how to use both noise and silence, to\nshout in frustration and then let the words resound in the classroom that he\ncleaned every week. He paced restlessly; he crouched on the stool; he buried\nhis head in his hands; he roared and shouted; he kicked at the chair; and\nsuddenly he was silent—and then, after the silence was complete, he said,\nquietly,",
        "Thus conscience does make cowards of us all,\nAnd thus we want to do something\nBut our thoughts prevent us\nAnd lose the name of action—\nHe was Hamlet and he was Lao Da; there was no longer any question in\nmy mind. The students watched with rapt attention and at the end they\napplauded madly. For the rest of the year, whenever I looked at Soddy, at his\nsquare jaw and his cockeyed gaze and his dark peasant’s complexion, I saw\nthe Prince of Denmark. That was exactly what Hamlet would have looked\nlike in the countryside of Sichuan province.\nIN THE OTHER CLASS’S PERFORMANCE, Rosencrantz and\nGuildenstern marched before the king, kowtowed until their foreheads nearly\ngrazed the floor, and stood there holding hands while they listened to\nClaudius’s instructions. In Sichuan it was common for male friends to hold\nhands like that—and certainly you would want to hold somebody’s hand if\nyou were being sent off unknowingly to your death.\nThey loved the characters of Rosencrantz and Guildenstern. Some of\nthem were annoyed by Hamlet, and they found Ophelia pathetic, but\neverybody loved Rosencrantz and Guildenstern. They loved their hapless\nprying and they loved their demise, the way the servants are tricked into\ncarrying their own death warrants to the King of England. That was a good\ntouch by Shakespeare—another bit of China in the Bard’s Denmark. It was a\nlittle like Miao Ze in the Chinese classic The Romance of the Three\nKingdoms, who betrays his brother-in-law Ma Teng in order to win the graces\nof the powerful Cao Cao. But Cao Cao, after killing Ma Teng, turns to the\nexpectant Miao Ze and says, “A man so faithless does not deserve to live,”\nand promptly executes him and his entire family in the public square. Or\nmaybe it was like Mao’s general Lin Biao, who had tried to turn the Cultural\nRevolution to his purposes but in the end became one of its victims. In any\ncase, my students knew Rosencrantz and Guildenstern—they had seen those\ncharacters many times in many ages. Even today you could sometimes still",
        "find them in the cadres’ offices.\nThe play ended in a flurry of swordplay and kung-fu kicks, Laertes and\nHamlet and Claudius involved in what could have been the climax of a Hong\nKong martial arts film, until at the end only Hamlet and Horatio crouched in\nfront of the class. They were played by Vic and Lazy, both of them dressed in\ncheap Western-style suits, and before their scene they carefully spread\nnewspaper across the floor so the Prince could die without getting dirty. The\nclass giggled—but then the scene began, and Lazy leaned against the wall\nand held the dying Hamlet, and everybody hushed.\nLazy cradled him close, like a child, and yet the contact was natural\nbecause Chinese men were allowed to touch each other in that way. Hamlet\ngroaned, tried to speak, coughed out his dying words; Horatio stammered\nfarewell and rocked his friend tenderly in his arms. The class was silent,\nwatching. The actors were small men and alone on the floor they looked even\nsmaller, crouched below the peeling paint and the dusty blackboard. Hamlet\ncoughed again and said,\nI cannot live to hear the news from England,\nBut I support Fortinbras. He has my dying voice.\nSo tell him that—the rest is silence.\nAnd so Hamlet died—and for a moment I almost forgot that I was in a\ncheerless Chinese classroom, and that Horatio was in fact a peasant’s son\nwho liked to sleep and called himself Lazy, holding Hamlet tenderly and\nsaying softly, sadly, Lazily,\nGood night, sweet prince,\nAnd flights of angels sing thee to thy rest.\nTHE LATE-AUTUMN MISTS fell over White Flat Mountain and the\nclassrooms grew colder. They weren’t heated—few public buildings in\nFuling were—and finally I took to closing the door when I taught. The\nstudents started wearing coats, scarves, gloves; their fingers swelled with",
        "chilblains and their ears turned red. I could see their breath in the cold\ncrowded room. We read Swift, Wordsworth, Byron. The verses resounded\nwith sweet regularity as we recited them aloud—iambic puffs of steam rising\ntoward the ceiling. Outside, the unmetered wind blew hard from the Yangtze.\nBeneath their desks the students stamped their feet in the cold.\nThey begged me to assign another Shakespeare play, and at last I did,\npartly to keep warm. I summarized Romeo and Juliet and they played it.\nSoddy and his classmates built a balcony out of desks, an unstable tower\nupon which Lucy stood bravely while Soddy courted her from below. Five\nscenes later, Grace gave Juliet’s soliloquy as she prepared to take the Friar’s\nsleeping potion. Her family was against her, and Romeo had been exiled, and\nin the middle of the scene Grace began to cry. She was a beautiful, lively girl,\none of my favorite students because she always spoke her mind without fear\nof embarrassment. Chinese girls weren’t supposed to be like that—but Grace\ndidn’t care. On the day she played Juliet her long black hair was pulled back\nsmooth past her shoulders, and her eyes shone bright with tears, and her\nbreath came out white in the cold classroom.\nA few days earlier, when they had been preparing the play, I had noticed\none boy standing apart from his group. His English name was Silence Hill. “I\nam always silent,” he had explained back in September, when I first asked\nhim about his name. But he wrote beautifully, a thoughtful young man from a\nvillage of 250 people, and he always had a soft smile on his worn face. On\nthe day that I noticed him standing alone, he was smiling and staring fixedly\nat the text of the play. I asked him what he was looking at, and without a\nword he pointed at two of Juliet’s lines:\nMy only love, sprung from my only hate!\nToo early seen unknown, and known too late!\n“Do you understand what that means?” I asked, thinking he had a\nquestion.\n“Yes,” he said. “I think it’s very beautiful.”\nI paused and looked at the lines again.\n“I think you’re right,” I said, and for a moment neither of us said",
        "anything. Together Silence Hill and I stood there looking at the poetry.",
        "RAISE THE FLAG MOUNTAIN\nTHE MOUNTAIN HAS TWO NAMES, Peach Blossom Mountain and\nRaise the Flag Mountain, and it rises green above the college and the junction\nof the rivers. In spring and fall and winter, the peak often fades into the river-\nvalley fog, and in summer, when the days burn bright under a violent sun, the\ngroves of peach trees near the summit seem to shiver in the heat.\nThe blossoms appear in late March or early April, two brief pink-\nflowered weeks that give the mountain its first name. But almost nobody in\nFuling calls it Peach Blossom Mountain, although the origins of the other title\nare even more fleeting—a single instant during the nineteenth-century\nTaiping Rebellion, when China’s history came to Fuling, marched up the\nmountain, and then moved on. This was perhaps the only time when Fuling\nwas close to the center of China’s affairs, and after more than a century the\necho still remains, the mountain’s name a memorial to a strange and violent\nrevolution.\nThe Great Taiping Rebellion was started in the mid-1840s by Hong\nXiuquan, a poor man from Guangxi province who, frustrated by failing the\nChinese civil service examination four times, decided that he was the Son of\nGod and the younger brother of Jesus Christ. After that, things happened very\nquickly. By 1851, Hong Xiuquan was leading twenty thousand armed\nfollowers, and he declared that he was the Heavenly King of a new dynasty.\nHis soldiers let their hair grow long, fought without fear of death, and\nbelieved a sort of bastardized fundamentalist Protestantism that was based\nloosely on foreign missionary tracts. In 1853, they captured the eastern city\nof Nanjing, calling it their New Jerusalem, and in time Hong Xiuquan ruled\nalmost half of China.\nThe Heavenly Kingdom of Great Peace—Taiping Tianguo—was opposed\nto opium, foot binding, prostitution, gambling, and tobacco, and it had some\nsupport from the Chinese peasants, who had no affection for the corrupt Qing",
        "Dynasty rulers. But Hong Xiuquan and the other revolutionary leaders lacked\nthe vision and experience to run a country, and power tempted most of them\ninto luxury and infighting. They began to acquire the trappings of the dynasty\nthey hoped to overthrow: robes of yellow silk, hordes of sycophants, endless\nconcubines. But they were still too powerful to be defeated by the Qing, and\nthe Taipings held Nanjing even while engaging in increasingly bloody\ninternecine power struggles.\nHong Xiuquan’s greatest general was Shi Dakai, who was known as the\nWing King, Lord of Five Thousand Years. Of all the original leaders, he was\nthe most capable, and his disillusionment with the Taiping infighting finally\npushed him to leave Nanjing in 1857. Leading 100,000 soldiers, he embarked\non a military campaign that spanned six years and foreshadowed the\nsweeping troop movements of the Communist Long March. His Taiping\narmy zigzagged across eastern and southern China, arriving eventually at the\nYangtze River valley. In time they came to Fuling, where Shi Dakai and his\nsoldiers marched up the long even slope of Peach Blossom Mountain, and\nthere, at the summit, they raised the flag of the Heavenly Kingdom.\nFROM THE SUMMIT of Raise the Flag Mountain, all of Fuling can be\nseen on a clear day. But in the fall, when the seasonal rains and mists sit\nheavy above the rivers, there are days when the view is blocked by clouds,\nand the city across the Wu is nothing but sound: horns and motors and\nconstruction projects echoing up through the heavy white fog. Sometimes the\nmist will stay for days or even weeks. But then something clears the valleys\n—a shift in temperature, a stiff breeze—and suddenly the view opens.\nSouthward the mountain falls away steeply to valleys of terraced\ncropland, and near the Wu River the land is broken by the settlements of the\nEast River district: the college, looking small with the distance; the ceramics\nfactory, its stacks spewing yellow dust into the air; the long concrete pier and\nthe old ferries that traverse the Wu. The river lies slack, like a long thin bolt\nof gray silk unrolled between the hills.\nIn the mist the city looks dirty and old, its buildings flung carelessly\nacross the hills, and it also looks big. Seen from ground level it is impossible\nto gain perspective on Fuling’s size, but from Raise the Flag Mountain the",
        "scale of the city is suddenly apparent. The gray buildings are piled off far into\nthe horizon, past the distant needlelike spire of the Monument to the\nRevolutionary Martyrs. And yet by Chinese standards it is a small city—a\ntown, really—and all around the jumbled buildings the mountains are green\nand impressive.\nBut none of them is truly wild. The view from Raise the Flag Mountain\nextends for perhaps six miles in every direction, and in that range nearly\nevery inch of useful soil is under cultivation. The same is true for the\nmountain itself: the peak is an orchard, a garden, an enormous farm lying on\nits side, the slope broken into steps and terraces that turn the hillside into\nlevel land.\nPeach and orange groves are planted along the summit, where the\nmountain is too steep for terracing. A bit lower, the slope decreases and the\npeasants have carved the land into short shelves for vegetables—cabbage,\npotatoes, soybeans, radishes. Even lower, the terraces broaden enough for\ngrain crops, and now in the fall it is almost time to plant the winter wheat.\nThe peasants will sow the crop in November and December, and between\nevery two or three rows they will leave a space of two feet. In March, two\nmonths before the wheat is harvested, they will plant corn in the spaces\nbetween the rows. No land is wasted, and nothing is rushed or delayed;\neverything has its season, and every season rests on the simple work that the\npeasants do with their hands.\nFarther down the mountain, the rice paddies were harvested weeks ago;\nnow the fields are dry, and yellow stubble pokes up from the dirt. Most of the\npaddies sit in the low valley of the mountain’s southern flank, where the land\nflattens enough to be shaped into broad sweeping terraces that can hold\nwater. Of all the mountain’s crops, rice has the most intricate routines. It is\nsowed in March, planted densely in seedbeds, and then the following month\nthe green shoots are uprooted and moved by hand to flooded paddies. In July\nand August, the crop is harvested and threshed, and the dry paddy can be\nused for vegetables or winter wheat. And so the cycle continues, season after\nseason, year after year, and sometimes a single plot of land will see a full\nyear’s crops: rice to vegetables, vegetables to wheat, wheat to rice once more.\nThe lower mountain is cut by a dusty road near the Wu River. Below the\nroad, the hillside falls away steeply, but even this floodland is used for winter\npotatoes and mustard tuber. The small plots continue all the way to the rocky",
        "banks of the Wu, where an old rusted boat approaches the junction of the\nrivers. The craft’s low front deck is empty of cargo, and from the cabin\nflutters a red Chinese flag. The boat reaches the Yangtze, spinning to face the\nriver’s flow. Its motor wheezes. For an instant it pauses, fixed by the current\n—below the mountain, in front of the city, caught in the junction of the two\nrivers. Then the propeller catches hold of the fast-moving Yangtze and the\nboat putters upstream.\nSHI DAKAI AND HIS MEN followed the river valley west from Fuling.\nThey marched past Chongqing and Luzhou, and then they left the Yangtze\nand entered the mountains of western Sichuan. By now it had been years\nsince the march began, and in Nanjing the Heavenly Kingdom was in\nshambles, and finally the brave expedition became a retreat.\nThe army followed the banks of the Dadu, a mountain river in western\nSichuan whose water runs green with glacial melt. The river had seen great\nbattles before—critical campaigns were pitched there in the Three Kingdoms\nPeriod, sixteen centuries earlier. And now the Qing government forces were\nin close pursuit, hoping to trap Shi Dakai and his men in the narrow valleys.\nThe year was 1863.\nThey paused for three days on the banks of the river to mark the birth of\nShi Dakai’s son. The rituals were elaborate, because the boy was a prince in\nthe Heavenly Kingdom—the son of the Wing King, the Lightning of the Holy\nSpirit, the Lord of Five Thousand Years. But the Heavenly Kingdom was\nalready fading into history, and Shi Dakai’s five thousand years would be cut\nshort. The delay at the Dadu proved fatal; the Qing army cornered the rebels,\nand Shi Dakai surrendered after making sure that his five wives and children\nhad been put to death as painlessly as possible. He begged his captors to\nexecute him instead of his faithful followers, whose ranks had already shrunk\nfrom the original 100,000 to two thousand men. The Qing commanders\nlistened patiently to Shi Dakai’s request, and then they massacred the Taiping\ntroops and dismembered the Wing King, slowly.\nSeventy-two years later, Mao Zedong led his Communist forces to the\nsame river during the heart of the Long March. The Kuomintang was on the\nverge of destroying the Red Army, and the lessons of history taught Mao not",
        "to delay. His troops moved steadily northward, until at Luding they came to\nan ancient iron bridge across the Dadu that was well defended by\nKuomintang forces. The situation appeared hopeless.\nThirty Red soldiers volunteered. Under machine-gun fire they crawled\nacross the bridge, hand over hand, iron link by iron link, and against all odds\nthey succeeded in capturing the enemy gun nests. The entire Communist\narmy crossed the river victoriously, having survived what turned out to be the\nmost critical battle of the Long March. Later that year, eight thousand of\nMao’s men, all that remained from an initial force of eighty thousand,\nfinished their trek in northern Shaanxi province. They established a base and\nsteadily grew in power, conquering the nation village by village, province by\nprovince; and in every town they spread their doctrine, which was a sort of\nbastardized Marxism based loosely on the Soviet model. Fourteen years later,\nin 1949, Mao Zedong established the People’s Republic of China.\nThe Communists opposed opium, foot binding, prostitution, and\ngambling, and they had a great deal of support from the Chinese peasants,\nwho had no affection for the grasping landlords and the corruption of the\nKuomintang. But Mao lacked the vision and experience necessary to run a\ncountry effectively, and power inspired him to build a cult of state-worship\naround his image. The leading cadres began to acquire the luxurious\ntrappings of the corrupt reign they had over-thrown: great mansions, hordes\nof sycophants, endless concubines.\nBut even in the late 1990s, as stories of corruption are rife and the\ncountry’s economy quickly privatizes, the official view of history holds\nsteady. The Communist vision of the past idealizes peasant revolts like the\nGreat Taiping Rebellion, until even a remote place like Fuling has a stone\nstatue of Shi Dakai in the public park. Some aspects of the movement, in\ncontrast, have been allowed to fade—Chinese history books say little about\nthe Taipings’ strange brand of Christianity, and many students in a place like\nFuling don’t know that Hong Xiuquan believed himself to be the younger\nbrother of Jesus Christ. But students know that he was a peasant\nrevolutionary, and that Mao succeeded where Hong Xiuquan failed. Such\nechoes are seen as evidence of legitimacy rather than signs that Chinese\nhistory, like the land, sometimes follows a pattern of cycles.\nThe Dadu River runs south to Leshan, where it enters the Min River\nunder the sightless gaze of the largest carved Buddha in the world. The Min",
        "flows southwest to Yibin, where it enters the Yangtze, and from there the\nriver runs west and north for three hundred miles until it passes the green\nterraced slopes of Raise the Flag Mountain. Today there is no flag on the\nrounded peak. The two-named mountain looms large above the river, its solid\nbulk recalling the words that the Sichuan poet Du Fu wrote more than a\nthousand years ago:\nThe state is shattered;\nMountains and rivers remain.",
        "CHAPTER THREE",
        "Running\nIN THE MORNINGS I often ran to the summit of Raise the Flag Mountain.\nAs I ran, I studied the propaganda signs along the route, although at the\nbeginning there wasn’t much about them that was recognizable. There were\nthree signs on the road out to the mountain, and to me they looked like this:\nI finished my runs back in the center of campus, not far from the teaching\nbuilding, where a stone wall served as a backdrop for an inscription of three-\nfoot-high characters:\nThat was how Chinese appeared in my first few months. I arrived in\nFuling able to recognize about forty characters, all of them simple: people,\nmiddle, country, above, below, long, man, woman. There hadn’t been time\nfor more; the Peace Corps had given us an intensive course during our two\nmonths of training in Chengdu, but the emphasis was on learning enough\nspoken Mandarin to function. We had to study written Chinese on our own,\nand until I got to Fuling I simply hadn’t had enough time.\nI came to Sichuan because I wanted to teach, but I also had two other\nmotivations: I thought the experience would make me a better writer, and I\nwanted to learn Chinese. These were very clear goals, but the way to achieve",
        "them was much less obvious. I hoped the writing would take care of itself—I\nwould keep my eyes open and take notes, and eventually, when I felt I was\nready, I would start to write. But Chinese was a different matter altogether\nand I had never undertaken something like that before.\nThat was one reason I had decided to come to China with the Peace\nCorps, because I knew they would try to teach me the language. Their\nChengdu training course had been excellent; the classes were small and the\nteachers experienced, and it had been easy to make progress. In Fuling,\nthough, language study was my own affair. The Peace Corps would pay for\ntutors, but I had to find them myself, and I had to decide which textbooks I\nwould use and how I would structure my studies. It was a daunting task—\nessentially, I had to figure out how to learn Chinese.\nFor the first few weeks, Dean Fu searched for tutors who could help\nAdam and me. He was as lost as we were—he had never known a foreigner\nwho was trying to learn the language, and I suspected that secretly he felt the\nproject was hopeless. Waiguoren couldn’t learn Chinese—everybody in\nFuling knew that. Our students found it hilarious that we even tried. They\nwould ask me to speak a little Chinese, or write a character or two, and then\nthey would laugh at my efforts. At first this didn’t bother me, but quickly it\nbecame annoying. They thought I was dabbling in the language when in fact I\nwas serious: I knew that studying Chinese was one of the most important\nthings I could do in Fuling. So much depended on knowing the language—\nmy friendships, my ability to function in the city, my understanding of the\nplace.\nI also wanted to learn Chinese out of stubbornness, because as a\nwaiguoren you weren’t expected to do that. Such low expectations had a long\ntradition; even as late as the early 1800s it had been illegal for a Chinese to\nteach the language to foreigners, and a number of Chinese were imprisoned\nand even executed for tutoring young Englishmen. This bit of history\nfascinated me: how many languages had been sacred and forbidden to\noutsiders? Certainly, those laws had been changed more than a century ago,\nbut China was still ambivalent about opening to the outside world and\nlanguage was still at the heart of this issue. In good conscience I could not\nlive there for two years and not learn to speak Chinese. To me, this was as\nimportant as fulfilling my obligations as a teacher.\nBut this need wasn’t nearly as obvious to everybody else. Dean Fu took a",
        "long time finding tutors, and perhaps he was hoping that we’d forget about it.\nWe didn’t need Chinese to teach, after all, and we already knew enough to\nbuy groceries and eat at local restaurants. That should be adequate, people\nfigured. In some respects, we were seen as English-teaching machines, or\nperhaps farm animals—expensive and skittish draft horses that taught\nliterature and culture. We were given cadres’ apartments, and we had our\nown Changhong-brand color televisions with remote. Our bedrooms were air-\nconditioned. Each of us had a good kitchen and two beautiful balconies. Our\nstudents were obedient and respectful. It didn’t matter that, even as we were\ngiven all of these things, the leaders also gave quiet instructions to our\ncolleagues and students that they should avoid associating with us outside of\nclass. Waiguoren were risky, especially with regard to politics, and in any\ncase we didn’t need close friends in the college. We could teach during the\nday and return to our comfortable cages at night, and, if we needed\nfriendship, we always had each other. They even gave us telephones so we\ncould call Peace Corps volunteers who lived in other parts of Sichuan.\nSome of the more insightful students sensed that this did not make a full\nlife. In his journal, Soddy wrote me a short note, politely addressed in the\nthird person:\nPete and Adam come to our college to teach our English without pay.\nWe are thankful for this behavior. But we are worried about Pete and\nAdam’s lives. For example: Pete and Adam know little Chinese, so they\ncan’t watch Chinese TV programmes. I think your lives are difficult. I\nwant to know how you spend your spare time.\nIt was a good question. My teaching and preparation time rarely took\nmuch more than thirty hours a week. I ran in the mornings, and sometimes I\nwent for walks in the hills. Adam and I played basketball and threw the\nFrisbee. I wrote on my computer. I planned other diversions for the future—\nsubjects I wanted to cover in class, possible travel destinations. Mostly,\nthough, I knew that there was plenty of exploring to be done in the city, but at\nthe beginning this was the hardest place of all to open up.\nDowntown Fuling looked good from my balcony. Often I’d gaze across",
        "the Wu River at the maze of streets and stairways, listening to the distant hum\nof daily life, and I’d think about the mysteries that were hidden in the river\ntown. I wanted to investigate all of it—I wanted to go down to the docks and\nwatch the boats; I wanted to talk with the stick-stick soldiers; I wanted to\nexplore the network of tangled staircases that ran through the old part of\ntown. I longed to figure out how the city worked and what the people\nthought, especially since no foreigner had done this before. It wasn’t like\nliving in Beijing or Shanghai, where there were plenty of waiguoren who had\ndiscovered what the city had to offer. As far as foreigners were concerned,\nFuling was our city—or it would be once we figured it out.\nBut once I got there it didn’t look so good. Partly this was because of the\ndirt and noise; the main city of Fuling was an unbelievably loud and polluted\nplace. There wasn’t as much heavy industry as in other parts of China, but\nthere were a few good-sized factories that spewed smoke and dust into the\nair. The power plant on the banks of the Wu River burned coal, as did all of\nthe countless small restaurants that lined the city’s streets, and automobile\nemissions were poorly regulated. In winter the air was particularly dirty, but\neven in summer it was bad. If I went to town and blew my nose, the tissue\nwas streaked with black grease. This made me think about how the air was\naffecting my lungs, and for a while I wondered what could be done about\nthis. Finally I decided to stop looking at tissues after I blew my nose.\nNoise was even more impressive. Most of it came from car horns, and it\nis difficult to explain how constant this sound was. I can start by saying:\nDrivers in Fuling honked a lot. There weren’t a great number of cars, but\nthere were enough, and they were always passing each other in a mad rush to\nget to wherever they were going. Most of them were cabs, and virtually every\ncabby in Fuling had rewired his horn so it was triggered by a contact point at\nthe tip of the gearshift. They did this for convenience; because of the hills,\ndrivers shifted gears frequently, and with their hand on the stick it was\npossible to touch the contact point ever so slightly and the horn would sound.\nThey honked at other cars, and they honked at pedestrians. They honked\nwhenever they passed somebody, or whenever they were being passed\nthemselves. They honked when nobody was passing but somebody might be\nconsidering it, or when the road was empty and there was nobody to pass but\nthe thought of passing or being passed had just passed through the driver’s\nmind. Just like that, an unthinking reflex: the driver honked. They did it so",
        "often that they didn’t even feel the contact point beneath their fingers, and the\nother drivers and pedestrians were so familiar with the sound that they\nessentially didn’t hear it. Nobody reacted to horns anymore; they served no\npurpose. A honk in Fuling was like the tree falling in the forest—for all\nintents and purposes it was silent.\nBut at the beginning Adam and I heard it. For the first few weeks we\noften complained about the honking and the noise, the same way we\ncomplained about blowing our noses and seeing the tissue turn black. But the\nsimple truth was that you could do nothing about either the noise or the\npollution, which meant that they could either become very important and\nvery annoying, or they could become not important at all. For sanity’s sake\nwe took the second option, like the locals, and soon we learned to talk about\nother things.\nI realized this in early November, when a college friend of mine named\nScott Kramer came to visit. For five years he had lived in Manhattan, and yet\nthe noise in Fuling absolutely stunned him; he heard every horn, every shout,\nevery blurted announcement from every loudspeaker. When he left, we took a\ncab from the college to the docks, and Kramer, who worked on Wall Street\nand had a mathematical turn of mind, counted the honks as our driver sped\nthrough the city. It was a fifteen-minute ride and the driver touched his\ncontact point 566 times. It came to thirty-seven honks per minute.\nIf Kramer hadn’t been counting, I wouldn’t have noticed, and I realized\nthat I had stopped hearing the horns long ago, just like everybody else in\ntown. In fact, Kramer was the only person in the whole city who heard them,\nwhich explained why he was so overwhelmed. The entire city had been\nhonking at him for a week.\nFor me it wasn’t the same, and after a month or so the discomforts of\nFuling weren’t important enough to deter me from going into town. Despite\nthe noise and the pollution, it was still a fascinating place, and I still wanted\nto explore its corners and learn its secrets. But the language was an enormous\nproblem, and in the beginning it made the city frustrating and even\nfrightening.\nMandarin Chinese has a reputation as a difficult language—some experts\nsay it takes four times as long to learn as Spanish or French—and its\ncharacters and tones are particularly challenging to a Westerner, because they\nare completely different from the way our languages are structured. In",
        "Sichuan, things are further complicated by the provincial dialect, which is\ndistinct enough that a Chinese outsider has trouble understanding the locals in\na place like Fuling. The variations between Mandarin and Sichuanese are\nsignificant: in addition to some differences in vocabulary, Sichuanese slurs\nthe Mandarin reflexive sounds—sh becomes s, zh becomes z—and certain\nconsonants are reversed, so that the average person in Sichuan confuses n and\nl, and h and f. A word like “Hunan” becomes “Fulan.” The Sichuanese tonal\nrange is also shorter, and most significant, two of the four Mandarin tones are\nreversed in Sichuan. If Mandarin is your starting point, it seems that the\nentire language has been flattened and turned upside down.\nIn addition, Sichuan is an enormous province where lack of development,\nparticularly with regard to road and rail links, has resulted in vast regional\ndifferences. The Chengdu dialect is distinct from that of Chongqing, which is\nalso different from that of Leshan, and so on. The town of Fengdu is less than\nthirty miles downstream from Fuling, and yet occasionally the residents of\nthese places have difficulty understanding each other. At a Fuling restaurant,\nif you want the dish known as hundun in Mandarin—translated in English as\n“wonton”—you have to ask for chaoshou, but if you go another thirty miles\nto Fengdu you’ll have to call it baomian. Or, more accurately, baomin,\nbecause the folks in Fengdu slur the ian sounds.\nThe result is a hell of a mess that I hadn’t expected. I came to China\nhoping to learn Chinese, but quickly I realized there was no such thing.\n“Chinese” was whatever it took to communicate with the person you\nhappened to be talking with, and this changed dramatically depending on\nbackground and education level. Educated people usually could speak\nMandarin, especially if they were from the younger generation—the walls of\nour classrooms had enormous signs that commanded: “Use Mandarin!” But\nthe vast majority of Fuling’s population was uneducated and functioned only\nin the dialect. It made going to town a frustrating experience, because even\nthe simplest conversations were difficult, and it also made my goal of\nlearning Chinese seem impossible: I couldn’t imagine learning both\nMandarin and Sichuanese in two years. In fact, all I needed to do was\nimprove my Mandarin, which would naturally enable me to handle the\ndialect, but in the early months I didn’t know that. It seemed that I was in\nhopelessly over my head, and every trip into town was a reminder of that\nfailure.",
        "And Fuling was a frightening place because the people had seen so few\noutsiders. If I ate at a restaurant or bought something from a store, a crowd\nwould quickly gather, often as many as thirty people spilling out into the\nstreet. Most of the attention was innocent curiosity, but it made the\nembarrassment of my bad Chinese all the worse—I’d try to communicate\nwith the owner, and people would laugh and talk among themselves, and in\nmy nervousness I would speak even worse Mandarin. When I walked down\nthe street, people constantly turned and shouted at me. Often they screamed\nwaiguoren or laowai, both of which simply meant “foreigner.” Again, these\nphrases often weren’t intentionally insulting, but intentions mattered less and\nless with every day that these words were screamed at me. Another favorite\nwas “hello,” a meaningless, mocking version of the word that was strung out\ninto a long “hah-loooo!” This word was so closely associated with foreigners\nthat sometimes the people used it instead of waiguoren—they’d say, “Look,\nhere come two hellos!” And often in Fuling they shouted other less innocent\nterms—yangguizi, or “foreign devil” da bizi, “big nose”—although it wasn’t\nuntil later that I understood what these phrases meant.\nThe stresses piled up every time I went into town: the confusion and\nembarrassment of the language, the shouts and stares, the mocking calls. It\nwas even worse for Adam, who was tall and blond; at least I had the\nadvantage of being dark-haired and only slightly bigger than the locals. For a\nwhile we adopted the strategy of going into town together, thinking that\nbetween the two of us we could more easily handle the pressure. This was a\nmistake, though, because adding another waiguoren only increased the\nattention, and after a month of that we started making our trips solo. Finally,\nas the fall semester wore on, we did everything possible to avoid going to\ntown. When I did go, I wore headphones. That was the only way I could\nhandle it; I listened to the loudest and most offensive rap music I had—Dr.\nDre, Snoop Doggy Dogg, the Beastie Boys—and it was just enough to drown\nout the shouts as I walked down the street. It made for surreal trips\ndowntown, listening to Snoop rap obscenities while I dodged the crowds, but\nit kept me sane.\nAnd so Soddy’s question remained: How do you spend your spare time?\nWhen I finished teaching I would sit at my desk, which looked out across the\nWu River to the city, and I would write:",
        "While I wrote, I pronounced the word over and over, as carefully as I\ndrew it:\n“Xue xue xue xue xue xue xue xue xue xue xue xue xue xue xue xue xue\nxue xue xue.”\nI would write the same character about a hundred times total, and then I\nwould think of ways in which it was used: xuexi, xuesheng, xuexiao. I would\nwrite it on a flash card and put it on a stack that grew steadily on my desk—\nbetween five and ten a day, usually. I listened to language tapes and reviewed\nthe text that we had used during Peace Corps training. I flipped through the\nflash cards. By early October, when Dean Fu finally found two Chinese\ntutors, I had learned 150 characters. The signs on the way to Raise the Flag\nMountain were still unintelligible, but the one in the center of campus had\nchanged slightly:\nTeaching People, People,\nPeople, Environment People\nOUR TUTORS were Kong Ming and Liao Mei, and we came to know them\nas Teacher Kong and Teacher Liao. They taught in the Chinese department,\nand neither of them spoke any English. They had never known a waiguoren\nbefore. Dean Fu had been unable to find tutors who spoke English, and at last\nwe told him it wasn’t important. We wanted to get started and we knew that\nChinese department teachers had good Mandarin.\nTeacher Kong was a short man who wore glasses and smelled of\nMagnificent Sound cigarettes. He was thirty-two years old, and he taught\nancient Chinese literature. By Chinese standards he was slightly fat, which\nmeant that by American standards he was slightly thin. He smiled easily. He\nwas from the countryside of Fengdu, which was famous for its ghosts—\nlegend said that spirits went to Fengdu after death.",
        "Teacher Liao was a very thin woman with long black hair and a reserved\nmanner. She was twenty-seven years old, and she taught modern Chinese.\nShe smiled less than Teacher Kong. Our students, who also had some courses\nin the Chinese department, considered Teacher Liao to be one of their better\ninstructors. She was from the central Sichuan city of Zigong, which was\nfamous for its salt. Every city and small town in Sichuan claimed to be\nfamous for something. Fuling was famous for the hot pickled mustard tuber\nthat was cured along the banks of the rivers.\nThat was essentially everything we knew about Teachers Kong and Liao\nfor months. We also knew about their Mandarin, which was very clear except\nfor a slight Sichuanese tendency to confuse the n and l sounds. Other than\nthat we knew nothing. To us they were like Chinese-teaching machines, or\nperhaps farm animals—a sort of inexpensive and bored draft horse that\ncorrected bad tones. And to them we were very stupid waiguoren from a\ncountry whose crude tongue had no tones at all.\nMy first tutorial with Teacher Liao was scheduled for two hours, but I\nlasted less than sixty minutes. I went home with my head reeling—had a\nhuman being ever compressed more wrongness into a single hour?\nEverything was wrong—tones, grammar, vocabulary, initial sounds. She\nwould ask me a question and I would try to process the language to respond,\nbut before I could speak she was answering it herself. She spoke clearly, of\ncourse, and it was also true that during that hour not a word of English had\nbeen spoken. That was what I wanted, after all—a Chinese tutor. But I\ncouldn’t imagine doing that for seven hours a week and maintaining my\nsanity, and I looked at the pathetic stack of flash cards on my desk and\nthought: This is hopeless.\nFor a solid month it looked that way. I was too self-absorbed to even\nimagine what it was like from the other side, but later I realized that it was\neven worse for my teachers. They weren’t under threat of execution for\nteaching the sacred tones to a waiguoren—that law, at least, had been\nchanged since Qing Dynasty days. But theirs wasn’t an enviable job. First of\nall, we underpaid them. This wasn’t intentional; Adam and I had been given\nwrong information about the standard rate for tutors. Teachers Kong and\nLiao, of course, were far too polite to set us straight, which meant that for the\nentire first year they worked for two-thirds of what they deserved. Even\nworse, though, they were underpaid for seven weekly hours of boredom and",
        "frustration. The lessons in the book were simple—taking a train, going to a\nrestaurant—and yet I botched everything, and they had no idea how to steer\nme in the right direction. How do you teach somebody to speak Chinese?\nHow do you take your knowledge of ancient poetry and use it to help a\nwaiguoren master something as basic as the third tone?\nWe were all lost, and that failure seemed to be the extent of our\nrelationship. Other Peace Corps volunteers had tutors who spoke English, so\nat least they could chat together after class. They heard about their tutors’\nfamilies; they ate dinner together; they became friends. My tutors didn’t seem\nlike real people—it was months before I learned that Teacher Liao was\nmarried and that Teacher Kong had a son. Here the language problem was\ncompounded by the fact that at the beginning they were somewhat cagey and\ndistant; they had never known a waiguoren before, and they weren’t at all\ncertain how to approach us.\nChinese teaching styles are also significantly different from western\nmethods, which made my tutorials even more frustrating. In China, a teacher\nis absolutely respected without question, and the teacher-student relationship\ntends to be formal. The teacher teaches and is right, and the student studies\nand is wrong. But this isn’t our tradition in America, as my own students\nnoticed. I encouraged informality in our classes, and if a student was wrong I\npointed out what she had done right and praised her for making a good effort.\nTo them, this praise was meaningless. What was the point of that? If a\nstudent was wrong, she needed to be corrected without any quibbling or\nsoftening—that was the Chinese way.\nI couldn’t teach like that, and it was even harder to play the role of\nstudent. Actually, this became worse after my Chinese classes started to feel\nproductive, which happened more quickly than I expected. The characters in\nmy book’s lessons had always been elusive, odd-shaped scratches of black\nthat drifted in and out of my head, calling up arbitrary allusions that were\nmisleading. They were pictures rather than words: I would look at and\nthink of K-mart, and the twenty-seventh radical— reminded me of the\nletter B, or perhaps an ax hanging on a wall. looked like a man doing\njumping jacks. was a marching spider carrying a flag across the page. I\nstared so long at those odd figures that I dreamed about them—they swarmed",
        "in my head and I awoke vaguely disturbed and missing home.\nBut at a certain point it was as if some of the scratchings stood up straight\nand looked me in the eye, and the fanciful associations started slipping away.\nSuddenly they became words; they had meaning. Of course, it didn’t happen\nall at once, and it was work that did it—I was studying madly in an effort to\nmake the classes less miserable. But I was so busy that I hardly had time to\nrealize that progress was being made.\nOne day after more than a month of classes, I read aloud a paragraph\nfrom my book, recognizing all of the characters smoothly except for one. I sat\nback and started to register the achievement: I was actually reading Chinese.\nThe language was starting to make sense. But before this sense of satisfaction\nwas half formed, Teacher Liao said, “Budui!”\nIt meant, literally, “Not correct.” You could also translate it as no, wrong,\nnope, uh-uh. Flatly and clearly incorrect. There were many Chinese words\nthat I didn’t know, but I knew that one well.\nA voice in my head whined: All of the rest of them were right; isn’t that\nworth something? But for Teacher Liao it didn’t work like that. If one\ncharacter was wrong it was simply budui.\n“What’s this word?” I asked, pointing at the character I had missed.\n“Zhe—the zhe in zhejiang.”\n“Third tone?”\n“Fourth tone.”\nI breathed deeply and read the section again, and this time I did it\nperfectly. That was a victory—I turned to Teacher Liao and my eyes said (or\nat least I imagined them saying): How do you like me now? But Teacher\nLiao’s eyes were glazed with boredom and she said, “Read the next one.”\nThey were, after all, simple paragraphs. Any schoolchild could handle them.\nIt was the Chinese way. Success was expected and failure criticized and\npromptly corrected. You were right or you were budui; there was no middle\nground. As I became bolder with the language I started experimenting with\nnew words and new structures, and this was good but it was also a risk. I\nwould finish a series of sentences using vocabulary that I knew Teacher Liao\ndidn’t expect me to know, and I would swear that I could see her flinch with\nunwilling admiration. And yet she would say, “Budui!” and correct the part\nthat had been wrong.\nI grew to hate budui: its sound mocked me. There was a harshness to it;",
        "the bu was a rising tone and the dui dropped abruptly, building like my\nconfidence and then collapsing all at once. And it bothered me all the more\nbecause I knew that Teacher Liao was only telling the truth: virtually\neverything I did with the language was budui. I was an adult, and as an adult\nI should be able to accept criticism where it was needed. But that wasn’t the\nAmerican way; I was accustomed to having my ego soothed; I wanted to be\npraised for my effort. I didn’t mind criticism as long as it was candy-coated. I\nwas caught in the same trap that I had heard about from some of my Chinese-\nAmerican friends, who as children went to school and became accustomed to\nthe American system of gentle correction, only to return home and hear their\nChinese-minded parents say, simply, budui. That single B on the report card\nmatters much more than the string of A’s that surrounds it. Keep working;\nyou haven’t achieved anything yet.\nAnd so I studied. I was frustrated but I was also stubborn; I was\ndetermined to show Teacher Liao that I was dui. Virtually all of my spare\ntime went to studying Chinese, and the stack of flash cards on my desk grew\nrapidly. By the first week in November I knew three hundred characters. I\nhad no clear idea what I was shooting for—I had a vague goal of reading a\nnewspaper, which would require between two and three thousand. But mostly\nI knew that I needed more knowledge than I had, and I needed it quickly.\nIn the mornings I ran to the summit of Raise the Flag Mountain, charging\nhard up the steps, my lungs burning high above the Yangtze. The effort was\nsatisfying—it was challenging but uncomplicated, and at the finish I could\nlook down on the city and see where I had gone. It was different from the\nwork of learning Chinese, which had no clear endpoint and gave me more\nfrustration than satisfaction.\nThere was a skill to running, and in some ways it was the only skill I had\nin Fuling. Everybody else seemed to have found something that he or she was\ngood at: the owner of the dumpling restaurant made dumplings, the shoeshine\nwomen shined shoes, the stick-stick soldiers carried loads on their leathered\nshoulders. It was less clear what my purpose was—I was a teacher, and that\njob was satisfying and clearly defined, but it disappeared once I left campus.\nMost people in town only saw my failures, the inevitable misunderstandings\nand botched conversations.\nAnd they always watched carefully. The attention was so intense that in\npublic I often became clumsily self-conscious, which was exacerbated by my",
        "suddenly becoming bigger than average. In America I was considered small\nat five feet nine inches, but now for the first time in my life I stood out in\ncrowds. I bumped my head on bus doorways; I squeezed awkwardly behind\nminiature restaurant tables. I was like Alice in Wonderland, eating the\ncurrant-seed cakes and finding her world turned upside down.\nMostly I longed to find something that I could do well. This was part of\nwhy the simple routines of the city fascinated me; I could watch a stick-stick\nsoldier or a restaurant cook with incredible intensity simply because these\npeople were good at what they did. There was a touch of voyeurism in my\nattention, at least in the sense that I watched the people work with all of the\nvoyeur’s impotent envy. There were many days when I would have liked\nnothing more than to have had a simple skill that I could do over and over\nagain, as long as I did it well.\nRunning was repetitive in this way, and it was also an escape. If I ran on\nthe roads, cars honked at me, people laughed and shouted, and sometimes a\nyoung man would try to impress his friends by chasing after me. But crowds\ncouldn’t gather around, and none of the young men followed for long. I ran\nalone, and in a crowded country that sort of solitude was worth something.\nThere was nobody in the city who could catch me.\nUsually I ran in the hills behind campus, following the small roads and\nfootpaths that wound around Raise the Flag Mountain. I ran past old Daoist\nshrines, and atop the narrow walls of the rice paddies, and I followed the\nstone steps that led to the mountain’s summit. I liked running past the ancient\nstone tombs that overlooked the rivers, and I liked seeing the peasants at\nwork. On my runs I watched them harvest the rice crop, and thresh the\nyellowed stalks, and I saw them plant the winter wheat and tend their\nvegetables. I first learned the agricultural patterns by watching the workers as\nI ran, and I studied the shape of the mountain by feeling it beneath my legs.\nThe peasants found it strange that I ran in the hills, and they always stared\nwhen I charged past, but they never shouted or laughed. As a rule they were\nthe most polite people you could ever hope to meet, and in any case they had\nmore important things to do with their energy than scream at waiguoren. And\nperhaps they had an innate respect for physical effort, even when they didn’t\nsee the point.\nThe air in the countryside was often bad, because the Yangtze winds blew\nthe city’s pollution across the Wu River, and I knew that running did my",
        "health more harm than good. But it kept my mind steady, because the fields\nwere quiet and peaceful and the activity felt the same as it always had. That\nold well-known feeling—the catch in my chest, the strain in my legs—\nconnected all the places where I had lived, Missouri and Princeton and\nOxford and Fuling. While I ran through the hills, my thoughts swung fluidly\nbetween these times and places; I remembered running along the old\nMissouri-Kansas-Texas railroad pathway, and I recalled the rapeseed\nblooming gold on Boar’s Hill, and the old shaded bridge of Prettybrook. As\nthe months slipped past I realized that even these Sichuan hills, with their\nstrange tombs and terraces, were starting to feel like home.\nBut still the signs on the way to Raise the Flag Mountain were foreign,\nand even as they slowly became familiar they reminded me how far I still had\nto go:\nBuild Culture, New Give Birth\nPopulation Increase, Society\nEducation Is a Powerful Country’s\nDURING THAT SEMESTER there was a volatility to the written language;\nit constantly shifted in my eyes, and each day the shapes became something\nother than what they had been before. Spoken Chinese was also starting to\nsettle in my ears, and soon I could make simple conversation with the owners\nof the restaurants where I ate. The same slow shift was also happening with\nregard to my tutors, who finally started to change from tone machines into\nreal people.\nAs this happened, I began to sense an edge to Teacher Liao that I couldn’t\nquite figure. It wasn’t simply her tendency to say budui; she seemed slightly",
        "uncomfortable around both Adam and me, and there were moments when I\nalmost thought she disliked us (which, given that we didn’t pay her enough,\nwould have been understandable). Later, I would come to recognize other\nreasons for this discomfort, but during that first semester I only sensed that\nthere were complications in our relationship.\nOnce we had a tutorial the day after I had played in the faculty basketball\ntournament, and she asked what I had thought of the game. In fact, it had\ngone very badly—Adam and I were starting to realize that there was a great\ndeal of resentment over our participation, because the English department\nteam was now suddenly very good. To the other participants, the games were\ntaking on a patriotic significance; it was a matter of China vs. America, an\nissue of saving face for the Motherland, and the games grew steadily rougher\nand rougher. The referees also took sides; they allowed our opponents to foul\nus while constantly whistling us for phantom violations. In the game before\nour tutorial, I had been whistled more than fifteen times for double-dribble—\nby the end of the game I only had to touch the ball and the whistle would\nblow. Adam and I were considering pulling out of the tournament, which we\neventually did. It seemed the best solution for everybody involved.\nI knew that Teacher Liao had been at the game, and I assumed that she\nfelt the same way I did. My students had been embarrassed by the poor\nsportsmanship, and they told me that the referee had a horrible reputation on\ncampus. He was notorious for getting into fights—once he even threatened an\nadministrator with a knife. His wife had recently divorced him; the rumor\nwas that he had beaten her. And yet the college was unable to fire him,\nbecause of the job security that was promised to all state workers under the\ntraditional Communist system.\nI answered Teacher Liao’s question honestly, telling her that I hadn’t\nfound the game much fun.\n“That referee,” I said, “is a huai dan.” It was a common insult: bad egg.\n“Budui!” said Teacher Liao. “It wasn’t his problem—you were wrong.\nAnd you should not criticize the referee.”\nTo me this seemed insult upon injury. I wanted to tell her: There are no\ntones in basketball and you have no jurisdiction over it. But she had more to\nsay.\n“You were dribbling wrong,” she said. “That’s why he kept penalizing\nyou. You were doing this—” And she gestured, showing me that I had carried",
        "the ball.\n“Budui!” I said. “That’s not what I was doing. I was dribbling the same\nway I always do in America. That referee just doesn’t like waiguoren. And he\ndoesn’t understand basketball.”\n“Budui! Here you can’t dribble the same way that you do in America,\nbecause they have different rules in the NBA. That’s the problem—you’re\naccustomed to playing the American way.”\nShe said it in hopes of ending the argument tactfully, because she saw\nthat I was annoyed. But I had already heard too many explanations about “the\nChinese way,” and I did not want to be lectured about Basketball with\nChinese Characteristics.\n“Basketball is an American sport,” I said. “We made the rules and I\nunderstand them. That referee just doesn’t like waiguoren.” After I spoke, I\nrealized how stupid my words sounded, and I might as well have continued:\nAnd we Americans can study a language for only four months and already\nconvey our arrogance. But I didn’t have the vocabulary for that, and in any\ncase it was clear that both of us wanted to talk about something else. We\nreviewed a lesson about going to the airport and nobody mentioned\nbasketball again.\nClasses were simpler with Teacher Kong, who alternated weeks with\nTeacher Liao. He was slightly less inclined to say budui, partly because he\nhad a lazy streak, but also because the struggles of that semester were slowly\nteaching us to recognize each other as people. Eventually he would become\nmy first real Chinese friend—the first friend who saw me strictly in Chinese.\nAnd even in those early months, before we developed a true friendship, I\ncould see his interest growing. He sometimes asked me about America,\nwithin the limits of my vocabulary, and I sensed there were many questions\nhe would ask once he had the chance. Certainly I had a few of my own that\nwere waiting for the language to catch up with my thoughts.\nWe had classes in my dining room, where the morning light was warm\nafter the sun rose above the shoulder of Raise the Flag Mountain. We drank\ntea while we studied—jasmine flower tea, the tiny dried petals unfolding like\nblooming lilies on the surface of the hot water. Before he drank, Teacher\nKong blew softly over the cup, so the loose leaves and flowers floated to the\nfar side, and this was something else I learned in those classes. If he sipped a\nleaf by mistake, he turned and spat lightly on the floor. I learned that, too—I",
        "liked living in a cadre’s apartment and still being able to spit on the floor.\nOne sunny afternoon in December, I was preparing for class when I heard\nloud music blaring from the plaza below. There wasn’t anything unusual\nabout that—the campus loudspeakers were always vomiting noise. But today\nI looked down from my balcony and saw a crowd assembling in front of the\nauditorium, and I knew that some sort of important event was about to take\nplace.\nMy balcony looked straight down to the plaza and I could see everything\nclearly. A banner had been unfurled and stretched above the steps. I couldn’t\nmake out most of the characters, but a few were recognizable: “Safety,”\n“Environment,” “Peace.” A row of chairs materialized below the banner. The\ncrowd grew larger. Tables were set in front of the chairs. A blue cloth was\nlaid upon the tables; teacups were put on the cloth. Microphones appeared.\nI had seen this sort of arrangement before—it was a nesting area for\ncadres. Soon six of them marched up the steps and took their places at the\ntable. I strained to see who they were, but I couldn’t recognize their faces,\nand all I saw was that some were in uniform. But many people in Fuling wore\nuniforms and that never told you anything.\nThe speeches began, echoing up to my balcony. A crowd gathered at the\nbottom of the auditorium steps—mostly students, but also people from the\nneighborhood outside the gates, old peasants and women with their babies.\nThey listened quietly, and in their silence I could see that it was a serious\nevent. The speeches reverberated in the plaza and I couldn’t understand what\nthey were saying.\nTeacher Kong arrived for class and set his books on the dining-room\ntable. “It’s very loud,” he said, smiling, and I agreed—too loud to concentrate\non Lesson Thirty-one and its mindless description of a train ride to Guilin.\nWe stepped out onto the balcony and watched the crowd. There were\nhundreds of people listening to the speeches now, and I could see groups of\nstudents hurrying down from the teaching building.\n“All of the students have been excused from class,” Teacher Kong said,\nand I asked him what the event was. “They’re going to panjue two people,”\nhe said. “It’s a public panjue.”\nI hadn’t studied the word, and he explained its meaning until I was nearly\ncertain I understood. I went into the dining room to double-check with the\ndictionary—“panjue: bring a verdict; judgment.” They were having a public",
        "sentencing in front of the auditorium.\n“Are they students?” I asked.\n“No. They’re from East River.”\nI asked what they had done, and he explained that there had been a series\nof fights between East River people and students in the physical education\ndepartment. East River was a rough part of town, a seedy riverfront section of\nsmall shops and dusty warehouses. After the Three Gorges Dam was built,\nmuch of East River would disappear underwater, and few people would\nprobably miss it. The dirty streets were depressing, and the residents, most of\nwhom were poor, saw the students as privileged outsiders—spoiled kids who\nlived six or seven to a bare room, cleaned their unheated classrooms, and\nwoke up at six o’clock every morning for mandatory exercises. Sichuanese\ntown-and-gown tension was, like anything else, a matter of relative\nconditions.\nRecently this animosity had turned ugly; some of the East River men had\nused knives and sticks in the fights, and a couple of students had been hurt. I\nheard about it from my own students, who wrote in their journals about a\nweekend night when two physical education boys had been injured and their\nfriends returned to the dormitory for reinforcements. They were collecting\nweapons of their own when the police arrived.\n“None of the injuries was too serious,” said Teacher Kong. “But they\nwant to show the students that the college is safe, so today they’re having a\npublic panjue.”\nThe cadres finished their speeches, the crowd waiting in expectant\nsilence. Two men appeared, flanked by policemen. They wore cheap suits\nand their hands were cuffed behind their backs. The police marched them\nhalfway down the steps of the auditorium, where they stood between the\ncadres and the crowd. The two men’s heads were bowed. The students had\npressed to the front; at the back stood the peasants and the mothers with their\nbabies. Everybody was quiet. In the background, from the Wu River, I heard\nthe low growl of riverboat horns.\nOne of the cadres read from a sheet of paper. His voice echoed over the\nplaza, and in response the crowd shifted and murmured. The two men kept\ntheir heads down.\n“A few days,” Teacher Kong said. “Only a few days in jail. Not very\nserious.”",
        "And in that instant it was over: the cops took the handcuffed men out the\nfront gate, where a bus was waiting; the cadres disappeared; the tables were\nwhisked away; the banner was taken down; the students returned to class.\nThe people in Fuling were extremely organized with public events and their\nrallies could materialize and disappear in the space of an hour. Within fifteen\nminutes there was no sign that anything had happened in the plaza.\nTeacher Kong and I reviewed some vocabulary from the trial, and then\nwe moved on to Lesson Thirty-one. There was something strange about\nreturning so quickly to class after having watched the sentencing from high\nabove, as from a luxury box at a stadium, turning somebody’s public\nhumiliation into a vocabulary lesson. But many things were public in Fuling\nand few locals would have found it unusual. I had Peace Corps friends at\nanother Sichuan teachers college who, the following spring, had their classes\ncanceled one afternoon for a pre-execution rally in the school’s sports\nstadium. Student attendance at the event was mandatory, because the\ncriminals were young drug dealers and their deaths would provide a valuable\nlesson for the spectators. The college gathered in the stadium, where the\npolice paraded the condemned prisoners in front of the students. Afterward\nthe criminals were taken away to the countryside and shot. Classes resumed\nas normal the next day.\nNOT LONG AFTER the sentencing, I came back from a run and realized\nthat the sign in the center of campus had become completely intelligible. This\nwas a moment I had always looked forward to—from the beginning, I had\nseen that string of characters as a benchmark, and I traced my progress in the\nway those words became meaningful. And one day all of it finally made\nsense:\nTeaching Educates the People, Administration Educates the People,\nService Educates the People, Environment Educates the People\nI stopped and took a long look. I read the sign again, waiting for the sense",
        "of achievement. But nothing was there—it was simply propaganda, the same\nsort of trite phrase that could be found in the students’ textbooks or on\nbillboards all across the city. I would react the same way when the other\nmessages on the way to Raise the Flag Mountain came into focus:\nConstruct a Spiritual Civilization, Replace the Old Concept of\nGiving Birth\nControlling Population Growth Promotes Social Development\nEducation Is the Foundation upon Which a Powerful Nation Is Built\nAll of it was the same old cant. Every time one of the signs became\nintelligible, I felt very little of the satisfaction that I had once imagined.\nInstead I heard Teacher Liao’s voice in my head: Read the next one. You\nhaven’t achieved anything yet. And so I kept writing the characters over and\nover again at my desk, gazing out my window at the city.\nLATE ONE AFTERNOON in December, Adam and I were summoned to\nthe English department office, where we were informed that there would be a\nbanquet tonight. These announcements were always made at the last minute,\nand they meant that the evening was effectively finished, because it was\nimpossible to go to a banquet and not get hopelessly drunk.\nA good part of our Peace Corps medical training had involved\npreparation for these moments. Even though we were only the third Peace\nCorps China group, the Sichuan countryside was already littered with tales of\nvolunteers who had become banquet casualties. There were stories of fights,\nof vandalism, of volunteers who had become so dangerously intoxicated that\nthey forever swore off drinking at such occasions. Our medical officer\nstrongly recommended that after arriving at site we establish ourselves as\nnondrinkers, at least as far as banquets were concerned.\nThe most frequently performed procedure in Sichuanese emergency\nrooms was stomach-pumping. The vast majority of these patients were male,\nbecause drinking, like smoking, was an important part of being a man. This",
        "was true in many parts of China, especially in the more remote regions, and\nSichuan drinking wasn’t simply a casual way to relax. Often it was\ncompetitive, and usually it involved baijiu, a powerful and foul-tasting grain\nalcohol. Men toasted each other with full shots, and there was a tendency for\nthis drinking to turn into a kind of bullying, the participants goading each\nother until somebody got sick. One of our Peace Corps training sessions had\ninvolved personal testimony from a Sichuanese man, who shrugged\nsheepishly and explained that even good friends were perfectly willing to\ndrink each other into the hospital. Like the medical officer, he recommended\nthat we use our waiguoren status to avoid this ritual entirely.\nIt was a typical Peace Corps scenario: having been told a wealth of horror\nstories about the pointless machismo of Sichuanese drinking, Adam and I\nwere promptly sent down the river to the most remote Peace Corps site in the\nprovince. At our welcoming banquet, when we were served our first shot of\nbaijiu, neither of us hesitated for even a second. Our training had repeatedly\nemphasized that this was critical to whatever it took to be a man in a place\nlike Fuling, and as far as we were concerned this was part of our job. We\nhadn’t come all this way just to be waiguoren. We downed the shot, and we\ndowned the next one, too.\nDuring that first month we had two or three banquets a week, and soon I\ncould see that all of the drinking was organized with remarkable intricacy\nThe faculty took it easy on us at the beginning, no doubt because the Peace\nCorps had given all the colleges a stern warning about responsibility. But\neventually our colleagues came to the same conclusion that we had: the Peace\nCorps was far away. Steadily the pressure to drink increased, and as time\npassed I realized that the English department had an alcoholic leaderboard.\nThis wasn’t a literal leaderboard in the sense of being written down, but it\nwas completely public and accepted. You could ask any teacher where his\nalcohol tolerance stood in relation to everybody else’s in the department, and\nhe would answer with well-tested precision. Party Secretary Zhang was at the\ntop, followed by Albert, then Dean Fu, and so on through the ranks until you\ncame to Teacher Sai, who was such a lightweight that people referred to him\nscornfully as “Miss Sai” during banquets.\nWithin three weeks Adam was the undisputed number one drinker in the\nEnglish department. I was ranked second; Party Secretary Zhang slipped to\nthird. In truth I wasn’t much of a drinker at home, but Fuling tolerance levels",
        "tended to be low, because many residents have a genetic intolerance of\nalcohol that is common among Asians. Even Party Secretary Zhang, despite\nhis lofty ranking, turned bright red after a few drinks. This was one reason\nwhy local drinking patterns were so abusive with relatively light\nconsequences; most people were genetically unable to become alcoholics.\nOnce or twice a week they might be able to drink heavily, but they got too\nsick to do it all the time. It was a ritual rather than a habit.\nIn a pathetic way, drinking became one small thing that Adam and I were\ngood at, although it was difficult to take much pride in this. If anything, it\nsaid a great deal about our troubles adjusting to Fuling life, because the\nbanquets and the drinking, despite their strange childishness, represented one\nof our more comfortable environments. We gained instant respect for our\ntolerance levels, and to a certain degree this was how the department\nauthorities communicated with us. If they had something important to tell us,\nor if a request needed to be made, it was handled at a banquet. Our\ncolleagues, who usually seemed stiff and nervous around the waiguoren,\nloosened up once the baijiu started flowing. These events were strictly all-\nmale—the only women involved were the waitresses who served the baijiu.\nBefore the December banquet, Adam and I were escorted into the English\ndepartment office to meet our hosts for the evening. Two men stood up and\nshook our hands, smiling. One of them was a tall handsome man in his forties\nand the other was a short older man of perhaps sixty years. The tall man wore\na new sweater, and from the way he carried himself it was clear that he was\nimportant—a cadre. It was also just as obvious that they were here to make\nsome request of us, because they were sponsoring the meal. Teacher Sai and\nDean Fu were there to translate.\n“This is Mr. Wang from the Chinese department,” Teacher Sai said. “Mr.\nWang came to the college in 1977—he was part of the first class when the\ncollege opened after the Great Cultural Revolution. He was the best English\nstudent, but English was not a preferred subject in those days. So he became\na Chinese professor instead. But he is still very interested in English.”\nAdam and I shook Teacher Wang’s hand again. Teacher Sai seemed to\nhave forgotten the other man, who didn’t appear to be offended. Obviously\nhe was accustomed to moving in the bigger man’s wake.\nAll of us sat down. Adam and I waited for the request; cynically I\nassumed that Teacher Wang wanted English lessons. Already I could imagine"

Insights, Interviews & More…\nAcknowledgments\nPraise\nCredits\nCopyright\nAbout the Publisher\n\nMaps\n\nAUTHOR’S NOTE\nTHE CHAPTERS OF THIS BOOK describe my life in Fuling, while the\ninterspersed sketches focus on the local landscape, its history, and the people.\nAll of these sketches were written while I still lived there, and I’ve used this\nstructure to give the reader some sense of the two roles that a foreigner plays\nin a town like Fuling. Sometimes I was an observer, while at other moments I\nwas very much involved in local life, and this combination of distance and\nintimacy was part of what shaped my two years in Sichuan.\nA few of the characters’ names and other identifying features have been\nchanged in cases where the subject matter is sensitive. I’ve relied on the\nstandard pinyin romanization for most of the Chinese names and words, with\nexceptions for a few well-known names such as Yangtze and Hong Kong.\nThis isn’t a book about China. It’s about a certain small part of China at a\ncertain brief period in time, and my hope has been to capture the richness of\nboth the moment and the place. The place I know well—the murky Yangtze,\nthe green well-worked mountains—but the moment is more difficult to\ndefine. Fuling was situated midriver both geographically and historically, and\nsometimes it was hard to see where things came from and where they were\ngoing. But the town and its people were always full of life and energy and\nhope, which in the end is my subject. Rather than an inquiry into a source or\na destination, this is an account of what it was like to spend two years in the\nheart of the great river’s current.\n\nPART I\n\nCHAPTER ONE\n\nDownstream\nI CAME TO FULING on the slow boat downstream from Chongqing. It\nwas a warm, clear night at the end of August in 1996—stars flickering above\nthe Yangtze River, their light too faint to reflect off the black water. A car\nfrom the college drove us along the narrow streets that twisted up from the\ndocks. The city rushed past, dim and strange under the stars.\nThere were two of us. We had been sent to work as teachers, and both of\nus were young: I was twenty-seven and Adam Meier was twenty-two. We\nhad heard almost nothing about Fuling. I knew that part of the city would be\nflooded by the new Three Gorges Dam, and I knew that for many years\nFuling had been closed to outsiders. Other than that I had been told very\nlittle.\nNo Americans had lived there for half a century. Later, I would meet\nolder people in town who remembered some American residents in the\n1940s, before the 1949 Communist Liberation, but such memories were\nalways vague. When we arrived, there was one other foreigner, a German\nwho was spending a semester teaching at a local high school. But we met him\nonly once, and he left not long after we settled in. After that we were the only\nforeigners in town. The population was about 200,000, which made it a small\ncity by Chinese standards.\nThere was no railroad in Fuling. It had always been a poor part of\nSichuan province and the roads were bad. To go anywhere you took the boat,\nbut mostly you didn’t go anywhere. For the next two years the city was my\nhome.\nA WEEK AFTER WE ARRIVED, everybody in the college gathered at the\nfront gate. A group of students and teachers had spent the summer walking\nfrom Fuling to Yan’an, the former revolutionary base in northern Shaanxi\n\nprovince, and now they were returning to school.\nIt was the sixtieth anniversary of the Long March, the six-thousand-mile\ntrek that the Red Army had made during the most critical part of the civil\nwar, when the Kuomintang was on the verge of destroying Mao Zedong’s\nforces. Against all odds the Communists had marched to safety, over the\nmountains and deserts of western China, and from Yan’an they had steadily\nbuilt their strength until at last their revolution carried the nation, driving the\nKuomintang to Taiwan.\nAll semester there were special events in the college to commemorate the\nanniversary of the march. The students took classes on the history of the\nLong March, they wrote essays about the Long March, and in December\nthere was a Long March Singing Contest. For the Long March Singing\nContest, all of the departments practiced their songs for weeks and then\nperformed in the auditorium. Many of the songs were the same, because the\nmusical potential of the Long March is limited, which made the judging\ndifficult. It was also confusing because costumes were in short supply and so\nthey were shared, like the songs. The history department would perform,\nresplendent in clean white shirts and red ties, and then they would go offstage\nand quickly give their shirts and ties to the politics department, who would\nget dressed, rush onstage, and sing the same song that had just been sung. By\nthe end of the evening the shirts were stained with sweat and everybody in\nthe audience knew all the songs. The music department won, as they always\ndid, and English was near the back. The English department never won any\nof the college’s contests. There aren’t any English songs about the Long\nMarch.\nBut the summer walk to Yan’an was not a contest, and the return of the\nFuling group was by far the biggest event of the Long March season. They\nhad walked more than a thousand miles, all of it in the brutal heat of the\nChinese summer, and in the end only sixteen had made it. Thirteen were\nstudents, and two were teachers: the Chinese department’s Communist Party\nSecretary and the math department’s Assistant Political Adviser. There was\nalso a lower-level administrator, who had burst into tears in the middle of the\nwalk and gained a measure of local fame for his perseverance. All of the\nparticipants were men. Some of the women students had wanted to come\nalong, but the college had decided that the Long March was not for girls.\nA week before the assembly, President Li, the head of the college, had\n\ntraveled to Xi’an to meet the marching students, because at the finish of the\ntrek they had run into trouble.\n“The students have some kind of problem,” said Dean Fu Muyou, the\nhead of the English department, when I asked him what had happened. “I\nthink they probably have no money left.” And it was true—they had run out\nof cash, despite their sponsorship by Magnificent Sound cigarettes, the Fuling\ntobacco company. It struck me as a particularly appropriate way to honor the\nhistory of Chinese Communism, to march a thousand miles and end up\nbankrupt in Yan’an.\nBut President Li had been able to bail them out, and now the entire\nstudent body of the college met in the plaza near the front gate. It was a small\nteachers college with an enrollment of two thousand students, and it had been\nopened in 1977, one of many that were founded after the 1966–1976 Cultural\nRevolution had destroyed much of China’s education system. On the\nspectrum of Chinese higher education, this type of teachers college was near\nthe bottom. Courses took three years and the degree was considered lower\nthan a bachelor’s, and nearly all of the students came from peasant homes in\nthe countryside of Sichuan province. After graduation they returned to their\nhometowns, where they became teachers in rural middle-schools.\nFor many of the students, especially the freshmen, the college was an\nexciting place. Campus was just across the Wu River from the main city of\nFuling, and few of the students had ever lived near a city that large. The\ncollege had movies, competitions, and dances on the weekends. Often there\nwere political rallies and assemblies like the one to welcome the Long\nMarchers, and the students buzzed with anticipation as they milled around the\nplaza.\nA group of eight women students stood at attention near the gate. They\nwore white blouses and black skirts, and across their chests were red sashes\nemblazoned with the name of the college. They were known as Hospitality\nGirls, and they had been carefully selected from the student body. All of the\nHospitality Girls were tall and beautiful, and none of them smiled. They\nrepresented the college at official functions, standing in perfect formation,\nwalking gracefully, pouring tea for dignitaries.\nThat was something else I had heard about Fuling: its women had a\nreputation for being beautiful. At least that’s what I had been told in my\nChinese class in Chengdu. One of my teachers was from Manchuria, a wisp\n\nof a woman with high cheekbones who had a gentle, skittish way of speaking.\nEven in summer she clutched a bottle of tea in both hands as if for warmth.\nHer name was Teacher Shang, and though she had never been to Fuling she\nsaid with conviction that the women there would be beautiful.\n“It’s because of the river and the mountains,” she said. “All places with\nmountains and water have beautiful women.”\nAnd in Chengdu I had met a Fuling native who told me the same thing.\n“But sometimes the people there have bad tempers,” she warned. “That’s\nbecause it’s so hot, and because they have mountains there.” I often heard\nremarks like this, and they suggested that the Chinese saw their landscapes\ndifferently than outsiders did. I looked at the terraced hills and noticed how\nthe people had changed the earth, taming it into dizzying staircases of rice\npaddies; but the Chinese looked at the people and saw how they had been\nshaped by the land. During my early days at the college I sometimes thought\nabout this, especially since nearly all of my students had grown up close to\nthe earth, and I wondered how the rugged Sichuan landscape had affected\nthem. And at the same time I wondered what it would do to me in two years.\nTHE FULING MAYOR was the first to arrive. He was chauffeured to the\ncollege gate in a black Audi, and he stepped out of the car and waved briefly\nto the students’ applause. The local TV news was there and they filmed him,\na short pudgy man puffing in the September heat. Quickly he walked across\nthe plaza and greeted Adam and me, shaking our hands and welcoming us to\nthe city.\nThat was often the first thing that happened at events we attended in\nFuling—the new Americans were greeted. On the day of the Long March\nrally we had been on our way to a hike, dressed casually in shorts and T-\nshirts, and we had stopped by out of curiosity. It was a foolish mistake to\nattend something of that sort without dressing appropriately, and we should\nhave known better, because already we were learning that it was difficult to\nwatch anything without becoming the center of attention.\nPatriotic music blared from the campus loudspeakers as the Long\nMarchers arrived. They wore white T-shirts and camouflage fatigues. They\nwere unshaven. Old canvas military packs hung from their shoulders. The\n\nleader carried a faded red banner that bore the name of the college and\nMagnificent Sound cigarettes, and he marched behind the Hospitality Girls,\nwho were divided into two rows of four, walking in step, their heads steady,\neyes straight ahead, arms swinging sharply. The rest of the Long Marchers\nfollowed in single file, smiling proudly and waving to the crowd. Everybody\napplauded, and the audience followed the procession into the auditorium,\nwhere a banner proclaimed:\nWarmly Welcome the Fuling Teachers College Magnificent Sound\nCigarette Ten-Thousand-Mile Long March Team as They Return from\nVictory!\nAdam and I ducked into seats at the back of the auditorium, hoping to\navoid attention. The students around us murmured and turned to stare. The\nattention spread, and soon everybody in the auditorium was craning their\nnecks to see us—sinking in our chairs, baseball hats pulled low over our\nfaces—and in a moment Vice President Dou was leading us onto the stage.\nReally he had no choice; otherwise the audience’s attention would have been\ndivided. This was one reason why we were so often incorporated into local\nevents: it was a simple way to make sure people watched.\nWe were seated alongside the mayor and the Communist Party Secretary\nand the other cadres. The crowd roared as we took our seats; the Long\nMarchers applauded. The Hospitality Girls served us tea. I kept my head\ndown and tried to hide my bare legs beneath the table. The cadres gave their\nspeeches, praising the Long Marchers and reminding the crowd of the great\nhistory that was being honored. The speeches were delivered forcefully, like\nold films of dictators, and none of the speakers was better than Vice President\nDou. He was a tiny man in his fifties who weighed perhaps 115 pounds, and\nthere was a sparrowlike quality to his thin chest and delicate light-boned\narms. But he worked the microphone brilliantly—at first softly, calmly, like a\nlecturer talking to a group of children; now louder, slowly quickening the\ngestures, a slender hand waving out over the crowd, almost as if scolding\nthem; and finally he was shouting, arms pumping, eyes flashing,\n\nloudspeakers booming, the speaker and his audience now equal, united as\ncomrades, patriots, servants of humanity; the crowd rising and erupting into\ncheers and a mad rush of applause.\nI heard him say Adam’s and my Chinese names, Mei Erkang and He Wei,\nand he announced that we had been sent to Fuling by the U.S.-China\nFriendship Volunteers, which was the Chinese term for Peace Corps. The\ncrowd roared again—all of us were comrades now, together serving the\npeople, building the country—and the Long Marchers stood proudly as each\nwas pinned on the chest by a dignitary bearing a ribbon and a red plastic\nflower. Somebody handed me a flower and a ribbon; somebody else pointed\nme toward a Long Marcher waiting at the front of the stage. He smiled,\nbowed, and shook my hand fervently. I apologized and pinned him as quickly\nas possible, hoping to minimize the limelight on my shorts, but the crowd\ncheered again and I waved, the applause rising once more. I sat down, my\nface hot.\nAfter the ceremony they took a photograph to commemorate the event. In\nthe picture, the Long Marchers and the cadres are standing proudly in three\nrows, carefully spaced, and the faded red banner is unfurled in the style of the\nold revolutionary units. The Fuling Long Marchers wear clean white T-shirts\nand red ribbons on their chests. They are not smiling. The most important\ncadres stand in the front row, along with Adam and me. Vice President Dou\nand Communist Party Secretary Wei are smiling slightly while we grin in\nembarrassment. Adam is wearing sandals and I have on an old gray T-shirt,\nand our bare legs interrupt the row of neat trousers. None of the other cadres\nis smiling. There are no women in the photograph.\nTWO YEARS LATER, after I returned to America, I would show that\npicture to friends and try to tell the story. But where to begin? To explain\nwhy the post-Cultural Revolution college was honoring the Long March was\nas difficult as telling how the mountains had been turned into terraces. Finally\nI would say: This was a political assembly at our college, and our\nparticipation was a surprise, because in most parts of the world Peace Corps\nvolunteers are not welcomed with Communist Party rallies. And I left it at\nthat—that was my story of the photograph.\n\nOf course, none of it was that simple. I was a Peace Corps volunteer but I\nwasn’t; China was Communist but it wasn’t. Nothing was quite what it\nseemed, and that was how life went in those early days, everything uncertain\nand half a step off.\nIn Chinese, Peace Corps was Heping Dui, and there was more to those\nthree simple characters than met the eye. During the Cultural Revolution,\nwhen anti-American propaganda reached a climax, the Chinese government\nhad said much about the Peace Corps—that it was in league with the CIA,\nthat it was an agent of Western imperialism, that America sent its young\npeople overseas so their idealism would influence the Third World toward\nCapitalism (the toughest job you’ll ever love). These things were no longer\nsaid, but the echoes still remained, and the word was hopelessly tainted. But\nthe Chinese language, like the people, had learned to shift with the political\nwinds, and another title was found when the Peace Corps came to China in\n1993—Meizhong Youhou Zhiyuanzhe, U.S.-China Friendship Volunteers.\nThe characters were more complicated but the connotations infinitely\nsimpler. College authorities instructed our students never to use the term\n“Peace Corps,” in English or Chinese, and most of them didn’t. And so with a\neuphemism for a job title, I came to teach at a college that was built on the\nashes of the Cultural Revolution, where history was never far away and\npolitics everywhere you looked.\nIt was the Friendship that terrified all of us at the beginning. That was the\npart of the title that was difficult to translate or interpret. The college had had\nthree foreign teachers the year before, an elderly Australian couple and a\nmiddle-aged man from Mexico, but that had been simpler because they were\nthere for less than a year and rarely strayed far from campus. We were\ndifferent—we were young, we were planning to live in Fuling for two years,\nand we had been sent by the American government as part of the third group\nof Peace Corps volunteers to come to China. The college gave us apartments\nin its best building, where the Communist Party Secretary and the other most\nimportant cadres lived, and for weeks they banqueted us almost every other\nnight. There was a protocol to these affairs. We would sit down to a table full\nof Chinese appetizers—cashews, dried beef, string beans, lotus root—and\noften Teacher Han would make an announcement. He was the interim\nrepresentative of the college waiban, or foreign affairs office, and he was\ntwenty-seven years old. He had the best spoken English in the college, but he\n\nwas an uneasy young man in a new position of authority. He asked us to call\nhim Albert.\nOne evening in the first week, he turned to us before the banquet had\nbegun.\n“The college has decided,” he said, “to buy you telephones that can call\noutside the college. You will be able to call anywhere in China.”\nWe protested—it wasn’t necessary, phones were expensive, volunteers at\nother colleges didn’t have them. He waved us off. “Not a problem,” he said.\n“Otherwise it’s not convenient for you.” Adam and I looked at each other and\nshrugged. We thanked him, and everybody began to eat, and the next day\nrepairmen appeared to install our telephones.\nA few days later there was another banquet, another announcement. “The\ncollege has decided,” Albert said, “that it will buy Adam a washing\nmachine.”\n“I already have one in my apartment,” I said. “We can share that one—\nthere’s no need to waste money.”\n“It is inconvenient,” Albert said. “The college has decided.” Again our\nprotests were ignored. And so we began to eat, and the next morning a new\nwashing machine appeared at Adam’s door.\nA few days later, Adam was playing cards with some of the English\ndepartment faculty members, and Party Secretary Zhang Yan mentioned that\nthe college had received our résumés and biographical information from the\nPeace Corps.\n“I see that you play tennis,” said Party Secretary Zhang. “You must play\nvery well.”\nAdam had coached at a tennis camp during college summers, and he was\nquick to shake his head. “I don’t play that well,” he said. “It’s been a long\ntime since I played seriously.”\nParty Secretary Zhang grinned and picked up his cards. He was a thin,\nsinewy man with crewcut hair, and it had taken us a week to establish two\nfacts about him: he was the best basketball player on the English department\nfaculty, as well as the best drinker of Chinese baijiu, or grain alcohol. He was\nalso the highest-ranking cadre in the department, and as Communist Party\nSecretary he had authority over academic, disciplinary, and political issues.\nHe was the sort of man who rarely spoke, but when he did speak, things\nhappened. Now he examined his cards, leaned forward, and looked up at\n\nAdam.\n“The college,” he said softly, “has decided to buy you tennis!”\nHe sat back in his chair, waiting for the meaning of the declaration to sink\nin. But that was the problem—how exactly does one go about buying tennis?\nFor a few moments Adam tried to decide how he should respond.\n“That’s very kind of the college,” he said at last, speaking carefully. “I\nappreciate that you want to do something for us, but it isn’t necessary. You\ndon’t have to buy me tennis, Mr. Zhang.”\nParty Secretary Zhang smiled as he discarded a card.\n“Mr. Wei,” he said, “is concerned that you might want to play tennis. He\nwants to make sure that you and Pete are happy.”\nMr. Wei was the Party Secretary of the entire college, and as the highest-\nlevel Communist Party official on campus he undoubtedly had more\nimportant things to do than buy tennis for Peace Corps volunteers. Adam said\nsomething to this effect, emphasizing that he was quite happy without tennis.\nBut Party Secretary Zhang was firm.\n“It has been decided,” he said flatly. “The college will buy you tennis.\nNow it is time to play cards.”\nTHE NEXT MORNING, tennis did not appear at Adam’s doorstep, but he\ndidn’t take any chances. He told me about the conversation, and together we\nmade an attempt to communicate to the college, the sort of effort that over the\nnext two years would be made again and again, with mixed results. Often our\ncommunication was indirect, and rarely was it simple. Sometimes it resulted\nin exactly the opposite of what we wanted.\nWe talked with Albert, we talked again with Party Secretary Zhang, and\nwe talked with Dean Fu and other English department faculty members. We\nsaid that tennis was very expensive, and I didn’t know how to play it, and in\nfact Adam didn’t even like it anymore. He had outgrown it in college and if\nanything he was looking forward to having a nice long break from tennis. It\nwas a lousy game. Basketball was much better, and so was soccer. Tennis\nwas a game of the exploiting classes. Actually, we never went quite that far,\nbut we tried everything else, and for a week we campaigned steadily against\nthe buying of tennis.\n\nNext to our apartment building was a croquet court. It was without a\ndoubt the nicest spot on campus, and perhaps it was the most peaceful patch\nof earth I ever saw in China. In a crowded country there weren’t many places\nlike that—a spot where the land was used for nothing but enjoyment. A ring\nof trees shaded the borders, and the packed dirt surface was perfectly smooth.\nIt was well tended, but mostly it was smooth and beautiful because it was\nwell played. Every morning, the retired teachers and workers in the college\nmet in the croquet court, where they played all day long, with a break for\nlunch. They were impossibly good. They were so good that it almost didn’t\nseem competitive—the ball went where it was intended to go, the way a\nmagician’s cards move according to the silent harmony of routine and skill. It\nwas a daily exhibition, a game of trick shots; the retirees were artists—they\nhad taken croquet to an entirely new level. And the whole affair was almost\nthe exact same size as a tennis court.\nFor the first few weeks that was our great fear. Our balconies overlooked\nthe court, and every morning we gazed out, afraid to see workers, shovels,\npicks, backhoes, dynamite—whatever was involved in the buying of tennis,\nwe were deeply and sincerely afraid of it. The uncertainty was the worst part;\nit seemed an abstract notion, to buy tennis, but at the same time Fuling was\nclearly the sort of place where a great deal of work could be put into turning\nthe abstract into reality. A glance at the plans for the Three Gorges Dam was\nenough to prove that.\nBut in the end tennis was not bought in Fuling. The banquets ended after\nfour weeks. Within a month the college stopped buying things for our\napartments. It wasn’t long before we were complaining like spoiled children\nthat our needs were neglected, but we grumbled lightly and to ourselves, high\nabove campus in our cadres’ apartments.\nTHE CROQUET SOUNDS drifted up to my apartment in the mornings—\nthe gentle knock of the ball, the sound of shuffled footsteps on hard dirt, the\nsoft chatter and laughter of the retirees as they played without hurry. These\nwere some of the most soothing sounds I had ever heard, and often I sat out\non my balcony and simply listened, the croquet sounds backed by the\nunsteady hum of the cicadas and the noise of the Wu River. Boat horns\n\nechoed across the narrow river valley, and motors sputtered against the\ncurrent, and barges clanked as they unloaded sand onto rumbling trucks at the\nwater’s edge. A mile from my apartment, the Wu died in the brown rush of\nthe Yangtze, and often I could hear a lonely horn booming out from the big\nriver.\nAt the beginning, Fuling was mostly sounds to me. It was a loud city, but\nalso the noises were different from anything I had known before—the steady\nclinking of chisels at construction sites, the crush of rock broken with a\nsledgehammer: these were the sounds of a place where much of the work was\nstill done by hand. And it was the first time I had lived next to a river,\nlistening to the boat noises and the way they echoed up and down the valley.\nMy apartment was on the top floor of a building high on a hill above the\nWu River. It was a pretty river, fast and clean, and it ran from the wild\nsouthern mountains of Guizhou province. Across the Wu River was the main\ncity of Fuling, a tangle of blocky concrete buildings rising up the hillside.\nEverywhere I looked, the hills were steep, especially due north, where the\nheavy shape of White Flat Mountain loomed sheer above the junction of the\ntwo rivers.\nThat was the view from my aerie—high on the sixth floor, far above the\nrivers and their town. Nothing blocked my view, which was another reason I\nheard so much. Long before the croquet sounds began every morning, I heard\nthe rooster behind the building start to crow, and I heard the morning alarm\ngo off all over campus at six o’clock. I heard the students as they jogged\ngroggily to the small road that ran through campus, where they did their\nmorning exercises. The exercise music started shortly after six, broadcast\nover the loudspeakers—morning—cheerful, workout-repetitive music, the\nsame day after day. After exercises there were announcements, and\npropaganda, and the sound of students getting their breakfast; and then there\nwere the bells for morning class and the first soft echoes rising up from the\ncroquet court.\nI lived next to the main teaching building and I heard those sounds as\nwell. I heard students repeating their lessons, because in Fuling much was\nlearned by rote. That was also a soothing sound; there was something\nsatisfying about hearing their voices rise and fall in unison as they recited\nlessons that all of them had learned. And I liked hearing the teachers’ voices\nonce class started, and the jumbled noise of the ten-minute breaks, and the\n\nelectronic bells and the eager rush of the lunch hour.\nNone of these noises bothered me. The early sounds woke me but that\nwas fine, because they were part of the routine of the college and hearing\nthem made me feel as if I were also in step. I wasn’t, of course—and in some\nways I never fell in. But during those early weeks I would have felt even\nmore disjointed if it hadn’t been for the steady routines that surrounded me.\nEverything followed a strict timetable. There was the morning routine—\nthe exercises, the bells, the classes—and often in the afternoons there was the\nwhisk of brooms as the students did their mandatory campus cleaning. On\nMondays and Thursdays they cleaned their classrooms. Sunday nights were\npolitical meetings, when the students gathered to give speeches and sing\nsongs. Sometimes they sang patriotic anthems, but mostly they sang love\nsongs, their voices echoing across the nighttime campus.\nAt the start of the year, the freshmen had military training. Each class\nformed a regiment, boys and girls together, and People’s Liberation Army\nsoldiers came to teach them how to salute, goose-step, execute turns, and\nstand at attention. During their military training they also learned songs—that\nseemed to be a way to make Communism fun. Our students were always\nsinging patriotic songs for one organization or another.\nFor their military training, the freshmen wore the class uniform, which\nconsisted of powder-blue Adidas-knockoff sweat suits. Their bright uniforms\nseemed incongruous next to the military stiffness of the camouflaged\ninstructors, and so did the students. They were in their early twenties but\nmost looked younger, fresh off the farm, and they cowered under the leaders’\ninstructions. On hot days some of them fainted and were carried to the shade\nwhile the rest of the class continued goose-stepping. At the end of the two-\nweek training, when they had their steps down, they marched out to the rifle\nrange in a deep corner of Mo Pan Valley, where, as a punctuation to their\ninitiation, they blew the hell out of targets with high-powered rifles. I heard\nthat as well, the bursts of gunfire drowning out the sounds of the Wu River.\nCampus quieted early at night. The dormitory lights went out at eleven\no’clock sharp—all of them at once, a row of buildings going black as the\nelectricity was cut. Sometimes I sat out on my balcony at night, watching the\nlights go out, and again there was something soothing about the regularity of\nit all.\nFrom my balcony the city was beautiful at night. During the day Fuling\n\nwas a dirty river town, and you could see that much of it had been built too\nquickly, but at night all of the flaws disappeared. It was only water and lights\n—the brilliant lights and the dark water, the deep black mirror of the Wu\nRiver streaked with red and yellow and white. Sometimes a night boat\nslipped upriver, steadily pushing a triangle of light ahead of its prow, the\nmotor coughcoughcoughing in the darkness of the valley. And every half\nhour or so there would be a big passenger boat on the Yangtze, a bright band\nof lights floating past in majestic silence.\nI didn’t really understand any of the routines. I didn’t know where the\nboats were going and I didn’t know why the college was regulated the way it\nwas. They played croquet differently than we do in America, but I never\nbothered to figure out the Fuling rules. I simply liked their playing every day\n—the regularity was what mattered. Nor did I ever think much about the\nmilitary training, until I read one of my students’ journal as she described a\ntypical afternoon in the college:\nIt’s sunny, the first year students are doing their military training.\nThey walked again and again. Although the sweat is dropping down\nfrom their head, they can’t stop without the permission of their leader.\nOf course, in this way, they know how hard the army life is. Their\nspirits can be discouraged.\nEveryone should have a strong sense of patriotism, especially the\ncollege students. Our state costs a lot of money to educate them. They\nshould be faithful to their motherland. Army force is a symbol of the\npower of a country, so it’s necessary to have some knowledge about\nmilitary. In 1989, there was a student movement in Beijing. For the\nyouth, their thoughts don’t ripe and they don’t have their own ideas, so\nthe surroundings can influence them easily. Also they can’t tell the truth\nfor the fault. Where there is exciting thing, they turn up. After the\nmovement, our state decides to have military training in college, to make\nthem understand that it is not easy to obtain our present life.\nThat was what I had actually been hearing—the marching and the distant\ngunshots were the echoes of the Tiananmen Square protests. I realized that\n\nthere was more to the routines of the college than I had first imagined, and\nafter that I began to listen more carefully to the sounds that filtered up to my\naerie high above the Wu River.\nMUCH OF WHAT I LEARNED in the early days was from the students.\nMy Chinese wasn’t yet good enough to talk with the people in town, which\nmade the city overwhelming—a mess of miscommunication. And so I\nlistened to my students, reading what they wrote in their journals for class,\nand parts of Fuling slowly began to draw into focus.\nThe first thing I saw was myself and Adam. This was intimidating,\nbecause never in my life had I been watched so closely that every action was\nreplayed and evaluated. Everything we did was talked and written about;\nevery quirk or habit was laid bare. Students wrote about the way I always\ncarried a water bottle to class; they wrote about how I paced the classroom as\nI taught; they wrote about my laugh, which they found ridiculous. They wrote\nabout my foreign nose, which impressed them as impossibly long and\nstraight, and many of them wrote about my blue eyes. This was perhaps the\nstrangest detail of all, because my eyes are hazel—but my students had read\nthat foreigners had blue eyes, and they saw what they wanted to see.\nMostly they wanted to see all of the outside world condensed into these\ntwo young waiguoren, which was what foreigners were called in Fuling\n—“people from outside the country.” One afternoon, Adam and I threw a\nFrisbee around the front plaza after dinner, and by the next day, when I read\none student’s journal, the lazy game had become Olympian:\nWhen I was writing my composition, someone shouted at the classes:\n‘Pete and Adam are playing Frisbee!’ At once, I put down my pen and\nrushed out the classroom. Really, they are! I wanted to see it clearly and\ndidn’t want to miss any scene. I ran into the classroom and put the\nglasses on my nose, then dashed to the classroom again. I can see it\nclearly now!…The two sports men stood far away from Frisbee each\nother and began to play. How wonderful it looked! The Frisbee was like\na red fire, flying person to person between the two men. I have seen it\nfor a long time. Foreigners are so versatile.\n\nOther descriptions were less heroic. My favorite was written by a student\nnamed Richard, in an essay entitled “Why Americans Are So Casual”:\nI’m a Chinese. As we all know, the Chinese nation is a rather\nconservative nation. So many of us have conservative thinking in some\ndegree. I don’t know whether it is bad or good.\nOur foreign language teachers—Peter and Adam—came to teach us\nthis term. It provides a good opportunity of understanding the American\nway of life. In my opinion, they are more casual than us Chinese people.\nWhy do I think so? I’ll give you some facts to explain this.\nFor example, when Mr. Hessler is having class, he can scratch himself\ncasually without paying attention to what others may say. He dresses up\ncasually, usually with his belt dropping and dangling. But, to tell you the\ntruth, it isn’t consider a good manner in China, especially in old people’s\neyes. In my opinion, I think it is very natural.\nLast week, when Miss Thompson [another Peace Corps volunteer who\nvisited Fuling] gave us a lecture on the American election, she took off\nher woolen sweater and tied it to her waist. To us Chinese people, it’s\nalmost unimaginable. How can a teacher do that when she/he is having a\nlesson! But thanks goodness, we major in English and know something\nabout America, it didn’t surprise us. But if other people saw this, they\nmight can’t believe their own eyes.\nIt was an easy place to make mistakes, and plenty were made. But the\nlocals tended to be forgiving—usually they gave us a hint, a nudge in the\nright direction. During the first week of class, Adam had his students\nintroduce themselves, and a girl named Keller stood up. She told the name of\nher hometown, and she explained that she had chosen her English name in\nhonor of Helen Keller. This was a common pattern; some of them had taken\ntheir names from people they admired, which explained why we had a\nBarbara (from Barbara Bush), an Armstrong (Neil Armstrong), and an\nidealistic second-year student called Marx. A few had translated their\nChinese names directly—House, Yellow, North. There was one boy whose\n\nEnglish name was Lazy. “My name is Lazy,” he said, on the first day of\nclass. “I am very lazy. I do not like to play basketball or football or do many\nthings. My hobbies are sleeping.”\nOther names made less sense. There was a Soddy, a Sanlee, a Ker. Some\nwere simply unfortunate: a very small boy called Pen, a very pretty girl\nnamed Coconut. One boy was called Daisy, a name that greatly dismayed\nDean Fu. The dean was a handsome man with blue-black hair, and he was\nour main liaison with the English department—a position whose weight of\nresponsibility often gave him a mournful air. He seemed particularly morose\nwhen he called me into his office to talk about Daisy.\n“That’s a girl’s name, isn’t it?” Dean Fu asked.\n“Yes,” I said. “Except now in America even girls don’t like that name.”\n“I remember it from The Great Gatsby,” Dean Fu said, smiling sadly. As\na student his specialty had been American literature, and he was familiar with\nvirtually all of the great twentieth-century novelists. He sighed and shook his\nhead.\n“Last year that student had a boy’s name,” said the dean. “He changed it\nover the summer. I don’t know why.”\nI didn’t know either—I never talked with Daisy about it. He wasn’t easy\nto speak with, and all I ever learned about him was that his lifelong goal of\nbeing a soldier had been crushed when the People’s Liberation Army turned\nhim down because of bad eyesight. This was a failure that illuminated the\nmystery of Daisy’s existence; he was a tall, taciturn boy with an air of deep\nsadness, and every day he wore a full camouflage uniform to class. Whether\nit was consolation or a form of self-punishment, I never knew. I simply liked\nhaving a tall camouflaged boy named Daisy sitting in the back of my class,\nand I never would have asked him to change either his name or his uniform. I\ndidn’t tell that to Dean Fu, of course.\nBut Keller’s name was very straightforward. Helen Keller was a common\nheroine among the students—even some of the boys listed her as a role\nmodel, partly because she had had Communist sympathies. On the day that\nKeller introduced herself, she explained the reasons for her name, and then\nshe smiled.\n“Thank you,” Adam said. “You have very nice freckles, Keller.”\nThe classroom suddenly became very still. Keller’s face fell and she sat\ndown quickly. In the awkward silence Adam floundered for a moment, and\n\nthen he hurriedly explained that in America freckles are considered attractive.\nWhich, it turned out, is not the case in China—his compliment was like\nsaying “You have a nice birthmark.” But there was nothing to do except\ncontinue the lesson, and in a few minutes the awkwardness had passed.\nBut it wasn’t forgotten. A week later two students mentioned the incident\nin their journals, trying, in the Chinese way, to communicate the message\nindirectly:\nI have heard of that there are so many American women have freckles\non their faces. In China, women especially girls who have freckles on\ntheir faces do not like other people to mention it. It’s bad manner. I want\nto know what do the American women who have freckles think of it?\nSome of their [the foreign teachers’] teaching methods are\nacceptable…. We should affirm their achievements. But sometimes they\nalso make some students embarassed due to their absence of Chinese\ncustom. We Chinese have our own taboos. We never make frivolous\nremarks about people’s appearanc. But one of these two American\nteachers broke this taboo once in class. But I think, with the time on, up\ntheir knowledge of Chinese daily life, would some embarransements be\navoided.\nAND SO WE BUMBLED ON. We were naive, of course—we trusted good\nintentions and hard work, and we thought that soon we would slip into the\nroutines of the city without much problem. But like most parts of the country,\nFuling had a complicated past, and I had no real understanding of this history,\nregardless of how many books I had read about the Great Leap Forward and\nthe Cultural Revolution.\nMore specifically, I didn’t recognize what it meant for this particular part\nof China to finally have American residents. Later I would learn that much of\nthe local industry had been moved here from Shanghai as a direct result of\nthe American nuclear threat in the 1950s and 1960s, when Mao Zedong\n\ndispersed China’s military factories throughout the remote mountains of the\nsouthwest. It was inevitable that such a past would have some effect on the\nway locals viewed us, but we knew nothing about this chapter in history.\nProbably it would have been harder if we had known more. One of my\nfavorite students was a girl named Anne, whose family lived on the ground\nfloor of our building. Her father was a math professor, the highest-ranking\nfaculty member on campus, and this was an honor that had earned him a\nplace in our exclusive building. It had also earned him a job in a remote\nSichuan coal mine for eight years of the Cultural Revolution. Like so many\nother talented Chinese, he had been banished as an intellectual, or chou\nlaojiu, “the Old Stinking Ninth”, the lowest of the low, the ones who could be\nsaved only by the basest and most tedious labor.\nThose years seemed to sit lightly on Professor Liang—he was a cheerful\nman, undoubtedly happy to have been politically rehabilitated. Even in the\ncoal mine he had made the best of the situation, winning the locals’\nadmiration by showing them how to balance their accounts. But I thought that\nperhaps the past had somehow affected his daughter more, even though she\nhad not lived through his experience. She was one of the brightest students in\nthe class, and also one of the few who stood apart. Her ideas were different—\nshe liked being alone, and she made up her own mind; she was capable of\nveering away from the political cant that most of them rehashed. Of all my\nstudents, I expected her to be the most open-minded to me as a foreigner.\nAnd yet after her graduation she wrote a letter and explained honestly how it\nhad been at the beginning:\nNot long after you became my teacher, I read a piece of old news\ncomment that said Mr. Clinton took presidency, one of the reasons [why\nthe Americans had elected him] was that he would take stronger\nmeasure on China. Those days, I hated to see you and Mr. Meier.\nIn the first few months I never would have guessed that such feelings\nwere so strong, although there were occasional signs that my students still\nviewed the outside world with mistrust. I treated these moments as isolated\nincidents—I responded, usually gently, and then I tried to think no more\n\nabout it. One day a female student named Catherine wrote about the\ndifferences between women in the East and the West:\nPeople in the west like the girl who is elegant or the girl who is\nsexuality? But I always heard a view that girl in the east is famous for\nher elegance and the girl in the west is famous for her sexuality.\nThe girls in China, most of them are elegant, refined, and kind. They\nalways do something following rules. It’s the Chinese tradition.\nBut the girls in the west are very open to outside. They can marry\nanyone and get divorced whenever. Don’t mind the appraise of others.\nThey can do everything that she wants to do, not concern about whether\nit’s wrong or right. They lead a loose life.\nI think I like the statue and virtue of the girl in the east. They are\nelegant, refined.\nCatherine was a lovely girl, a quiet student with eager eyes and a friendly\nsmile, and I couldn’t be harsh. Below her journal entry, I simply wrote that in\nAmerica I had three sisters—and I left it at that. In Fuling that sort of\ncommunication was enough; a day later she apologized.\nShe wrote about being “open,” which was a watershed issue for the\npeople in Fuling, and, in turn, for all of China. People everywhere talked\nabout Gaige Kaifang, Reform and Opening, which included both increased\ncontact with the outside world and the Capitalist-style economic reforms that\nDeng Xiaoping had initiated in 1978. To a certain degree, Reform and\nOpening was similar to the Russian concepts of Perestroika and Glasnost,\nwith one critical difference: the Chinese term lacked an explicit political\ncomponent, as the country’s leaders had no intention of opening the political\nsystem in the manner of Gorbachev. Nevertheless, Reform and Opening\nresulted in massive social changes, ranging from increased mobility between\nregions to new styles and attitudes that were influenced by foreign cultures.\nMost Chinese people saw these as positive developments, because they were\naccompanied by rising living standards, but there were still quiet fears that\nlurked in people’s minds. And simply having the first American teachers in\nFuling was enough to trigger these uncertainties.\n\nI was too overwhelmed to dwell on such matters during that first\nsemester. I was studying Chinese, preparing lessons, and writing in my\njournal; I didn’t have time to worry about the political implications of our\narrival. But still there were moments that shook me—like the time I read part\nof an entry in a student journal, three short sentences that echoed in my mind\nlong after the grading was finished:\nToday’s China has been opened to the foreign countries. The\ncriminals have been increased. It’s important to maintain public order.\nNONE OF THAT seemed too important in the early months. I copied the\ninteresting remarks in my journal, and then I moved on. I sensed that I simply\ncouldn’t judge the students for anything they thought, at least in the\nbeginning. Their backgrounds were too far removed from what I had known\nbefore coming to Fuling, and, like all young Chinese, they were surrounded\nby the aura of a troubled past. It was easy to forget this—it was easy to laugh\nat their ridiculous names, or smile at their childlike shyness, and it was easy\nto dismiss them as simple young people from the simplicity of the\ncountryside. But of course nothing was farther from the truth—the Sichuan\ncountryside is not simple, and my students had known things that I had never\nimagined. Even if appearances were deceiving, the truth always came through\nin the way they wrote about their homes and families:\nIn real life, I think my father is a hero. Once he told us his past. When\nhe was about ten years old, his elder brother and sisters had been\nmarried and worked far from home. At that time, China was following a\nroad of collectivization, and people were taking a collective productive\nlabour. They couldn’t have their own property.\nBefore those days, my grandparents made a lot of property through\nhard work, but when the collective productive labour began, the\nproperty of my family were all destroyed by the “revolution group.”\nThey said all things belonged to the public, then they took some good\nthings away. My grandma wanted to stop them, but failed. They hanged\nup and beat her and refused to give her something to eat. Later she died\n\nfrom starving, then they forced my father to weed in water field in\nwinter. My father didn’t complain, just worked hard.\nMost of their grandmothers had had bound feet; few of their grandfathers\nhad been able to read. Their parents had come of age during one of the most\nhorrible periods in Chinese history. All of this affected my students and\nshaped who they were, but at the same time they were something entirely\ndifferent. They were educated, and although few of them had much money,\nthey weren’t desperately poor. They could buy things—fashionable clothes,\nbooks, radios. They went to college. They had studied English for seven\nyears. They had seen great changes, both political and economic. Perhaps by\nmy standards they were politically brainwashed, but compared to the past\nthey were remarkably free.\nThey were a watershed generation, in the same way that “opening” was a\nwatershed issue for China. I sensed that a great deal depended on the people\nof this age group—in some ways it was like the American generation of my\nparents, who grew up on stories of the Depression and World War II, and\nwho built the America of today, for better or worse. There was the same\nsense of future glory in China, but the past was far more brutal than anything\nthat had ever happened in America, which complicated things. My students\nhad difficulty criticizing anything Chinese, and this was not surprising,\nbecause they were constantly being indoctrinated by the Communist Party.\nOccasionally some of my better students wrote about China with a mixture of\ncool accuracy and blind optimism that gave me some sense of how wonderful\nand difficult it was to be a young Chinese:\nI think, in the history of the People’s Republic of China, there are two\ngreat men: Mao Zedong and Deng Xiaoping. We should mention the\ntwo men if we want to point out the difference between two generations’\nviews on China.\nWhen my parents were at my age, China wasn’t rich. Even the people\ncouldn’t live the type of dressing warmly and eating there fill. The\nsituation was very hard at that time. Because of lack of experience, the\nleaders of China didn’t solve some questions very well. Maybe, that\n\nperiod was the hardest within the progress of China. But, there is a fact\nthat is beyond all question: it was Mao Zedong and his comrades that\nfounded the People’s Republic of China, and brought the Chinese people\nindependence and democracy which is a long cherished goal for the\nChinese. So, people admired him from the bottom of their heart. This\nkind of admiration led to people’s profound love to China to a great\nextent. My parents did the same. It was the Great Cultural Revolution\nthen; there were many wrong things in life. But they thought China was\nthe best and perfect country and had splendid position. In their minds,\nChina would reach its great goal only by performing planned economy\nbecause it was a socialist country. Anything about market economy was\nRight deviation. My parents only did what they were ordered to do and\ndidn’t consider whether they were true or false.\nToday, when we see those days with our own sight, we’ll feel our\nparents’ thoughts and actions are somewhat blind and fanatical. But if\nwe consider that time objectly, I think, we should understand and can\nunderstand them. Each generation has its own happiness and sadness. To\nyounger generation, the important thing is understanding instead of\ncriticising. Our elder generation was unlucky; they didn’t own a good\nchance and circumstances to realize their value. But, their spirit, their\nlove to our country set a good example for us.\nIT WAS HARD for me to imagine a better job. My students were eager and\nrespectful, and they were bright. The college was not prestigious, but in\nChina less than 2 percent of the population attend any schooling beyond high\nschool, which meant that even Fuling’s students were a very select group. In\nfact I was glad to be at a lower-level school, because there was an unpolished\nquality to the students that I had never seen before. Everywhere else I had\nbeen, education rounded off the edges much earlier—in America, even high\nschool students were cagey, cynical, suspicious. Education was a game and\nstudents played it, but in Fuling they hadn’t yet reached that point. Their\nintelligence was still raw—it smelled of the countryside, of sweat and muck,\nof night soil and ripening rapeseed and everything else that composed the\nSichuanese farmland. And in their thoughts were flashes of the land, glimpses\nof the same sort of hard beauty that surrounded the teachers college, where\n\nthe campus ended in terraced fields that ran steep up the side of Raise the\nFlag Mountain.\nIt shone through brightly in some of them. We had one student named\nKer—like so many of the students’ English names, his was a puzzle. He was\none of the quietest boys in class and he looked like a middle-aged peasant:\nshort, stocky, his face tanned and weathered by the Sichuan sun. He had a\npeasant’s quiet smile, and a peasant’s modest politeness, and he had been a\npeasant until the day the government sent a letter informing him that his\nexamination scores had won him admission to Fuling Teachers College. Now\nhe was twenty-one years old, the youngest student in his section, and one day\nAdam assigned a fifteen-minute free writing. Ker put his head down and\nwrote:\nI’m working in the fields. The ox suddenly becomes a machine with\nan ox head. So I finish my task ahead of time. Because of that I am\nrecommended to be the leader of our town. Then I go to Beijing by air to\nreport my deeds to President Jiang Zemin. He doesn’t believe it’s true,\nbecause he’s never seen a machine with an ox head. He orders that I be\nsent to prison. On my way to prison, my ox appears. It becomes a train\nwith an ox head and…\nMy fortune and my changing ox is closely connected.\nFortunately I get back with the help of the train-like ox. I go into the\ntown government office. The ox, now it is really an ox, follows me and\nmurmurs something. I can’t catch what it said. It turns into a computer\nwhich looks like an ox head. The screen shows: My young master, you\nare not suitable for politics. What you should do now is to go to school\nto learn more knowledge. Especial your English is too poor. Only in this\nway can you do your job better and live a more happy life….\nPerhaps for the ox’s advice I will abandoned farmwork for study.\nThere was a great deal of Sichuan in those two hundred words, and yet it\nseemed so effortless—but of course there was more to it than met the eye.\nThe first time Adam had assigned a free writing, it had not gone according to\nplan. He explained to the class that they would have fifteen minutes, and then\n\nhe told them to “write about anything you want.”\nThe students wrote. At the end of the hour Adam collected their papers.\nThey had written about anything they wanted, and what he had was forty-five\nshopping lists. I want a new TV, a new dress, a new radio. I want more\ngrammar books. I want my own room. I want a beeper and a cell phone and a\ncar. I want a good job. Some of the students had lists a full page long, every\nentry numbered and prioritized.\nIt wasn’t exactly what Adam had intended, but nevertheless there was a\ngreat deal of Sichuan in those lists as well. The next time, Adam explained\nvery carefully that they should “write about any subject you want to write\nabout.”\nThat worked better. Ker put his head down and wrote. And Adam and I\nkept plugging away, learning from our mistakes and trying to fit into the local\nroutines.\n\nTHE CITY\nTHERE ARE NO BICYCLES in Fuling. Otherwise it is similar to any\nother small Chinese city—loud, busy, dirty, crowded; the traffic twisted, the\npedestrians jostling each other; shops overstaffed and full of goods, streets\ncovered with propaganda signs; no traffic lights, drivers honking constantly;\ntelevisions blaring, people bickering over prices; and along the main streets\nrows of frightened-looking trees, their leaves gray with coal dust, the same\ngray dust that covers everything in the city.\nThere are no bicycles because Fuling is full of steps, and the city is full of\nsteps because it is squeezed close on the mountains that press against the\njunction of the Wu and Yangtze Rivers. Narrow streets also rise from the\nriverbanks, switchbacking up the hills, but they are cramped and indirect and\ntoo steep for bicycles. Automobile traffic tangles on the sharp corners. And\nso the long stone staircases are the true boulevards of Fuling, carrying most\nof its traffic—shoppers descending the stairs, pausing to browse in stores;\nporters climbing up, shoulders bowed under the weight of crates and bundles.\nVirtually every necessary good or service can be found along these\nstairways and their landings. There are shops and restaurants, cobblers and\nbarbers. One of the lower stairways is lined with Daoist fortune-tellers.\nAnother staircase is home to a group of three dentists who work at a table\ncovered with rusty tools, syringes in mysterious fluids, and pans of cruelly\ndefeated teeth—a sort of crude advertisement. Sometimes a peasant will stop\nto have his tooth pulled, after haggling over the price, and a crowd will gather\nto watch. Everything is public. A haircut comes with an audience. The price\nof any purchase is commented on by the other shoppers who pause as they\npass. For medical problems one can sit in the open air and see a traditional\nChinese physician, who has a regular stand near the top of one of the\nstairways. His stand consists of a stool, a box of bottles, and a white sheet\nwith big characters that say:\n\nTo Help You Relieve Worries and Solve Problems! Particular\nTreatments: Corns, Sluggishness, Black Moles, Ear Checks. Surgery—\nNo Pain, No Itching, No Bloodletting, No Effects on Your Job!\nFuling is not an easy city. Old people rest on the staircases, panting. To\ncarry anything up the hills is backbreaking work, and so the city is full of\nporters. They haul their loads on bamboo poles balanced across their\nshoulders, the same way freight was carried in the south of China in the\n1800s, when the English referred to such laborers as “coolies”—from the\nChinese kuli, or “bitter strength.” Here in Fuling, as in all of the eastern\nSichuan river towns, the porters are called Bang-Bang Jun—the Stick-Stick\nArmy. They have uniforms (the simple blue clothes of the Chinese\npeasantry), and the weapons of their trade (bamboo poles and loops of cheap\nrope), and they tend to gather in packs, in companies, in battalions. To\nbargain with one stick-stick soldier is to bargain with a regiment. Their jobs\nare difficult enough without cutthroat competition, and they look out for each\nother; there is no formal union but the informal bond of hard labor is much\ncloser. During midday, when most people rest, the stick-stick soldiers can be\nseen along the midtown streets, sitting on their poles, smoking, chatting,\nplaying cards; and in their leisure there is an air not so much of relaxation as\nof a lull in the battle.\nMost of them are peasants who have farms in the mountains outside of\nFuling, and usually there is a wife or a brother tending the land while they try\ntheir luck carrying loads on the docks. There is always an especially heavy\nflood of stick-stick soldiers during the winter, because that is the light season\nin the countryside. But never is there any shortage of these men, and there is\nsomething eerie in their silent ubiquity. They stand five deep in front of\ntelevision stores, staring at the wall of screens. If a foreigner eats at a\nstreetside stand, ten stick-stick soldiers will gather to watch. If there is an\nargument on the docks, they will cluster close, all of them dressed in blue,\nholding their bamboo poles and listening intently. Occasionally a small\nvariety show will stop in Fuling and pitch its tent on the river flats, fronted by\nan advertisement featuring more or less undressed dancing girls, and\n\ninvariably there is a lost regiment of stick-stick soldiers gaping at the\nmarquee. An auto accident is not truly an auto accident unless a company of\nstick-stick soldiers arrives to gaze at the damage. They are quiet men—even\nthe most grisly wreck sometimes fails to inspire them to words—and they\nnever interfere. They simply watch.\nBut to see them work is to understand why they so often rest, because in a\nhard city there is no harder job. For a load they generally make one or two\nyuan—there are slightly more than eight yuan to the American dollar—and\nroutinely these workers carry more than one hundred pounds up the\nstaircases. They are short, stocky men, their bodies shaped by the hilly city\nand the nature of their work. In summer, when they go without shirts, you can\nsee where the bamboo poles have burnished the skin along their shoulders\nlike leather. In hot weather they are drenched in sweat; in winter their bodies\nsteam. Below rolled-up trousers their calves bulge as if baseballs have been\ntied to the backs of their legs.\nFuling is a city of legs—the gnarled calves of a stick-stick soldier, the\nbowed legs of an old man, the willow-thin ankles of a xiaojie, a young\nwoman. You watch your step when climbing the stairways; you keep your\nhead down and look at the legs of the person in front of you. It is possible,\nand very common, to spend a morning shopping in Fuling and never once\nlook up at the buildings. The city is all steps and legs.\nAnd many of the buildings are not worth looking at. There is still an old\nsection along the banks of the Wu River, where beautiful ancient structures of\nwood and stone are topped by gray tiled roofs. But this district is shrinking,\nsteadily being replaced by the nondescript modern buildings that already\ndominate the city. There are a few tall ones, seven or more stories, but they\nare cheaply made of blue glass and white tile like so many new structures in\nChina. And even if you built a beautiful new building in Fuling, it would\nquickly fade beneath the gray layers of dust.\nThe city is different from the land in that, apart from the small old\ndistrict, there is no sense of the past. To travel through the Sichuan\ncountryside is to feel the history, the years of work that have shaped the land,\nthe sheer weight of humanity on patches of earth that have been worked in\nthe same way for centuries. But Sichuanese cities are often timeless. They\nlook too dirty to be new, and too uniform and ugly to be old. The majority of\nFuling’s buildings look as if they were dropped here about ten years ago,\n\nwhile in fact the city has existed on the same site for more than three\nthousand years. Originally it was a capital of the Ba Kingdom, an\nindependent tribe that was conquered by the Chinese, and after that nearly\nevery dynasty left it with a different name, a different administrative center: it\nwas Jixian under the Zhou Dynasty, Fuling under the Han, Jixian under the\nJin, Hanping under the Northern Zhou, Liangzhou under the Sui, Fuzhou\nunder the Tang, Kuizhou under the Song, Chongqing under the Yuan and\nMing, Fuzhou under the Qing, Fuling under the Republic of China that was\nfounded in 1912.\nBut all of those dynasties have passed with hardly a mark left behind. The\nbuildings could be the buildings of any Chinese city whose development has\nswallowed its history. Their purpose is simply to hold people, the more than\n200,000 people who spend their days climbing the staircases, fighting the\ntraffic, working and eating, buying and selling.\nDAWN. A cool morning, the city covered in haze. Retirees practice taiji in\nthe small park near South Mountain Gate, the central intersection. Fuling is\nrelatively quiet—as quiet as it gets. There is a steady stream of traffic, and\nalready many of the drivers are honking their horns; but the roads are not\ncongested and the noise of the city is not yet overpowering. It is a pleasant\nmorning.\nThe retirees are lined up neatly in rows. A radio plays traditional Chinese\nmusic, and the old people move slowly, gracefully. The park is tiny—not so\nmuch a park as a lull in the city. There are stunned bushes and exhausted\nflowers and broken-hearted patches of grass. But all of it is well cared for—\nvandalism of public property is not a problem in Fuling. The problem is the\nair, the coal dust that blankets the city and chokes the greenery. Few things\nare more pathetic than a tree in Fuling, its leaves gray and dull as if it were\njust taken out of the attic.\nThe roar of the city rises as sunshine fills the haze in the eastern sky. It is\na mottled medley of sounds: honking horns, roaring television shops, blaring\ncassette tape stands, the uneven buzz of streetside salespeople calling out to\nthe passersby. East of South Mountain Gate there is a sudden reprieve, a\ncompletely different strain, the soft but piercing music of an erhu played by a\n\nblind man.\nErhu means “two strings”—that is all. It is a simple name for a simple\nmusical instrument: a cylindrical wooden sound box covered by python skin\nand topped by an upright handle with two strings stretched taut along its\nlength. It looks something like a crude two-stringed violin. But that pair of\nstrings has a rich soulful range and the erhu, played well, makes haunting\nmusic.\nToday the blind man is playing well. He is about forty years of age, but\nhis face looks older: tanned and creased, his eyes pinched shut. He wears\ndirty blue clothes and green army surplus sneakers. He sits on a low stool,\nand next to him is a cloth covered with poorly written characters. His nine-\nyear-old daughter stands nearby with a glass jar half full of money. A small\ncrowd has gathered, because the erhu’s music, despite the blaring horns and\nthe noise of rushing passersby, is powerful enough to make people stop and\nlisten. They read the words on the cloth:\nA Brief Story of a Household\nAt twenty years I was married, and at twenty-two I lost the sight of\nboth eyes. Eleven years after marriage I had a boy child, and then on\nDecember 2 of 1988 I had my second child, a daughter. My wife and I\nshared the care of the two children, tried to survive on the land of our\nhousehold. But our family was short of hands, and we had trouble,\nbecause grain and money were unreliable. The woman had to drag all of\nthese people behind her by the strength of her own effort, and indeed\nfinally she was unable to continue living. For this reason, we were\nforced to flee on January 8 of 1996.\nBecause of my two lost eyes, I was not able to live from day to day!\nOn March 2 of 1996 I was forced to send my son to live with his\nmother’s father. My son was fourteen years old, and without money we\ncould not send the boy to school. I hope that all of you uncles and aunts,\nfathers and mothers, brothers and sisters, will extend your warm hands\nto help me! My heart extends ten thousand thanks! I wish you success in\nyour work! Happiness and a long life!\n\nAbove all of this the erhu plays. Effortlessly the music rises and falls, the\nvoice flowing from the snakeskin-bound box, never drowned out by the\nrushing cars, the stream of pedestrians, the nearby televisions. At last the man\nstops. Gently he lays down the erhu and takes out his pipe. With his fingers\nhe feels the rough roll of tobacco, and then he calls for his daughter. She\nlights the pipe, carefully. The blind man inhales deeply and sits back to rest,\nsurrounded by the rising roar of the morning city.\n\nCHAPTER TWO\n\nShakespeare with Chinese Characteristics\nIN FULING I taught English and American literature. I also had classes in\nwriting and speaking, but most of my time was spent teaching lit. There were\ntwo sections of third-year students, and I taught each of them four hours a\nweek. Our textbooks started with Beowulf and continued through twelve\ncenturies and across the ocean to William Faulkner’s “A Rose for Emily.”\nIt was a great deal of ground to cover. The Peace Corps suggested that we\nnot be too ambitious with such courses, given our students’ backgrounds and\nthe fact that many of them had relatively low levels of English\ncomprehension. It was recommended that we use literature to introduce\nimportant grammatical points, but this was an idea I didn’t like. I knew that I\nwas an uninspired teacher of the language’s technical aspects, and I also\nknew that Shakespeare is an even worse grammar instructor than me. And I\nhad studied literature for too long to use it as a segue to the present perfect\ntense.\nBut I still had some concerns. The students, after all, were from the\ncountryside, and it was true that their English—and especially their spoken\nEnglish—was sometimes poor. On the first day of class I asked them to jot\ndown the titles of any English-language books they had read, either in the\noriginal or translation, and I asked what they would like to study in my\ncourse:\nI enjoyed Hai Ming Wei, The Old Man and the Sea. I mostly want to\nstudy Hai Ming Wei.\nI mostly want to study Helen Keller’s and Shakespeare’s work.\n\nI’ve read Jack London and his The Call of Wild, Dicken and his The\nTale of Two Cities, O. Henry and his The Last Leaf, Shakespeare and\nhis King Lear (and that made me burst into tears).\nI’m most interested in Jane Eyre by Charlotte Bronte. I don’t know\nwhich periods it belonged to. I like Jane. I think she is a very common\nwomen, but she has a uncommon seeking. She dared to resist wife of\nmother’s brother and brother of cousinship. She is a progressive lady.\nShakespeare was the greatest of all English authors. I had read some\nof his works. Romeo and Juliet is a dire story. Romeo and Juliet love\neach other. But there was revengefulness between their families.\nAnd I have read “Farewell, Weapons,” which was written by\nHemingway. He was a tough man, but he killed himself.\nI looked at their responses and thought: I can work with this. For the first\nweek I assigned them Beowulf.\nI TAUGHT on the fifth floor of the main teaching building. There were\nforty-five students to a class, all of them pressed close together behind old\nwooden desks. The room was their responsibility. They washed the\nblackboards between classes, and twice a week they cleaned the floor and\nwindows. If the cleaning wasn’t adequate, the class was fined. That was how\neverything worked at the college—students were fined for missing morning\n\nexercises, for skipping class, for failing examinations, for returning late to\ntheir dormitories at night. Very few of them had extra money to spend in this\nway, and so twice a week the classrooms were diligently and thoroughly\ncleaned.\nEach room contained about fifteen more students than could comfortably\nfit, and it would have been claustrophobic if I hadn’t been able to teach with\nthe door open. Fortunately, there was plenty of space outside—the\nclassrooms were high above the Wu River, the same view that I had from my\napartment’s balcony: the fast-running Wu, the jumbled city, the muddy\nYangtze and the dark shape of White Flat Mountain.\nThat was what I saw to my left as I taught, and at the beginning it was\ndistracting. But there was always a good breeze coming off the rivers, which\nkept the room from becoming unbearably hot. If things got quiet—if I had the\nclass doing a writing assignment, or if they were working smoothly in small\ngroups—I’d gaze out the door at the traffic on the rivers: the little two-man\nfishing sampans, the crowded ferries crossing from one bank to the other, the\nbarges bringing coal and gravel north from the upper Wu, the big white\ntourist boats slipping down the Yangtze toward the Gorges. There was\nsomething deeply satisfying about teaching with that view, and I liked\nwatching the routines of the city in the same way that I liked listening to the\nroutines of the college. During class I used to look down at the traffic\nteeming on the rivers, at all of the fishermen and barge captains and dock\nworkers, and I’d think: I’m working, too. The city was moving and I was a\nsmall part of it.\nAt the beginning we read very little from the literature textbooks, because\neven the summaries were difficult, but it wasn’t hard to get at the material\nfrom other angles. Often I told the stories, acting them out with reluctant\nstudents I grabbed as “volunteers,” and the classes loved this—in a country\nwhere foreigners were often put on television simply because they were\nwaiguoren, a room full of students was completely entranced by a foreigner\nperforming Gawain and the Green Knight. Other days I gave them writing\nassignments; for Beowulf we talked about point of view, and they wrote about\nthe story from the perspective of Grendel, the monster. Almost without\nexception the boys wrote about what it was like to eat people, and how to do\nit properly; while the girls wrote about how cold and dark the moor was, and\nhow monsters have feelings too. One student named Grace wrote:\n\nThe warriors said I am a monster, I can’t agree with them, but on the\ncontrary I think the warriors and the king are indeed monsters.\nYou see, they eat delicious foods and drinking every day. Where the\nfoods and drinking come from? They must deprive these things from\npeasants.\nThe king and the warriors do nothing but eat delicios foods; the\npeasants work hard every day, but have bad foods, even many of them\nhave no house to live, like me just live in the moor. So I think the world\nis unfair, I must change it.\nThe warriors, I hate them. I will punish them for the poor people. I\nwill ask the warriors build a large room and invited the poor people to\nlive with me.\nIn college I had been taught by a few Marxist critics, most of whom were\ntenured, with upper-class backgrounds and good salaries. They turned out\nplenty of commentary—often about the Body, and Money, and Exchange—\nbut somehow it didn’t have quite the same bite as Grace’s vision of Grendel\nas Marxist revolutionary. There was honesty, too—this wasn’t tweed\nMarxism; Grace, after all, was the daughter of peasants. She didn’t have\ntenure, and I had always felt that it was better if people who spoke feelingly\nof Revolution and Class Struggle were not tenured. And I figured that if you\nhave to listen to Marxist interpretations of literature, you might as well hear\nthem at a college where the students clean the classrooms.\nThe truth was that politics were unavoidable at a Chinese college, even if\nthe course was foreign literature, and in the end I taught English Literature\nwith Chinese Characteristics. We followed Gawain with a ballad about Robin\nHood, and I asked them to write a story about what would happen if Robin\nHood came to today’s China. A few followed the Party line:\nRobin Hood comes to and settles in China, leaving his own country.\nOn landing in the territory he is impressed by the peaceful country and\nfriendly, industrious Chinese. He knows that the bright pearl of the east\nis distinct from England in many aspects. Englishmen have no freedom,\n\nno rights. They are oppressed deep by their masters and exploiters and\nlive a dog’s life. Moreover, the gap between the rich and the poor is\nwidening. He hates such exploiting classes who lead a luxurious life\nbased on plundering the poor cruelly. But he does not seem to be\nadequate to overthrowing the rule.\nHowever, in China people are masters of the country, serving country\nis serving people. Some of the people are allowed to get wealthy first\nthrough honest and lawful labour [which] does not widen the gap\nbetween the rich and the poor, but leads the people to common\nprosperity. Robin Hood knows deeply the fact that it is unnecessary to\ntake something away from the rich by force as he did in England, but\nChina still needs justice and bravery. Cultural and ethical construction\nshould be fastened to development.\nBut most of them kept Robin Hood busy stealing from corrupt cadres and\ngreedy businessmen. Often they put him in the booming coastal regions, in\nShenzhen and Guangzhou and Xiamen, where reforms had freed the\neconomy and materialism was king. In their stories, Robin Hood stole from\nthe rich and gave to the peasants, and almost invariably he ended up in\nprison. Sometimes he was executed. One student had him successfully\nreeducated over a fifteen-year prison term (upon his release he became a\ndetective). But almost always Robin Hood was caught; there were no\nillusions about the idealized green world of Sherwood Forest. There are few\ntrees in China and the police always get their man.\nI had them debate about whether Robin Hood was a good role model for\ntoday’s China, which split them right down the middle. Some said that he\nwas like Mao Zedong, a revolutionary against injustice; they compared him\nto the heroes of the Long March and said that China would be nowhere\nwithout people like Robin Hood. Others answered that he was a Counter-\nRevolutionary, the sort of person who would stir up trouble and disturb the\neconomy. They pointed at what had happened during the Cultural Revolution\n—do you want constant Class Struggle with Robin Hood in the middle?\nWithin ten minutes they were no longer debating about Robin Hood.\nThey were arguing about China, and they were arguing about the political\ndogma with which all of them had been indoctrinated. Things quickly\n\nbecame heated. I sat in the back, listening to the mess of contrary ideas they\nhad been taught. Revolution was good—all of them knew that. Mao was a\nhero and the Long March had led to Liberation, which was the greatest\nmoment in Chinese history. But Counter-Revolution was bad—Tiananmen\nSquare protesters, pro-democracy activists; anything that agitated for change\nwas bad and against the Revolution. To be faithful to the Revolution, you\nshould support the status quo and the Communist Party—that was how you\nremained Revolutionary. Or was it? Robin Hood tangled them for an\nexhausting hour, every student speaking at least once, some of them angrily,\nand sitting in the back I wondered how you could ever make sense of it all.\nONE THING that I came to understand very early was that Fuling Teachers\nCollege served a dual purpose. It trained teachers, but like any Chinese\nschool it was also an educational extension of the Chinese Communist Party.\nEach Fuling student carried a red identity card at all times, and on the front\npage of the card were eight “Student Regulations.” The first three were as\nfollows:\n1. Ardently love the Motherland, support the Chinese Communist\nParty’s leadership, serve Socialism’s undertaking, and serve the\npeople.\n2. Diligently study Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought,\nprogressively establish a Proletariat class viewpoint, authenticate a\nviewpoint of Historical Materialism.\n3. Diligently study, work hard to master basic theory, career\nknowledge, and basic technical ability.\nIt wasn’t by accident that academic study came third. The top priority\nwas political: these students were being trained to be teachers, and as teachers\nthey would train China’s next generation, and all of this training was done\nwithin the framework of Chinese Communism. Everything else was\n\nsecondary—and if it contradicted basic theory, it wasn’t taught.\nFirst-year students of all departments studied Marxism-Leninism, and\nduring their second year they took a course in law. Third-year students\nstudied Building Chinese Socialism, oblivious that the city across the Wu,\nwith its booming private businesses and bankrupt state-owned enterprises,\nwas a testimony to the Dismantling of Chinese Socialism that was happening\nall across the country. This was the strangest part of it all, the way students\ncould study and believe in Communist courses while free-market\ncontradictions sprang up all around the college. And they did believe in what\nthey were taught—most of the students were patriotic and faithful in the way\nthey were trained to be. They took their political meetings and rallies\nseriously, and they coveted the chance to join the Communist Party. In every\nclass perhaps 10 percent would have that opportunity; in the English\ndepartment, there were eight Party Members out of ninety third-year students.\nThey were some of the best in the class—the brightest, the most talented, the\nmost socially adept.\nThe second rule, which emphasized their duty to “authenticate a\nviewpoint of Historical Materialism,” explained a great deal about how\npolitical theory worked in China. I never gained more than a vague\nunderstanding of what Historical Materialism means—it has something to do\nwith Class Struggle—but authenticating was the key. Not investigating, or\ncontemplating, or analyzing—simply authenticating. They did whatever was\nnecessary to prove the theories correct, ignoring complications and\ncontradictions, and in the process they carefully used the appropriate terms. A\nfew times I asked students to explain what some of these phrases meant—\nHistorical Materialism, the People’s Democratic Dictatorship, Socialism with\nChinese Characteristics—but they were never able to answer in clear and\nsimple language. It was, as Orwell would say, a case in which words and\nmeaning had parted company. All that mattered was that students used the\ncorrect terminology and the correct political framework as they viewed the\nworld around them.\nOften it was difficult to see exactly where Adam and I fit into this vision\nof education. Adam taught American Culture, which used an English-\nlanguage textbook entitled Survey of Britain and America. The book had\nbeen published in 1994, and often its portrait of America was hardly\nrecognizable—for example, the chapter on American religion didn’t mention\n\ncharities, communities, or schools, but said quite a bit about the Jonestown\nmass suicide. Another particularly vivid chapter was called “Social\nProblems.” Part of it read as follows:\nThe American society is developing very fast scientifically, while the\nspirit of the society is becoming more and more hollow, and the society\nitself more and more corrupted…. Many social scientists claim that\npremarital sexual relations were not unusual among both young men and\nyoung women before 1960’s. But what is different today is the open\nacceptance by many young people of a single standard for both sexes\nbefore marriage. Some Americans say this is only casual behavior;\nothers may find such an excuse that premarital relations are the natural\nresult of romantic love. This sounds even more ridiculous. The “new\nmorality” is nothing but “immorality.” This is the so-called “American\ncivilization.”\nHomosexuality is a rather strange social phenomenon that most people\ncan hardly understand. It widely spreads. One reason for this may be the\ndespair in marriage or love affairs. Some people fail in marriage and\nbecome disappointed with it. So they decide no longer to love the\nopposite sex, but instead begin to love a person of the same sex as a\nreturn of hatred to the opposite. Another reason may be that some people\njust want to find and do something “new” and “curious,” as the\nAmericans are known as adventurous. So they practised homosexuality\nas a kind of new excitement. Through this, we can see clearly the\nspiritual hollowness of these people and the distortion of the social\norder.\nThe chapter outlined a number of additional problems—racism, sexism,\ndrugs, religious fanaticism—and then it gave the fundamental reason for\nAmerica’s flaws:\nHowever, the most important reason is the capitalist system of\nAmerica. In this capitalist society, although science and technology is\nhighly advanced, some people are suffering from spiritual hollowness.\n\nThus they start to look for things curious and exciting. Therefore, only\nwhen the American capitalist system is ended, can all these social\nproblems be solved.\nIt was not an easy book to teach from. The biggest problem was\nseparating the wheat from the chaff: it was important to tell the students that\nthings like racism and sexism were indeed major problems in America, but at\nthe same time they needed to know that for many people homosexuality was\nnot an issue (and it was also good if they realized that Capitalism does not\ncause homosexuality). In the students’ minds, though, the book was either\ncorrect or it was wrong. There was no middle ground, and they had been\ntaught not to question official texts.\nTeaching as a foreigner was a matter of trying to negotiate your way\nthrough this political landscape. It was an acquired skill—over time, Adam\nand I gradually learned how to minimize the politics, to find subjects and\nways to approach them that didn’t trigger the standard knee-jerk reactions. It\nwas easier for me in literature class, especially when we started working on\npoetry, which simplified everything.\nBy rights it shouldn’t have been simple—the first poem we studied was\nShakespeare’s, and I didn’t make it particularly easy. I defined the form of a\nShakespearean sonnet and gave them Sonnet Eighteen in pieces, broken apart\nline by line. We reviewed poetic terms and archaic language, and I divided\nthem into groups and told them to put the poem in order. Even though I gave\nthem the first line, I figured it was an impossible task; my goal was simply to\nmake them struggle with the bare bones of the poem until its form felt\nsomewhat familiar. But they were never suspicious of impossible tasks,\nwhich was part of what made it so easy to teach in Fuling. The students\nwould work at anything without complaint, probably because they knew that\neven the most difficult literature assignment was preferable to wading knee-\ndeep in muck behind a water buffalo. And so the groups studied their broken\nsonnets while I gazed out at the sampans and barges on the Wu River.\nWithin an hour they had it. Some of the groups were merely close, but in\neach class there were two or three who nailed it:\n\nShall I compare thee to a summer’s day?\nThou art more lovely and more temperate.\nRough winds do shake the darling buds of May,\nAnd summer’s lease hath all too short a date.\nSometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,\nAnd often is his gold complexion dimmed;\nAnd every fair from fair sometimes declines,\nBy chance, or nature’s changing course, untrimmed;\nBut thy eternal summer shall not fade,\nNor lose possession of that fair thou ow’st,\nNor shall Death brag thou wand’rest in his shade,\nWhen in eternal lines to time thou grow’st.\nSo long as men can breathe or eyes can see,\nSo long lives this, and this gives life to thee.\nAnd they understood the form of the poem; just as they had put it\ntogether, they could take it apart. They could scan its rhythm—they knew\nwhere the stresses were in each line, and they could find the inconsistencies.\nThey read the poem to themselves and softly beat time on their desks. They\nheard the sonnet. This was something that few American students could do,\nat least in my experience. We didn’t read enough poetry to recognize its\nmusic, a skill that educated people lost long ago. But my students in Fuling\nstill had it—nothing had touched that ability, not the advent of television or\neven the pointed devastation of the Cultural Revolution.\nAs time went on it almost depressed me. The Chinese had spent years\ndeliberately and diligently destroying every valuable aspect of their\ntraditional culture, and yet with regard to enjoying poetry Americans had\narguably done a much better job of finishing ours off. How many Americans\ncould recite a poem, or identify its rhythm? Every one of my Fuling students\ncould recite at least a dozen Chinese classics by heart—the verses of Du Fu,\nof Li Bai, of Qu Yuan—and these were young men and women from the\ncountryside of Sichuan province, a backwater by Chinese standards. They\nstill read books and they still read poetry; that was the difference.\nVerse never seemed to bore or frustrate them. The only stumbling block\nwas language, the new vocabulary and the English archaisms, and with these\n\nthey had infinite patience. We reviewed Sonnet Eighteen carefully, until at\nlast we distilled it to the notion of poetic immortality, and I asked them: Was\nShakespeare successful? Did the woman live forever? Some of them shook\ntheir heads—it was four hundred years ago, after all—but others hesitated. I\nasked them where the woman had lived.\n“England,” said Armstrong, who answered most of my questions.\n“And when was that?”\n“Around 1600.”\n“Think about this,” I said. “Four centuries ago, Shakespeare loved a\nwoman and wrote a poem about her. He said he would make her beauty live\nforever—that was his promise. Today the year is 1996, and we are in China,\nin Sichuan, next to the Yangtze River. Shakespeare never came to Fuling.\nNone of you has ever been to England, and you have not seen the woman that\nShakespeare loved four hundred years ago. But right now every one of you is\nthinking about her.”\nThere was absolute silence. Usually Fuling was a riot of horns and\nconstruction projects, but at that moment in that classroom it was completely\nquiet. There was respect and awe in that silence, and I shared it. I had read\nthe poem countless times, but I had never heard it truly until I stood in front\nof my class in Fuling and listened to their stillness as they considered the\nmiracle of those fourteen lines.\nA moment later I asked them to describe what they saw in that silence,\nShakespeare’s woman through Chinese eyes:\nHer skin is as white as snow and as smooth as ice. Her long hair is like\nwaterfall; her eyes are so attractive you will never forget after you see\nher. She is plentiful, she is tall. Her little mouth as red as roses, and her\neyebrow is like the leaves of willow. Her fingers are so slender that\nscallions can’t compare with them.\nShe looks like a slim and graceful lotus that is beginning to blossom.\nHer long hair is like a waterfall. Her elbow is like a crescent moon. Her\nmouth is like a red cherry. She has bright eyes. She is as gentle as water.\n\nShe is slim, with long black hair. Her eyes are big and bright, full of\nsoft and shyness. Her brows are like two leaves of willow. Her lips seem\nvery active. Her skin is white and soft, like cooked fat.\nHer hair is just like golden wave. Her skin is so smooth that you will\nsuspect it is made of marble. Her waist is as soft as watergrass and her\nfingers are slim as the root of onion.\nShe has natural, plain beauty as a woman in the countryside. She is as\npure as crystal. She looks like a floating poem.\nIn our imagination, she is very beautiful and have something of\nmelancholy. In Chinese history, there are four beauties, maybe, she\nlooks like one of them—Wang Zhaojun. For us, we can’t find some\ndescription about their beauty, because their beauty is beyond\ndescription. We can only say: they are very beautiful.\nTHERE WAS AN INTENSITY and a freshness to their readings that I’d\nnever seen before from any other students of literature, and partly it was a\nmatter of studying foreign material. We were exchanging clichés without\nknowing it: I had no idea that classical Chinese poetry routinely makes\nscallions of women’s fingers, and they had no idea that Sonnet Eighteen’s\npoetic immortality had been reviewed so many times that it nearly died, a\npoem with a number tagged to its toe. Our exchange suddenly made\neverything new: there were no dull poems, no overworked plays, no\n\ncharacters who had already been discussed to the point of clinicism. Nobody\ngroaned when I assigned Beowulf—as far as they were concerned, it was just\na good monster story.\nThis was the core of what we studied in that cramped classroom, and on\nthe good days we never left. But there was always a great deal that\nsurrounded us: the campus and its rules, the country and its politics. These\nforces were always present, hovering somewhere outside the classroom, and\nit reached the point where I could almost feel the moments when they pressed\nagainst us, when some trigger was touched and suddenly the Party interfered.\nOccasionally students wrote about how Shakespeare represented the\nProletariat as he criticized English Capitalism (because of this theory, many\nChinese are familiar with The Merchant of Venice), and several pointed out\nthat Hamlet is a great character because he cares deeply about the peasantry.\nOther students told me that the peasants in A Midsummer Night’s Dream are\nthe most powerful figures in the play, because all power comes from the\nProletariat, which is how Revolution starts.\nI had mixed reactions to such comments. It was good to see my students\ninteracting with the text, but I was less enthusiastic about Shakespeare being\nrecruited for Communist Party propaganda. I found myself resisting these\ninterpretations, albeit carefully—in light of my students’ backgrounds, I\ncouldn’t bluntly say that the peasants in A Midsummer Night’s Dream are\npowerless buffoons who provide comic relief. But one way or another I\nalways tried to answer the readings that I felt were misguided. I argued that\nHamlet is a great character not because he cares deeply about the peasantry,\nbut rather because he cares deeply and eloquently about himself; and I\npointed out that Shakespeare was a Petty Bourgeois Capitalist who made his\nfortune by acquiring stock in a theater company.\nFor the first time I came to understand why literature so often slides away\ntoward politics. I had struggled with this before; at Princeton I had majored in\nEnglish, and after graduation I had spent two years studying English\nlanguage and literature at Oxford. My original plan had been to become a\nprofessor of literature, but over time I became less enamored of what I saw in\nEnglish departments, especially in America. Part of it was simply aesthetics\n—I found that I couldn’t read literary criticism, because its academic stiffness\nwas so far removed from the grace of good writing. And I could make very\nlittle sense of most criticism, which seemed a hopeless mess of awkward\n\nwords: Deconstructionism, Post-Modernism, New Historicism. None of it\ncould be explained simply and clearly—just as my Fuling students stumbled\nwhen asked to define Historical Materialism or Socialism with Chinese\nCharacteristics.\nBut mostly I was disturbed by the politicization of literature in the West:\nthe way that literature was read as social commentary rather than art, and the\nway that books were forced to serve political theories of one stripe or\nanother. Very rarely did a critic seem to react to a text; rather the text was\ntwisted so that it reacted neatly to whatever ideas the critic held sacred. There\nwere Marxist critics, Feminist critics, and Post-Colonial critics; and almost\ninvariably they wielded their theories like molds, forcing books inside and\nsqueezing out a neatly-shaped product. Marxists turned out Marxism;\nFeminists turned out Feminism; Post-Colonialists turned out Post-\nColonialism. It was like reading the same senseless book over and over again.\nAnd I resented the way that English departments constantly tinkered with\nthe canon, hoping to create a book list as multicultural as the fake\nphotographs they put on the covers of their undergraduate brochures. It had\nalways seemed to me that with regard to literature there was some value in\nestablishing and respecting a cultural foundation, and now in China I saw\nwhat happened when these roots were completely ripped up. For years the\nChinese had mined literature for its social value, especially during the\nCultural Revolution, when all operas were banned except for a handful of\npolitical works like The Red Detachment of Women. Even today there was\nmuch that had been lost. All of my students knew Marx; none of them knew\nConfucius.\nBut at the same time I came to see the reason for such politicization in a\nmore human light. I realized that part of the power of great literature is its\nuniversality: the daughter of Sichuanese peasants can read Beowulf and make\nconnections to her own life, and a classroom of Chinese students can listen to\na Shakespeare sonnet and see the flawless features of a Tang Dynasty beauty.\nBut along with this power there is a fragility, because it is always tempting to\nmisappropriate the force of a great writer. It’s natural to want Shakespeare on\nyour side—and if he doesn’t fit perfectly, you can twist his words to serve\nyour purpose. Or, if he absolutely refuses to come to heel, you can expel him\nfrom the canon.\nAll of this was commonly done in China, and yet I was surprised to find\n\nthat in some ways my students did a better job of avoiding politics than\nstudents at Princeton and Oxford. As the semester went on, the political\nforces outside the classroom seemed to drift farther and farther away,\nprobably because the material was foreign. The literature was so fresh and\ndifferent that the students usually forgot their standard political guidelines,\nand we also skirted the hassles of English departments in America. None of\nmy students seemed to care that in the fall semester we read strictly dead\nwhite males, just as they didn’t care that a live white male taught the class.\nAs far as they were concerned, all of us were simply waiguoren.\nInstead of worrying about politics, their energy was focused on\nunderstanding the material. They listened to the way the poetry sounded, and\nthey weighed the characters in the stories. They took this seriously—to them,\nliterature wasn’t simply a game, and its figures were like real people who\nshould be judged accordingly. They studied a summary of Hamlet, and after\nreading it a student named Lily responded in her journal:\nMr. Hessler, do you like Hamlet? I don’t admire him and I dislike\nhim. I think he is too sensitive and conservative and selfish. He should\ntell the truth to his dear, Ophelia, and ask her to face and solve the\nproblem together. After all, two lovers should share wealth and woe.\nWhat’s more, I dislike his hesitation. As a man he should do what he\nwants to do resolutely.\nYou couldn’t have said something like that at Oxford. You couldn’t\nsimply say: I don’t like Hamlet because I think he’s a lousy person.\nEverything had to be more clever than that; you had to recognize Hamlet as a\ncharacter in a text, and then you had to dismantle it accordingly, layer by\nlayer, not just the play itself but everything that had ever been written about\nit. You had to consider what all the other critics had said, and the\naccumulated weight of their knowledge and nonsense sat heavily on the play.\nYou had to think about how the play tied in with current events and trends.\nThis process had some value, of course, but for many readers it seemed to\nhave reached the point where there wasn’t even a split-second break before\nthe sophistication started. As a student, that was all I had wanted—a brief\n\nmoment when a simple and true thought flashed across the mind: I don’t like\nthis character. This is a good story. The woman in this poem is beautiful and I\nbet her fingers are slim like scallions.\nThis was what I was looking for as a student—some sign that literature\nwas still enjoyable, that people read for pleasure and that this was important\nin and of itself, apart from the politics; but often it was hard to tell if this was\nhappening. In Fuling, however, there was no question that the students\nenjoyed what they read, and I realized that for the rest of my life I would try\nto think of literature as they saw it. Sometimes, when they were working on\nan assignment and I was looking out at the Wu River, I’d smile and think to\nmyself: We’re all refugees here. They’ve escaped from their classes on\nBuilding Chinese Socialism, and I’ve escaped from Deconstructionism. We\nwere happy, reading poetry while out on the rivers all of Fuling went about\nits business.\nWE STUDIED HAMLET IN OCTOBER, when the weather was still warm\nbut the autumn rains were beginning to settle in the river valley. I divided my\nclasses into eleven groups and they spent a day preparing their scenes, and\nthen they performed the play in the classroom. They pushed the teacher’s\npodium to the side of the room and swept the floor, which was the stage. All\nof the students crowded their stools and desks into the back and from there\nthey watched.\nActing transformed them entirely—in class they could be painfully shy,\nbut drama changed all of that. Every gesture was overblown, every emotion\noverdone; they were incorrigible overactors, and after growing accustomed to\ntheir shyness it was strange to watch them shout and cry on the bare stage of\nthe classroom. Sometimes I thought that perhaps it had something to do with\nthe influence of traditional Chinese opera, in which the action is exaggerated\nand stylized, but more likely it was simply a release in a society where\nemotions were rarely open. Regardless, it was a strange experience to watch\nthem perform; they were half-recognizable, like the play itself, and both the\nstudents and Hamlet became something new in my eyes.\nRoger played the dead king’s ghost, a writhing, howling spirit in a\nbrightly painted cone-shaped Chinese emperor’s crown that he had made of\n\npapier mâché. In any performance of Hamlet it is the ghost that sets the tone\nfor the play, and so it was with Roger in his imperial crown—a touch of\nChina in the class’s Denmark.\nIn the second scene, Hamlet went before Gertrude and Claudius, who\nwere played by Jane and Sally. Romance was always a knotty issue for my\nstudents; even the most casual public contact between sexes was taboo, and\nto play a wife or a girlfriend was too embarrassing for most of the female\nstudents. Often they simplified it the way Jane and Sally did, by making the\ncouple the same sex, because in Fuling it was common for friends to be\nopenly affectionate with each other. And so Sally stroked Jane’s hair, and\nJane fondled the other girl’s arm, and then, realizing that Hamlet was glaring\nat them, Sally said imperiously,\nHow is it that the clouds still hang on you?\nAnd Hamlet—played by Barber, a nervous misnamed boy in thick glasses\nand a cheap tan suit—replied,\nNot so, my lord. I am too much in the sun.\nJane ran her hand along Sally’s thigh. Both of them were pretty girls,\ntheir long hair brushed smooth like black silk. Barber scowled. Languidly\nJane pressed close against Sally, and then she purred,\nGood Hamlet, cast thy nighted color off,\nAnd let thine eye look like a friend on Denmark.\nDon’t continue to be sad for your father,\nYou know that every man must die.\nThey wrote most of the dialogue themselves—the language of the play\nwas too difficult and they used only the most famous lines, writing the rest in\ncolloquial speech. Hamlet’s Act III soliloquy was performed by Soddy, the\n\nclass monitor, who stood alone in front of the class and said,\nTo be, or not to be: that is the question:\nWhether it’s better to do nothing and suffer,\nOr whether I should struggle against Claudius\nAnd end these troubles. To die, to sleep—\nNo more—and by sleeping to end all of\nThese terrible problems! To die, to sleep—\nTo sleep—perchance to dream: ay, there’s the rub….\nHe was a big kid with a lazy eye from the countryside of northern\nSichuan, and the other students called him Lao Da—Big Brother, a nickname\nfrom Hong Kong gangster films, a term of respect that reflected Soddy’s\nauthority. But despite his high position in the class hierarchy, he was a\nrelatively poor student. His writing was fine, but his spoken English was bad\nand he had no confidence in class. Rarely did he speak out or answer\nquestions.\nI had never understood why the students respected Soddy so much until\nthe day he stood in front of us and played Hamlet. His English was still poor\n—he stumbled over the soliloquy, and some of it was unintelligible. But that\ndidn’t matter, because now his talent was suddenly palpable; it was as if he\nhad reached out and caught hold of his gift in the palm of his hand, turning it\nover once or twice, holding it as surely as he held our attention. He was slow,\ndeliberate. He paced the room, and in his movements there were traces of\nSichuan opera—a cloak folded just so over the crook of his arm; a wooden\nstool laid on its side and used as the focus of his wanderings, until he made a\npalace of that simple prop. But mostly his voice was perfect—he controlled\nthe pace and tone of his speech, the way Hamlet’s emotions rise and ebb like\na hot uncertain sea. And Soddy knew how to use both noise and silence, to\nshout in frustration and then let the words resound in the classroom that he\ncleaned every week. He paced restlessly; he crouched on the stool; he buried\nhis head in his hands; he roared and shouted; he kicked at the chair; and\nsuddenly he was silent—and then, after the silence was complete, he said,\nquietly,\n\nThus conscience does make cowards of us all,\nAnd thus we want to do something\nBut our thoughts prevent us\nAnd lose the name of action—\nHe was Hamlet and he was Lao Da; there was no longer any question in\nmy mind. The students watched with rapt attention and at the end they\napplauded madly. For the rest of the year, whenever I looked at Soddy, at his\nsquare jaw and his cockeyed gaze and his dark peasant’s complexion, I saw\nthe Prince of Denmark. That was exactly what Hamlet would have looked\nlike in the countryside of Sichuan province.\nIN THE OTHER CLASS’S PERFORMANCE, Rosencrantz and\nGuildenstern marched before the king, kowtowed until their foreheads nearly\ngrazed the floor, and stood there holding hands while they listened to\nClaudius’s instructions. In Sichuan it was common for male friends to hold\nhands like that—and certainly you would want to hold somebody’s hand if\nyou were being sent off unknowingly to your death.\nThey loved the characters of Rosencrantz and Guildenstern. Some of\nthem were annoyed by Hamlet, and they found Ophelia pathetic, but\neverybody loved Rosencrantz and Guildenstern. They loved their hapless\nprying and they loved their demise, the way the servants are tricked into\ncarrying their own death warrants to the King of England. That was a good\ntouch by Shakespeare—another bit of China in the Bard’s Denmark. It was a\nlittle like Miao Ze in the Chinese classic The Romance of the Three\nKingdoms, who betrays his brother-in-law Ma Teng in order to win the graces\nof the powerful Cao Cao. But Cao Cao, after killing Ma Teng, turns to the\nexpectant Miao Ze and says, “A man so faithless does not deserve to live,”\nand promptly executes him and his entire family in the public square. Or\nmaybe it was like Mao’s general Lin Biao, who had tried to turn the Cultural\nRevolution to his purposes but in the end became one of its victims. In any\ncase, my students knew Rosencrantz and Guildenstern—they had seen those\ncharacters many times in many ages. Even today you could sometimes still\n\nfind them in the cadres’ offices.\nThe play ended in a flurry of swordplay and kung-fu kicks, Laertes and\nHamlet and Claudius involved in what could have been the climax of a Hong\nKong martial arts film, until at the end only Hamlet and Horatio crouched in\nfront of the class. They were played by Vic and Lazy, both of them dressed in\ncheap Western-style suits, and before their scene they carefully spread\nnewspaper across the floor so the Prince could die without getting dirty. The\nclass giggled—but then the scene began, and Lazy leaned against the wall\nand held the dying Hamlet, and everybody hushed.\nLazy cradled him close, like a child, and yet the contact was natural\nbecause Chinese men were allowed to touch each other in that way. Hamlet\ngroaned, tried to speak, coughed out his dying words; Horatio stammered\nfarewell and rocked his friend tenderly in his arms. The class was silent,\nwatching. The actors were small men and alone on the floor they looked even\nsmaller, crouched below the peeling paint and the dusty blackboard. Hamlet\ncoughed again and said,\nI cannot live to hear the news from England,\nBut I support Fortinbras. He has my dying voice.\nSo tell him that—the rest is silence.\nAnd so Hamlet died—and for a moment I almost forgot that I was in a\ncheerless Chinese classroom, and that Horatio was in fact a peasant’s son\nwho liked to sleep and called himself Lazy, holding Hamlet tenderly and\nsaying softly, sadly, Lazily,\nGood night, sweet prince,\nAnd flights of angels sing thee to thy rest.\nTHE LATE-AUTUMN MISTS fell over White Flat Mountain and the\nclassrooms grew colder. They weren’t heated—few public buildings in\nFuling were—and finally I took to closing the door when I taught. The\nstudents started wearing coats, scarves, gloves; their fingers swelled with\n\nchilblains and their ears turned red. I could see their breath in the cold\ncrowded room. We read Swift, Wordsworth, Byron. The verses resounded\nwith sweet regularity as we recited them aloud—iambic puffs of steam rising\ntoward the ceiling. Outside, the unmetered wind blew hard from the Yangtze.\nBeneath their desks the students stamped their feet in the cold.\nThey begged me to assign another Shakespeare play, and at last I did,\npartly to keep warm. I summarized Romeo and Juliet and they played it.\nSoddy and his classmates built a balcony out of desks, an unstable tower\nupon which Lucy stood bravely while Soddy courted her from below. Five\nscenes later, Grace gave Juliet’s soliloquy as she prepared to take the Friar’s\nsleeping potion. Her family was against her, and Romeo had been exiled, and\nin the middle of the scene Grace began to cry. She was a beautiful, lively girl,\none of my favorite students because she always spoke her mind without fear\nof embarrassment. Chinese girls weren’t supposed to be like that—but Grace\ndidn’t care. On the day she played Juliet her long black hair was pulled back\nsmooth past her shoulders, and her eyes shone bright with tears, and her\nbreath came out white in the cold classroom.\nA few days earlier, when they had been preparing the play, I had noticed\none boy standing apart from his group. His English name was Silence Hill. “I\nam always silent,” he had explained back in September, when I first asked\nhim about his name. But he wrote beautifully, a thoughtful young man from a\nvillage of 250 people, and he always had a soft smile on his worn face. On\nthe day that I noticed him standing alone, he was smiling and staring fixedly\nat the text of the play. I asked him what he was looking at, and without a\nword he pointed at two of Juliet’s lines:\nMy only love, sprung from my only hate!\nToo early seen unknown, and known too late!\n“Do you understand what that means?” I asked, thinking he had a\nquestion.\n“Yes,” he said. “I think it’s very beautiful.”\nI paused and looked at the lines again.\n“I think you’re right,” I said, and for a moment neither of us said\n\nanything. Together Silence Hill and I stood there looking at the poetry.\n\nRAISE THE FLAG MOUNTAIN\nTHE MOUNTAIN HAS TWO NAMES, Peach Blossom Mountain and\nRaise the Flag Mountain, and it rises green above the college and the junction\nof the rivers. In spring and fall and winter, the peak often fades into the river-\nvalley fog, and in summer, when the days burn bright under a violent sun, the\ngroves of peach trees near the summit seem to shiver in the heat.\nThe blossoms appear in late March or early April, two brief pink-\nflowered weeks that give the mountain its first name. But almost nobody in\nFuling calls it Peach Blossom Mountain, although the origins of the other title\nare even more fleeting—a single instant during the nineteenth-century\nTaiping Rebellion, when China’s history came to Fuling, marched up the\nmountain, and then moved on. This was perhaps the only time when Fuling\nwas close to the center of China’s affairs, and after more than a century the\necho still remains, the mountain’s name a memorial to a strange and violent\nrevolution.\nThe Great Taiping Rebellion was started in the mid-1840s by Hong\nXiuquan, a poor man from Guangxi province who, frustrated by failing the\nChinese civil service examination four times, decided that he was the Son of\nGod and the younger brother of Jesus Christ. After that, things happened very\nquickly. By 1851, Hong Xiuquan was leading twenty thousand armed\nfollowers, and he declared that he was the Heavenly King of a new dynasty.\nHis soldiers let their hair grow long, fought without fear of death, and\nbelieved a sort of bastardized fundamentalist Protestantism that was based\nloosely on foreign missionary tracts. In 1853, they captured the eastern city\nof Nanjing, calling it their New Jerusalem, and in time Hong Xiuquan ruled\nalmost half of China.\nThe Heavenly Kingdom of Great Peace—Taiping Tianguo—was opposed\nto opium, foot binding, prostitution, gambling, and tobacco, and it had some\nsupport from the Chinese peasants, who had no affection for the corrupt Qing\n\nDynasty rulers. But Hong Xiuquan and the other revolutionary leaders lacked\nthe vision and experience to run a country, and power tempted most of them\ninto luxury and infighting. They began to acquire the trappings of the dynasty\nthey hoped to overthrow: robes of yellow silk, hordes of sycophants, endless\nconcubines. But they were still too powerful to be defeated by the Qing, and\nthe Taipings held Nanjing even while engaging in increasingly bloody\ninternecine power struggles.\nHong Xiuquan’s greatest general was Shi Dakai, who was known as the\nWing King, Lord of Five Thousand Years. Of all the original leaders, he was\nthe most capable, and his disillusionment with the Taiping infighting finally\npushed him to leave Nanjing in 1857. Leading 100,000 soldiers, he embarked\non a military campaign that spanned six years and foreshadowed the\nsweeping troop movements of the Communist Long March. His Taiping\narmy zigzagged across eastern and southern China, arriving eventually at the\nYangtze River valley. In time they came to Fuling, where Shi Dakai and his\nsoldiers marched up the long even slope of Peach Blossom Mountain, and\nthere, at the summit, they raised the flag of the Heavenly Kingdom.\nFROM THE SUMMIT of Raise the Flag Mountain, all of Fuling can be\nseen on a clear day. But in the fall, when the seasonal rains and mists sit\nheavy above the rivers, there are days when the view is blocked by clouds,\nand the city across the Wu is nothing but sound: horns and motors and\nconstruction projects echoing up through the heavy white fog. Sometimes the\nmist will stay for days or even weeks. But then something clears the valleys\n—a shift in temperature, a stiff breeze—and suddenly the view opens.\nSouthward the mountain falls away steeply to valleys of terraced\ncropland, and near the Wu River the land is broken by the settlements of the\nEast River district: the college, looking small with the distance; the ceramics\nfactory, its stacks spewing yellow dust into the air; the long concrete pier and\nthe old ferries that traverse the Wu. The river lies slack, like a long thin bolt\nof gray silk unrolled between the hills.\nIn the mist the city looks dirty and old, its buildings flung carelessly\nacross the hills, and it also looks big. Seen from ground level it is impossible\nto gain perspective on Fuling’s size, but from Raise the Flag Mountain the\n\nscale of the city is suddenly apparent. The gray buildings are piled off far into\nthe horizon, past the distant needlelike spire of the Monument to the\nRevolutionary Martyrs. And yet by Chinese standards it is a small city—a\ntown, really—and all around the jumbled buildings the mountains are green\nand impressive.\nBut none of them is truly wild. The view from Raise the Flag Mountain\nextends for perhaps six miles in every direction, and in that range nearly\nevery inch of useful soil is under cultivation. The same is true for the\nmountain itself: the peak is an orchard, a garden, an enormous farm lying on\nits side, the slope broken into steps and terraces that turn the hillside into\nlevel land.\nPeach and orange groves are planted along the summit, where the\nmountain is too steep for terracing. A bit lower, the slope decreases and the\npeasants have carved the land into short shelves for vegetables—cabbage,\npotatoes, soybeans, radishes. Even lower, the terraces broaden enough for\ngrain crops, and now in the fall it is almost time to plant the winter wheat.\nThe peasants will sow the crop in November and December, and between\nevery two or three rows they will leave a space of two feet. In March, two\nmonths before the wheat is harvested, they will plant corn in the spaces\nbetween the rows. No land is wasted, and nothing is rushed or delayed;\neverything has its season, and every season rests on the simple work that the\npeasants do with their hands.\nFarther down the mountain, the rice paddies were harvested weeks ago;\nnow the fields are dry, and yellow stubble pokes up from the dirt. Most of the\npaddies sit in the low valley of the mountain’s southern flank, where the land\nflattens enough to be shaped into broad sweeping terraces that can hold\nwater. Of all the mountain’s crops, rice has the most intricate routines. It is\nsowed in March, planted densely in seedbeds, and then the following month\nthe green shoots are uprooted and moved by hand to flooded paddies. In July\nand August, the crop is harvested and threshed, and the dry paddy can be\nused for vegetables or winter wheat. And so the cycle continues, season after\nseason, year after year, and sometimes a single plot of land will see a full\nyear’s crops: rice to vegetables, vegetables to wheat, wheat to rice once more.\nThe lower mountain is cut by a dusty road near the Wu River. Below the\nroad, the hillside falls away steeply, but even this floodland is used for winter\npotatoes and mustard tuber. The small plots continue all the way to the rocky\n\nbanks of the Wu, where an old rusted boat approaches the junction of the\nrivers. The craft’s low front deck is empty of cargo, and from the cabin\nflutters a red Chinese flag. The boat reaches the Yangtze, spinning to face the\nriver’s flow. Its motor wheezes. For an instant it pauses, fixed by the current\n—below the mountain, in front of the city, caught in the junction of the two\nrivers. Then the propeller catches hold of the fast-moving Yangtze and the\nboat putters upstream.\nSHI DAKAI AND HIS MEN followed the river valley west from Fuling.\nThey marched past Chongqing and Luzhou, and then they left the Yangtze\nand entered the mountains of western Sichuan. By now it had been years\nsince the march began, and in Nanjing the Heavenly Kingdom was in\nshambles, and finally the brave expedition became a retreat.\nThe army followed the banks of the Dadu, a mountain river in western\nSichuan whose water runs green with glacial melt. The river had seen great\nbattles before—critical campaigns were pitched there in the Three Kingdoms\nPeriod, sixteen centuries earlier. And now the Qing government forces were\nin close pursuit, hoping to trap Shi Dakai and his men in the narrow valleys.\nThe year was 1863.\nThey paused for three days on the banks of the river to mark the birth of\nShi Dakai’s son. The rituals were elaborate, because the boy was a prince in\nthe Heavenly Kingdom—the son of the Wing King, the Lightning of the Holy\nSpirit, the Lord of Five Thousand Years. But the Heavenly Kingdom was\nalready fading into history, and Shi Dakai’s five thousand years would be cut\nshort. The delay at the Dadu proved fatal; the Qing army cornered the rebels,\nand Shi Dakai surrendered after making sure that his five wives and children\nhad been put to death as painlessly as possible. He begged his captors to\nexecute him instead of his faithful followers, whose ranks had already shrunk\nfrom the original 100,000 to two thousand men. The Qing commanders\nlistened patiently to Shi Dakai’s request, and then they massacred the Taiping\ntroops and dismembered the Wing King, slowly.\nSeventy-two years later, Mao Zedong led his Communist forces to the\nsame river during the heart of the Long March. The Kuomintang was on the\nverge of destroying the Red Army, and the lessons of history taught Mao not\n\nto delay. His troops moved steadily northward, until at Luding they came to\nan ancient iron bridge across the Dadu that was well defended by\nKuomintang forces. The situation appeared hopeless.\nThirty Red soldiers volunteered. Under machine-gun fire they crawled\nacross the bridge, hand over hand, iron link by iron link, and against all odds\nthey succeeded in capturing the enemy gun nests. The entire Communist\narmy crossed the river victoriously, having survived what turned out to be the\nmost critical battle of the Long March. Later that year, eight thousand of\nMao’s men, all that remained from an initial force of eighty thousand,\nfinished their trek in northern Shaanxi province. They established a base and\nsteadily grew in power, conquering the nation village by village, province by\nprovince; and in every town they spread their doctrine, which was a sort of\nbastardized Marxism based loosely on the Soviet model. Fourteen years later,\nin 1949, Mao Zedong established the People’s Republic of China.\nThe Communists opposed opium, foot binding, prostitution, and\ngambling, and they had a great deal of support from the Chinese peasants,\nwho had no affection for the grasping landlords and the corruption of the\nKuomintang. But Mao lacked the vision and experience necessary to run a\ncountry effectively, and power inspired him to build a cult of state-worship\naround his image. The leading cadres began to acquire the luxurious\ntrappings of the corrupt reign they had over-thrown: great mansions, hordes\nof sycophants, endless concubines.\nBut even in the late 1990s, as stories of corruption are rife and the\ncountry’s economy quickly privatizes, the official view of history holds\nsteady. The Communist vision of the past idealizes peasant revolts like the\nGreat Taiping Rebellion, until even a remote place like Fuling has a stone\nstatue of Shi Dakai in the public park. Some aspects of the movement, in\ncontrast, have been allowed to fade—Chinese history books say little about\nthe Taipings’ strange brand of Christianity, and many students in a place like\nFuling don’t know that Hong Xiuquan believed himself to be the younger\nbrother of Jesus Christ. But students know that he was a peasant\nrevolutionary, and that Mao succeeded where Hong Xiuquan failed. Such\nechoes are seen as evidence of legitimacy rather than signs that Chinese\nhistory, like the land, sometimes follows a pattern of cycles.\nThe Dadu River runs south to Leshan, where it enters the Min River\nunder the sightless gaze of the largest carved Buddha in the world. The Min\n\nflows southwest to Yibin, where it enters the Yangtze, and from there the\nriver runs west and north for three hundred miles until it passes the green\nterraced slopes of Raise the Flag Mountain. Today there is no flag on the\nrounded peak. The two-named mountain looms large above the river, its solid\nbulk recalling the words that the Sichuan poet Du Fu wrote more than a\nthousand years ago:\nThe state is shattered;\nMountains and rivers remain.\n\nCHAPTER THREE\n\nRunning\nIN THE MORNINGS I often ran to the summit of Raise the Flag Mountain.\nAs I ran, I studied the propaganda signs along the route, although at the\nbeginning there wasn’t much about them that was recognizable. There were\nthree signs on the road out to the mountain, and to me they looked like this:\nI finished my runs back in the center of campus, not far from the teaching\nbuilding, where a stone wall served as a backdrop for an inscription of three-\nfoot-high characters:\nThat was how Chinese appeared in my first few months. I arrived in\nFuling able to recognize about forty characters, all of them simple: people,\nmiddle, country, above, below, long, man, woman. There hadn’t been time\nfor more; the Peace Corps had given us an intensive course during our two\nmonths of training in Chengdu, but the emphasis was on learning enough\nspoken Mandarin to function. We had to study written Chinese on our own,\nand until I got to Fuling I simply hadn’t had enough time.\nI came to Sichuan because I wanted to teach, but I also had two other\nmotivations: I thought the experience would make me a better writer, and I\nwanted to learn Chinese. These were very clear goals, but the way to achieve\n\nthem was much less obvious. I hoped the writing would take care of itself—I\nwould keep my eyes open and take notes, and eventually, when I felt I was\nready, I would start to write. But Chinese was a different matter altogether\nand I had never undertaken something like that before.\nThat was one reason I had decided to come to China with the Peace\nCorps, because I knew they would try to teach me the language. Their\nChengdu training course had been excellent; the classes were small and the\nteachers experienced, and it had been easy to make progress. In Fuling,\nthough, language study was my own affair. The Peace Corps would pay for\ntutors, but I had to find them myself, and I had to decide which textbooks I\nwould use and how I would structure my studies. It was a daunting task—\nessentially, I had to figure out how to learn Chinese.\nFor the first few weeks, Dean Fu searched for tutors who could help\nAdam and me. He was as lost as we were—he had never known a foreigner\nwho was trying to learn the language, and I suspected that secretly he felt the\nproject was hopeless. Waiguoren couldn’t learn Chinese—everybody in\nFuling knew that. Our students found it hilarious that we even tried. They\nwould ask me to speak a little Chinese, or write a character or two, and then\nthey would laugh at my efforts. At first this didn’t bother me, but quickly it\nbecame annoying. They thought I was dabbling in the language when in fact I\nwas serious: I knew that studying Chinese was one of the most important\nthings I could do in Fuling. So much depended on knowing the language—\nmy friendships, my ability to function in the city, my understanding of the\nplace.\nI also wanted to learn Chinese out of stubbornness, because as a\nwaiguoren you weren’t expected to do that. Such low expectations had a long\ntradition; even as late as the early 1800s it had been illegal for a Chinese to\nteach the language to foreigners, and a number of Chinese were imprisoned\nand even executed for tutoring young Englishmen. This bit of history\nfascinated me: how many languages had been sacred and forbidden to\noutsiders? Certainly, those laws had been changed more than a century ago,\nbut China was still ambivalent about opening to the outside world and\nlanguage was still at the heart of this issue. In good conscience I could not\nlive there for two years and not learn to speak Chinese. To me, this was as\nimportant as fulfilling my obligations as a teacher.\nBut this need wasn’t nearly as obvious to everybody else. Dean Fu took a\n\nlong time finding tutors, and perhaps he was hoping that we’d forget about it.\nWe didn’t need Chinese to teach, after all, and we already knew enough to\nbuy groceries and eat at local restaurants. That should be adequate, people\nfigured. In some respects, we were seen as English-teaching machines, or\nperhaps farm animals—expensive and skittish draft horses that taught\nliterature and culture. We were given cadres’ apartments, and we had our\nown Changhong-brand color televisions with remote. Our bedrooms were air-\nconditioned. Each of us had a good kitchen and two beautiful balconies. Our\nstudents were obedient and respectful. It didn’t matter that, even as we were\ngiven all of these things, the leaders also gave quiet instructions to our\ncolleagues and students that they should avoid associating with us outside of\nclass. Waiguoren were risky, especially with regard to politics, and in any\ncase we didn’t need close friends in the college. We could teach during the\nday and return to our comfortable cages at night, and, if we needed\nfriendship, we always had each other. They even gave us telephones so we\ncould call Peace Corps volunteers who lived in other parts of Sichuan.\nSome of the more insightful students sensed that this did not make a full\nlife. In his journal, Soddy wrote me a short note, politely addressed in the\nthird person:\nPete and Adam come to our college to teach our English without pay.\nWe are thankful for this behavior. But we are worried about Pete and\nAdam’s lives. For example: Pete and Adam know little Chinese, so they\ncan’t watch Chinese TV programmes. I think your lives are difficult. I\nwant to know how you spend your spare time.\nIt was a good question. My teaching and preparation time rarely took\nmuch more than thirty hours a week. I ran in the mornings, and sometimes I\nwent for walks in the hills. Adam and I played basketball and threw the\nFrisbee. I wrote on my computer. I planned other diversions for the future—\nsubjects I wanted to cover in class, possible travel destinations. Mostly,\nthough, I knew that there was plenty of exploring to be done in the city, but at\nthe beginning this was the hardest place of all to open up.\nDowntown Fuling looked good from my balcony. Often I’d gaze across\n\nthe Wu River at the maze of streets and stairways, listening to the distant hum\nof daily life, and I’d think about the mysteries that were hidden in the river\ntown. I wanted to investigate all of it—I wanted to go down to the docks and\nwatch the boats; I wanted to talk with the stick-stick soldiers; I wanted to\nexplore the network of tangled staircases that ran through the old part of\ntown. I longed to figure out how the city worked and what the people\nthought, especially since no foreigner had done this before. It wasn’t like\nliving in Beijing or Shanghai, where there were plenty of waiguoren who had\ndiscovered what the city had to offer. As far as foreigners were concerned,\nFuling was our city—or it would be once we figured it out.\nBut once I got there it didn’t look so good. Partly this was because of the\ndirt and noise; the main city of Fuling was an unbelievably loud and polluted\nplace. There wasn’t as much heavy industry as in other parts of China, but\nthere were a few good-sized factories that spewed smoke and dust into the\nair. The power plant on the banks of the Wu River burned coal, as did all of\nthe countless small restaurants that lined the city’s streets, and automobile\nemissions were poorly regulated. In winter the air was particularly dirty, but\neven in summer it was bad. If I went to town and blew my nose, the tissue\nwas streaked with black grease. This made me think about how the air was\naffecting my lungs, and for a while I wondered what could be done about\nthis. Finally I decided to stop looking at tissues after I blew my nose.\nNoise was even more impressive. Most of it came from car horns, and it\nis difficult to explain how constant this sound was. I can start by saying:\nDrivers in Fuling honked a lot. There weren’t a great number of cars, but\nthere were enough, and they were always passing each other in a mad rush to\nget to wherever they were going. Most of them were cabs, and virtually every\ncabby in Fuling had rewired his horn so it was triggered by a contact point at\nthe tip of the gearshift. They did this for convenience; because of the hills,\ndrivers shifted gears frequently, and with their hand on the stick it was\npossible to touch the contact point ever so slightly and the horn would sound.\nThey honked at other cars, and they honked at pedestrians. They honked\nwhenever they passed somebody, or whenever they were being passed\nthemselves. They honked when nobody was passing but somebody might be\nconsidering it, or when the road was empty and there was nobody to pass but\nthe thought of passing or being passed had just passed through the driver’s\nmind. Just like that, an unthinking reflex: the driver honked. They did it so\n\noften that they didn’t even feel the contact point beneath their fingers, and the\nother drivers and pedestrians were so familiar with the sound that they\nessentially didn’t hear it. Nobody reacted to horns anymore; they served no\npurpose. A honk in Fuling was like the tree falling in the forest—for all\nintents and purposes it was silent.\nBut at the beginning Adam and I heard it. For the first few weeks we\noften complained about the honking and the noise, the same way we\ncomplained about blowing our noses and seeing the tissue turn black. But the\nsimple truth was that you could do nothing about either the noise or the\npollution, which meant that they could either become very important and\nvery annoying, or they could become not important at all. For sanity’s sake\nwe took the second option, like the locals, and soon we learned to talk about\nother things.\nI realized this in early November, when a college friend of mine named\nScott Kramer came to visit. For five years he had lived in Manhattan, and yet\nthe noise in Fuling absolutely stunned him; he heard every horn, every shout,\nevery blurted announcement from every loudspeaker. When he left, we took a\ncab from the college to the docks, and Kramer, who worked on Wall Street\nand had a mathematical turn of mind, counted the honks as our driver sped\nthrough the city. It was a fifteen-minute ride and the driver touched his\ncontact point 566 times. It came to thirty-seven honks per minute.\nIf Kramer hadn’t been counting, I wouldn’t have noticed, and I realized\nthat I had stopped hearing the horns long ago, just like everybody else in\ntown. In fact, Kramer was the only person in the whole city who heard them,\nwhich explained why he was so overwhelmed. The entire city had been\nhonking at him for a week.\nFor me it wasn’t the same, and after a month or so the discomforts of\nFuling weren’t important enough to deter me from going into town. Despite\nthe noise and the pollution, it was still a fascinating place, and I still wanted\nto explore its corners and learn its secrets. But the language was an enormous\nproblem, and in the beginning it made the city frustrating and even\nfrightening.\nMandarin Chinese has a reputation as a difficult language—some experts\nsay it takes four times as long to learn as Spanish or French—and its\ncharacters and tones are particularly challenging to a Westerner, because they\nare completely different from the way our languages are structured. In\n\nSichuan, things are further complicated by the provincial dialect, which is\ndistinct enough that a Chinese outsider has trouble understanding the locals in\na place like Fuling. The variations between Mandarin and Sichuanese are\nsignificant: in addition to some differences in vocabulary, Sichuanese slurs\nthe Mandarin reflexive sounds—sh becomes s, zh becomes z—and certain\nconsonants are reversed, so that the average person in Sichuan confuses n and\nl, and h and f. A word like “Hunan” becomes “Fulan.” The Sichuanese tonal\nrange is also shorter, and most significant, two of the four Mandarin tones are\nreversed in Sichuan. If Mandarin is your starting point, it seems that the\nentire language has been flattened and turned upside down.\nIn addition, Sichuan is an enormous province where lack of development,\nparticularly with regard to road and rail links, has resulted in vast regional\ndifferences. The Chengdu dialect is distinct from that of Chongqing, which is\nalso different from that of Leshan, and so on. The town of Fengdu is less than\nthirty miles downstream from Fuling, and yet occasionally the residents of\nthese places have difficulty understanding each other. At a Fuling restaurant,\nif you want the dish known as hundun in Mandarin—translated in English as\n“wonton”—you have to ask for chaoshou, but if you go another thirty miles\nto Fengdu you’ll have to call it baomian. Or, more accurately, baomin,\nbecause the folks in Fengdu slur the ian sounds.\nThe result is a hell of a mess that I hadn’t expected. I came to China\nhoping to learn Chinese, but quickly I realized there was no such thing.\n“Chinese” was whatever it took to communicate with the person you\nhappened to be talking with, and this changed dramatically depending on\nbackground and education level. Educated people usually could speak\nMandarin, especially if they were from the younger generation—the walls of\nour classrooms had enormous signs that commanded: “Use Mandarin!” But\nthe vast majority of Fuling’s population was uneducated and functioned only\nin the dialect. It made going to town a frustrating experience, because even\nthe simplest conversations were difficult, and it also made my goal of\nlearning Chinese seem impossible: I couldn’t imagine learning both\nMandarin and Sichuanese in two years. In fact, all I needed to do was\nimprove my Mandarin, which would naturally enable me to handle the\ndialect, but in the early months I didn’t know that. It seemed that I was in\nhopelessly over my head, and every trip into town was a reminder of that\nfailure.\n\nAnd Fuling was a frightening place because the people had seen so few\noutsiders. If I ate at a restaurant or bought something from a store, a crowd\nwould quickly gather, often as many as thirty people spilling out into the\nstreet. Most of the attention was innocent curiosity, but it made the\nembarrassment of my bad Chinese all the worse—I’d try to communicate\nwith the owner, and people would laugh and talk among themselves, and in\nmy nervousness I would speak even worse Mandarin. When I walked down\nthe street, people constantly turned and shouted at me. Often they screamed\nwaiguoren or laowai, both of which simply meant “foreigner.” Again, these\nphrases often weren’t intentionally insulting, but intentions mattered less and\nless with every day that these words were screamed at me. Another favorite\nwas “hello,” a meaningless, mocking version of the word that was strung out\ninto a long “hah-loooo!” This word was so closely associated with foreigners\nthat sometimes the people used it instead of waiguoren—they’d say, “Look,\nhere come two hellos!” And often in Fuling they shouted other less innocent\nterms—yangguizi, or “foreign devil” da bizi, “big nose”—although it wasn’t\nuntil later that I understood what these phrases meant.\nThe stresses piled up every time I went into town: the confusion and\nembarrassment of the language, the shouts and stares, the mocking calls. It\nwas even worse for Adam, who was tall and blond; at least I had the\nadvantage of being dark-haired and only slightly bigger than the locals. For a\nwhile we adopted the strategy of going into town together, thinking that\nbetween the two of us we could more easily handle the pressure. This was a\nmistake, though, because adding another waiguoren only increased the\nattention, and after a month of that we started making our trips solo. Finally,\nas the fall semester wore on, we did everything possible to avoid going to\ntown. When I did go, I wore headphones. That was the only way I could\nhandle it; I listened to the loudest and most offensive rap music I had—Dr.\nDre, Snoop Doggy Dogg, the Beastie Boys—and it was just enough to drown\nout the shouts as I walked down the street. It made for surreal trips\ndowntown, listening to Snoop rap obscenities while I dodged the crowds, but\nit kept me sane.\nAnd so Soddy’s question remained: How do you spend your spare time?\nWhen I finished teaching I would sit at my desk, which looked out across the\nWu River to the city, and I would write:\n\nWhile I wrote, I pronounced the word over and over, as carefully as I\ndrew it:\n“Xue xue xue xue xue xue xue xue xue xue xue xue xue xue xue xue xue\nxue xue xue.”\nI would write the same character about a hundred times total, and then I\nwould think of ways in which it was used: xuexi, xuesheng, xuexiao. I would\nwrite it on a flash card and put it on a stack that grew steadily on my desk—\nbetween five and ten a day, usually. I listened to language tapes and reviewed\nthe text that we had used during Peace Corps training. I flipped through the\nflash cards. By early October, when Dean Fu finally found two Chinese\ntutors, I had learned 150 characters. The signs on the way to Raise the Flag\nMountain were still unintelligible, but the one in the center of campus had\nchanged slightly:\nTeaching People, People,\nPeople, Environment People\nOUR TUTORS were Kong Ming and Liao Mei, and we came to know them\nas Teacher Kong and Teacher Liao. They taught in the Chinese department,\nand neither of them spoke any English. They had never known a waiguoren\nbefore. Dean Fu had been unable to find tutors who spoke English, and at last\nwe told him it wasn’t important. We wanted to get started and we knew that\nChinese department teachers had good Mandarin.\nTeacher Kong was a short man who wore glasses and smelled of\nMagnificent Sound cigarettes. He was thirty-two years old, and he taught\nancient Chinese literature. By Chinese standards he was slightly fat, which\nmeant that by American standards he was slightly thin. He smiled easily. He\nwas from the countryside of Fengdu, which was famous for its ghosts—\nlegend said that spirits went to Fengdu after death.\n\nTeacher Liao was a very thin woman with long black hair and a reserved\nmanner. She was twenty-seven years old, and she taught modern Chinese.\nShe smiled less than Teacher Kong. Our students, who also had some courses\nin the Chinese department, considered Teacher Liao to be one of their better\ninstructors. She was from the central Sichuan city of Zigong, which was\nfamous for its salt. Every city and small town in Sichuan claimed to be\nfamous for something. Fuling was famous for the hot pickled mustard tuber\nthat was cured along the banks of the rivers.\nThat was essentially everything we knew about Teachers Kong and Liao\nfor months. We also knew about their Mandarin, which was very clear except\nfor a slight Sichuanese tendency to confuse the n and l sounds. Other than\nthat we knew nothing. To us they were like Chinese-teaching machines, or\nperhaps farm animals—a sort of inexpensive and bored draft horse that\ncorrected bad tones. And to them we were very stupid waiguoren from a\ncountry whose crude tongue had no tones at all.\nMy first tutorial with Teacher Liao was scheduled for two hours, but I\nlasted less than sixty minutes. I went home with my head reeling—had a\nhuman being ever compressed more wrongness into a single hour?\nEverything was wrong—tones, grammar, vocabulary, initial sounds. She\nwould ask me a question and I would try to process the language to respond,\nbut before I could speak she was answering it herself. She spoke clearly, of\ncourse, and it was also true that during that hour not a word of English had\nbeen spoken. That was what I wanted, after all—a Chinese tutor. But I\ncouldn’t imagine doing that for seven hours a week and maintaining my\nsanity, and I looked at the pathetic stack of flash cards on my desk and\nthought: This is hopeless.\nFor a solid month it looked that way. I was too self-absorbed to even\nimagine what it was like from the other side, but later I realized that it was\neven worse for my teachers. They weren’t under threat of execution for\nteaching the sacred tones to a waiguoren—that law, at least, had been\nchanged since Qing Dynasty days. But theirs wasn’t an enviable job. First of\nall, we underpaid them. This wasn’t intentional; Adam and I had been given\nwrong information about the standard rate for tutors. Teachers Kong and\nLiao, of course, were far too polite to set us straight, which meant that for the\nentire first year they worked for two-thirds of what they deserved. Even\nworse, though, they were underpaid for seven weekly hours of boredom and\n\nfrustration. The lessons in the book were simple—taking a train, going to a\nrestaurant—and yet I botched everything, and they had no idea how to steer\nme in the right direction. How do you teach somebody to speak Chinese?\nHow do you take your knowledge of ancient poetry and use it to help a\nwaiguoren master something as basic as the third tone?\nWe were all lost, and that failure seemed to be the extent of our\nrelationship. Other Peace Corps volunteers had tutors who spoke English, so\nat least they could chat together after class. They heard about their tutors’\nfamilies; they ate dinner together; they became friends. My tutors didn’t seem\nlike real people—it was months before I learned that Teacher Liao was\nmarried and that Teacher Kong had a son. Here the language problem was\ncompounded by the fact that at the beginning they were somewhat cagey and\ndistant; they had never known a waiguoren before, and they weren’t at all\ncertain how to approach us.\nChinese teaching styles are also significantly different from western\nmethods, which made my tutorials even more frustrating. In China, a teacher\nis absolutely respected without question, and the teacher-student relationship\ntends to be formal. The teacher teaches and is right, and the student studies\nand is wrong. But this isn’t our tradition in America, as my own students\nnoticed. I encouraged informality in our classes, and if a student was wrong I\npointed out what she had done right and praised her for making a good effort.\nTo them, this praise was meaningless. What was the point of that? If a\nstudent was wrong, she needed to be corrected without any quibbling or\nsoftening—that was the Chinese way.\nI couldn’t teach like that, and it was even harder to play the role of\nstudent. Actually, this became worse after my Chinese classes started to feel\nproductive, which happened more quickly than I expected. The characters in\nmy book’s lessons had always been elusive, odd-shaped scratches of black\nthat drifted in and out of my head, calling up arbitrary allusions that were\nmisleading. They were pictures rather than words: I would look at and\nthink of K-mart, and the twenty-seventh radical— reminded me of the\nletter B, or perhaps an ax hanging on a wall. looked like a man doing\njumping jacks. was a marching spider carrying a flag across the page. I\nstared so long at those odd figures that I dreamed about them—they swarmed\n\nin my head and I awoke vaguely disturbed and missing home.\nBut at a certain point it was as if some of the scratchings stood up straight\nand looked me in the eye, and the fanciful associations started slipping away.\nSuddenly they became words; they had meaning. Of course, it didn’t happen\nall at once, and it was work that did it—I was studying madly in an effort to\nmake the classes less miserable. But I was so busy that I hardly had time to\nrealize that progress was being made.\nOne day after more than a month of classes, I read aloud a paragraph\nfrom my book, recognizing all of the characters smoothly except for one. I sat\nback and started to register the achievement: I was actually reading Chinese.\nThe language was starting to make sense. But before this sense of satisfaction\nwas half formed, Teacher Liao said, “Budui!”\nIt meant, literally, “Not correct.” You could also translate it as no, wrong,\nnope, uh-uh. Flatly and clearly incorrect. There were many Chinese words\nthat I didn’t know, but I knew that one well.\nA voice in my head whined: All of the rest of them were right; isn’t that\nworth something? But for Teacher Liao it didn’t work like that. If one\ncharacter was wrong it was simply budui.\n“What’s this word?” I asked, pointing at the character I had missed.\n“Zhe—the zhe in zhejiang.”\n“Third tone?”\n“Fourth tone.”\nI breathed deeply and read the section again, and this time I did it\nperfectly. That was a victory—I turned to Teacher Liao and my eyes said (or\nat least I imagined them saying): How do you like me now? But Teacher\nLiao’s eyes were glazed with boredom and she said, “Read the next one.”\nThey were, after all, simple paragraphs. Any schoolchild could handle them.\nIt was the Chinese way. Success was expected and failure criticized and\npromptly corrected. You were right or you were budui; there was no middle\nground. As I became bolder with the language I started experimenting with\nnew words and new structures, and this was good but it was also a risk. I\nwould finish a series of sentences using vocabulary that I knew Teacher Liao\ndidn’t expect me to know, and I would swear that I could see her flinch with\nunwilling admiration. And yet she would say, “Budui!” and correct the part\nthat had been wrong.\nI grew to hate budui: its sound mocked me. There was a harshness to it;\n\nthe bu was a rising tone and the dui dropped abruptly, building like my\nconfidence and then collapsing all at once. And it bothered me all the more\nbecause I knew that Teacher Liao was only telling the truth: virtually\neverything I did with the language was budui. I was an adult, and as an adult\nI should be able to accept criticism where it was needed. But that wasn’t the\nAmerican way; I was accustomed to having my ego soothed; I wanted to be\npraised for my effort. I didn’t mind criticism as long as it was candy-coated. I\nwas caught in the same trap that I had heard about from some of my Chinese-\nAmerican friends, who as children went to school and became accustomed to\nthe American system of gentle correction, only to return home and hear their\nChinese-minded parents say, simply, budui. That single B on the report card\nmatters much more than the string of A’s that surrounds it. Keep working;\nyou haven’t achieved anything yet.\nAnd so I studied. I was frustrated but I was also stubborn; I was\ndetermined to show Teacher Liao that I was dui. Virtually all of my spare\ntime went to studying Chinese, and the stack of flash cards on my desk grew\nrapidly. By the first week in November I knew three hundred characters. I\nhad no clear idea what I was shooting for—I had a vague goal of reading a\nnewspaper, which would require between two and three thousand. But mostly\nI knew that I needed more knowledge than I had, and I needed it quickly.\nIn the mornings I ran to the summit of Raise the Flag Mountain, charging\nhard up the steps, my lungs burning high above the Yangtze. The effort was\nsatisfying—it was challenging but uncomplicated, and at the finish I could\nlook down on the city and see where I had gone. It was different from the\nwork of learning Chinese, which had no clear endpoint and gave me more\nfrustration than satisfaction.\nThere was a skill to running, and in some ways it was the only skill I had\nin Fuling. Everybody else seemed to have found something that he or she was\ngood at: the owner of the dumpling restaurant made dumplings, the shoeshine\nwomen shined shoes, the stick-stick soldiers carried loads on their leathered\nshoulders. It was less clear what my purpose was—I was a teacher, and that\njob was satisfying and clearly defined, but it disappeared once I left campus.\nMost people in town only saw my failures, the inevitable misunderstandings\nand botched conversations.\nAnd they always watched carefully. The attention was so intense that in\npublic I often became clumsily self-conscious, which was exacerbated by my\n\nsuddenly becoming bigger than average. In America I was considered small\nat five feet nine inches, but now for the first time in my life I stood out in\ncrowds. I bumped my head on bus doorways; I squeezed awkwardly behind\nminiature restaurant tables. I was like Alice in Wonderland, eating the\ncurrant-seed cakes and finding her world turned upside down.\nMostly I longed to find something that I could do well. This was part of\nwhy the simple routines of the city fascinated me; I could watch a stick-stick\nsoldier or a restaurant cook with incredible intensity simply because these\npeople were good at what they did. There was a touch of voyeurism in my\nattention, at least in the sense that I watched the people work with all of the\nvoyeur’s impotent envy. There were many days when I would have liked\nnothing more than to have had a simple skill that I could do over and over\nagain, as long as I did it well.\nRunning was repetitive in this way, and it was also an escape. If I ran on\nthe roads, cars honked at me, people laughed and shouted, and sometimes a\nyoung man would try to impress his friends by chasing after me. But crowds\ncouldn’t gather around, and none of the young men followed for long. I ran\nalone, and in a crowded country that sort of solitude was worth something.\nThere was nobody in the city who could catch me.\nUsually I ran in the hills behind campus, following the small roads and\nfootpaths that wound around Raise the Flag Mountain. I ran past old Daoist\nshrines, and atop the narrow walls of the rice paddies, and I followed the\nstone steps that led to the mountain’s summit. I liked running past the ancient\nstone tombs that overlooked the rivers, and I liked seeing the peasants at\nwork. On my runs I watched them harvest the rice crop, and thresh the\nyellowed stalks, and I saw them plant the winter wheat and tend their\nvegetables. I first learned the agricultural patterns by watching the workers as\nI ran, and I studied the shape of the mountain by feeling it beneath my legs.\nThe peasants found it strange that I ran in the hills, and they always stared\nwhen I charged past, but they never shouted or laughed. As a rule they were\nthe most polite people you could ever hope to meet, and in any case they had\nmore important things to do with their energy than scream at waiguoren. And\nperhaps they had an innate respect for physical effort, even when they didn’t\nsee the point.\nThe air in the countryside was often bad, because the Yangtze winds blew\nthe city’s pollution across the Wu River, and I knew that running did my\n\nhealth more harm than good. But it kept my mind steady, because the fields\nwere quiet and peaceful and the activity felt the same as it always had. That\nold well-known feeling—the catch in my chest, the strain in my legs—\nconnected all the places where I had lived, Missouri and Princeton and\nOxford and Fuling. While I ran through the hills, my thoughts swung fluidly\nbetween these times and places; I remembered running along the old\nMissouri-Kansas-Texas railroad pathway, and I recalled the rapeseed\nblooming gold on Boar’s Hill, and the old shaded bridge of Prettybrook. As\nthe months slipped past I realized that even these Sichuan hills, with their\nstrange tombs and terraces, were starting to feel like home.\nBut still the signs on the way to Raise the Flag Mountain were foreign,\nand even as they slowly became familiar they reminded me how far I still had\nto go:\nBuild Culture, New Give Birth\nPopulation Increase, Society\nEducation Is a Powerful Country’s\nDURING THAT SEMESTER there was a volatility to the written language;\nit constantly shifted in my eyes, and each day the shapes became something\nother than what they had been before. Spoken Chinese was also starting to\nsettle in my ears, and soon I could make simple conversation with the owners\nof the restaurants where I ate. The same slow shift was also happening with\nregard to my tutors, who finally started to change from tone machines into\nreal people.\nAs this happened, I began to sense an edge to Teacher Liao that I couldn’t\nquite figure. It wasn’t simply her tendency to say budui; she seemed slightly\n\nuncomfortable around both Adam and me, and there were moments when I\nalmost thought she disliked us (which, given that we didn’t pay her enough,\nwould have been understandable). Later, I would come to recognize other\nreasons for this discomfort, but during that first semester I only sensed that\nthere were complications in our relationship.\nOnce we had a tutorial the day after I had played in the faculty basketball\ntournament, and she asked what I had thought of the game. In fact, it had\ngone very badly—Adam and I were starting to realize that there was a great\ndeal of resentment over our participation, because the English department\nteam was now suddenly very good. To the other participants, the games were\ntaking on a patriotic significance; it was a matter of China vs. America, an\nissue of saving face for the Motherland, and the games grew steadily rougher\nand rougher. The referees also took sides; they allowed our opponents to foul\nus while constantly whistling us for phantom violations. In the game before\nour tutorial, I had been whistled more than fifteen times for double-dribble—\nby the end of the game I only had to touch the ball and the whistle would\nblow. Adam and I were considering pulling out of the tournament, which we\neventually did. It seemed the best solution for everybody involved.\nI knew that Teacher Liao had been at the game, and I assumed that she\nfelt the same way I did. My students had been embarrassed by the poor\nsportsmanship, and they told me that the referee had a horrible reputation on\ncampus. He was notorious for getting into fights—once he even threatened an\nadministrator with a knife. His wife had recently divorced him; the rumor\nwas that he had beaten her. And yet the college was unable to fire him,\nbecause of the job security that was promised to all state workers under the\ntraditional Communist system.\nI answered Teacher Liao’s question honestly, telling her that I hadn’t\nfound the game much fun.\n“That referee,” I said, “is a huai dan.” It was a common insult: bad egg.\n“Budui!” said Teacher Liao. “It wasn’t his problem—you were wrong.\nAnd you should not criticize the referee.”\nTo me this seemed insult upon injury. I wanted to tell her: There are no\ntones in basketball and you have no jurisdiction over it. But she had more to\nsay.\n“You were dribbling wrong,” she said. “That’s why he kept penalizing\nyou. You were doing this—” And she gestured, showing me that I had carried\n\nthe ball.\n“Budui!” I said. “That’s not what I was doing. I was dribbling the same\nway I always do in America. That referee just doesn’t like waiguoren. And he\ndoesn’t understand basketball.”\n“Budui! Here you can’t dribble the same way that you do in America,\nbecause they have different rules in the NBA. That’s the problem—you’re\naccustomed to playing the American way.”\nShe said it in hopes of ending the argument tactfully, because she saw\nthat I was annoyed. But I had already heard too many explanations about “the\nChinese way,” and I did not want to be lectured about Basketball with\nChinese Characteristics.\n“Basketball is an American sport,” I said. “We made the rules and I\nunderstand them. That referee just doesn’t like waiguoren.” After I spoke, I\nrealized how stupid my words sounded, and I might as well have continued:\nAnd we Americans can study a language for only four months and already\nconvey our arrogance. But I didn’t have the vocabulary for that, and in any\ncase it was clear that both of us wanted to talk about something else. We\nreviewed a lesson about going to the airport and nobody mentioned\nbasketball again.\nClasses were simpler with Teacher Kong, who alternated weeks with\nTeacher Liao. He was slightly less inclined to say budui, partly because he\nhad a lazy streak, but also because the struggles of that semester were slowly\nteaching us to recognize each other as people. Eventually he would become\nmy first real Chinese friend—the first friend who saw me strictly in Chinese.\nAnd even in those early months, before we developed a true friendship, I\ncould see his interest growing. He sometimes asked me about America,\nwithin the limits of my vocabulary, and I sensed there were many questions\nhe would ask once he had the chance. Certainly I had a few of my own that\nwere waiting for the language to catch up with my thoughts.\nWe had classes in my dining room, where the morning light was warm\nafter the sun rose above the shoulder of Raise the Flag Mountain. We drank\ntea while we studied—jasmine flower tea, the tiny dried petals unfolding like\nblooming lilies on the surface of the hot water. Before he drank, Teacher\nKong blew softly over the cup, so the loose leaves and flowers floated to the\nfar side, and this was something else I learned in those classes. If he sipped a\nleaf by mistake, he turned and spat lightly on the floor. I learned that, too—I\n\nliked living in a cadre’s apartment and still being able to spit on the floor.\nOne sunny afternoon in December, I was preparing for class when I heard\nloud music blaring from the plaza below. There wasn’t anything unusual\nabout that—the campus loudspeakers were always vomiting noise. But today\nI looked down from my balcony and saw a crowd assembling in front of the\nauditorium, and I knew that some sort of important event was about to take\nplace.\nMy balcony looked straight down to the plaza and I could see everything\nclearly. A banner had been unfurled and stretched above the steps. I couldn’t\nmake out most of the characters, but a few were recognizable: “Safety,”\n“Environment,” “Peace.” A row of chairs materialized below the banner. The\ncrowd grew larger. Tables were set in front of the chairs. A blue cloth was\nlaid upon the tables; teacups were put on the cloth. Microphones appeared.\nI had seen this sort of arrangement before—it was a nesting area for\ncadres. Soon six of them marched up the steps and took their places at the\ntable. I strained to see who they were, but I couldn’t recognize their faces,\nand all I saw was that some were in uniform. But many people in Fuling wore\nuniforms and that never told you anything.\nThe speeches began, echoing up to my balcony. A crowd gathered at the\nbottom of the auditorium steps—mostly students, but also people from the\nneighborhood outside the gates, old peasants and women with their babies.\nThey listened quietly, and in their silence I could see that it was a serious\nevent. The speeches reverberated in the plaza and I couldn’t understand what\nthey were saying.\nTeacher Kong arrived for class and set his books on the dining-room\ntable. “It’s very loud,” he said, smiling, and I agreed—too loud to concentrate\non Lesson Thirty-one and its mindless description of a train ride to Guilin.\nWe stepped out onto the balcony and watched the crowd. There were\nhundreds of people listening to the speeches now, and I could see groups of\nstudents hurrying down from the teaching building.\n“All of the students have been excused from class,” Teacher Kong said,\nand I asked him what the event was. “They’re going to panjue two people,”\nhe said. “It’s a public panjue.”\nI hadn’t studied the word, and he explained its meaning until I was nearly\ncertain I understood. I went into the dining room to double-check with the\ndictionary—“panjue: bring a verdict; judgment.” They were having a public\n\nsentencing in front of the auditorium.\n“Are they students?” I asked.\n“No. They’re from East River.”\nI asked what they had done, and he explained that there had been a series\nof fights between East River people and students in the physical education\ndepartment. East River was a rough part of town, a seedy riverfront section of\nsmall shops and dusty warehouses. After the Three Gorges Dam was built,\nmuch of East River would disappear underwater, and few people would\nprobably miss it. The dirty streets were depressing, and the residents, most of\nwhom were poor, saw the students as privileged outsiders—spoiled kids who\nlived six or seven to a bare room, cleaned their unheated classrooms, and\nwoke up at six o’clock every morning for mandatory exercises. Sichuanese\ntown-and-gown tension was, like anything else, a matter of relative\nconditions.\nRecently this animosity had turned ugly; some of the East River men had\nused knives and sticks in the fights, and a couple of students had been hurt. I\nheard about it from my own students, who wrote in their journals about a\nweekend night when two physical education boys had been injured and their\nfriends returned to the dormitory for reinforcements. They were collecting\nweapons of their own when the police arrived.\n“None of the injuries was too serious,” said Teacher Kong. “But they\nwant to show the students that the college is safe, so today they’re having a\npublic panjue.”\nThe cadres finished their speeches, the crowd waiting in expectant\nsilence. Two men appeared, flanked by policemen. They wore cheap suits\nand their hands were cuffed behind their backs. The police marched them\nhalfway down the steps of the auditorium, where they stood between the\ncadres and the crowd. The two men’s heads were bowed. The students had\npressed to the front; at the back stood the peasants and the mothers with their\nbabies. Everybody was quiet. In the background, from the Wu River, I heard\nthe low growl of riverboat horns.\nOne of the cadres read from a sheet of paper. His voice echoed over the\nplaza, and in response the crowd shifted and murmured. The two men kept\ntheir heads down.\n“A few days,” Teacher Kong said. “Only a few days in jail. Not very\nserious.”\n\nAnd in that instant it was over: the cops took the handcuffed men out the\nfront gate, where a bus was waiting; the cadres disappeared; the tables were\nwhisked away; the banner was taken down; the students returned to class.\nThe people in Fuling were extremely organized with public events and their\nrallies could materialize and disappear in the space of an hour. Within fifteen\nminutes there was no sign that anything had happened in the plaza.\nTeacher Kong and I reviewed some vocabulary from the trial, and then\nwe moved on to Lesson Thirty-one. There was something strange about\nreturning so quickly to class after having watched the sentencing from high\nabove, as from a luxury box at a stadium, turning somebody’s public\nhumiliation into a vocabulary lesson. But many things were public in Fuling\nand few locals would have found it unusual. I had Peace Corps friends at\nanother Sichuan teachers college who, the following spring, had their classes\ncanceled one afternoon for a pre-execution rally in the school’s sports\nstadium. Student attendance at the event was mandatory, because the\ncriminals were young drug dealers and their deaths would provide a valuable\nlesson for the spectators. The college gathered in the stadium, where the\npolice paraded the condemned prisoners in front of the students. Afterward\nthe criminals were taken away to the countryside and shot. Classes resumed\nas normal the next day.\nNOT LONG AFTER the sentencing, I came back from a run and realized\nthat the sign in the center of campus had become completely intelligible. This\nwas a moment I had always looked forward to—from the beginning, I had\nseen that string of characters as a benchmark, and I traced my progress in the\nway those words became meaningful. And one day all of it finally made\nsense:\nTeaching Educates the People, Administration Educates the People,\nService Educates the People, Environment Educates the People\nI stopped and took a long look. I read the sign again, waiting for the sense\n\nof achievement. But nothing was there—it was simply propaganda, the same\nsort of trite phrase that could be found in the students’ textbooks or on\nbillboards all across the city. I would react the same way when the other\nmessages on the way to Raise the Flag Mountain came into focus:\nConstruct a Spiritual Civilization, Replace the Old Concept of\nGiving Birth\nControlling Population Growth Promotes Social Development\nEducation Is the Foundation upon Which a Powerful Nation Is Built\nAll of it was the same old cant. Every time one of the signs became\nintelligible, I felt very little of the satisfaction that I had once imagined.\nInstead I heard Teacher Liao’s voice in my head: Read the next one. You\nhaven’t achieved anything yet. And so I kept writing the characters over and\nover again at my desk, gazing out my window at the city.\nLATE ONE AFTERNOON in December, Adam and I were summoned to\nthe English department office, where we were informed that there would be a\nbanquet tonight. These announcements were always made at the last minute,\nand they meant that the evening was effectively finished, because it was\nimpossible to go to a banquet and not get hopelessly drunk.\nA good part of our Peace Corps medical training had involved\npreparation for these moments. Even though we were only the third Peace\nCorps China group, the Sichuan countryside was already littered with tales of\nvolunteers who had become banquet casualties. There were stories of fights,\nof vandalism, of volunteers who had become so dangerously intoxicated that\nthey forever swore off drinking at such occasions. Our medical officer\nstrongly recommended that after arriving at site we establish ourselves as\nnondrinkers, at least as far as banquets were concerned.\nThe most frequently performed procedure in Sichuanese emergency\nrooms was stomach-pumping. The vast majority of these patients were male,\nbecause drinking, like smoking, was an important part of being a man. This\n\nwas true in many parts of China, especially in the more remote regions, and\nSichuan drinking wasn’t simply a casual way to relax. Often it was\ncompetitive, and usually it involved baijiu, a powerful and foul-tasting grain\nalcohol. Men toasted each other with full shots, and there was a tendency for\nthis drinking to turn into a kind of bullying, the participants goading each\nother until somebody got sick. One of our Peace Corps training sessions had\ninvolved personal testimony from a Sichuanese man, who shrugged\nsheepishly and explained that even good friends were perfectly willing to\ndrink each other into the hospital. Like the medical officer, he recommended\nthat we use our waiguoren status to avoid this ritual entirely.\nIt was a typical Peace Corps scenario: having been told a wealth of horror\nstories about the pointless machismo of Sichuanese drinking, Adam and I\nwere promptly sent down the river to the most remote Peace Corps site in the\nprovince. At our welcoming banquet, when we were served our first shot of\nbaijiu, neither of us hesitated for even a second. Our training had repeatedly\nemphasized that this was critical to whatever it took to be a man in a place\nlike Fuling, and as far as we were concerned this was part of our job. We\nhadn’t come all this way just to be waiguoren. We downed the shot, and we\ndowned the next one, too.\nDuring that first month we had two or three banquets a week, and soon I\ncould see that all of the drinking was organized with remarkable intricacy\nThe faculty took it easy on us at the beginning, no doubt because the Peace\nCorps had given all the colleges a stern warning about responsibility. But\neventually our colleagues came to the same conclusion that we had: the Peace\nCorps was far away. Steadily the pressure to drink increased, and as time\npassed I realized that the English department had an alcoholic leaderboard.\nThis wasn’t a literal leaderboard in the sense of being written down, but it\nwas completely public and accepted. You could ask any teacher where his\nalcohol tolerance stood in relation to everybody else’s in the department, and\nhe would answer with well-tested precision. Party Secretary Zhang was at the\ntop, followed by Albert, then Dean Fu, and so on through the ranks until you\ncame to Teacher Sai, who was such a lightweight that people referred to him\nscornfully as “Miss Sai” during banquets.\nWithin three weeks Adam was the undisputed number one drinker in the\nEnglish department. I was ranked second; Party Secretary Zhang slipped to\nthird. In truth I wasn’t much of a drinker at home, but Fuling tolerance levels\n\ntended to be low, because many residents have a genetic intolerance of\nalcohol that is common among Asians. Even Party Secretary Zhang, despite\nhis lofty ranking, turned bright red after a few drinks. This was one reason\nwhy local drinking patterns were so abusive with relatively light\nconsequences; most people were genetically unable to become alcoholics.\nOnce or twice a week they might be able to drink heavily, but they got too\nsick to do it all the time. It was a ritual rather than a habit.\nIn a pathetic way, drinking became one small thing that Adam and I were\ngood at, although it was difficult to take much pride in this. If anything, it\nsaid a great deal about our troubles adjusting to Fuling life, because the\nbanquets and the drinking, despite their strange childishness, represented one\nof our more comfortable environments. We gained instant respect for our\ntolerance levels, and to a certain degree this was how the department\nauthorities communicated with us. If they had something important to tell us,\nor if a request needed to be made, it was handled at a banquet. Our\ncolleagues, who usually seemed stiff and nervous around the waiguoren,\nloosened up once the baijiu started flowing. These events were strictly all-\nmale—the only women involved were the waitresses who served the baijiu.\nBefore the December banquet, Adam and I were escorted into the English\ndepartment office to meet our hosts for the evening. Two men stood up and\nshook our hands, smiling. One of them was a tall handsome man in his forties\nand the other was a short older man of perhaps sixty years. The tall man wore\na new sweater, and from the way he carried himself it was clear that he was\nimportant—a cadre. It was also just as obvious that they were here to make\nsome request of us, because they were sponsoring the meal. Teacher Sai and\nDean Fu were there to translate.\n“This is Mr. Wang from the Chinese department,” Teacher Sai said. “Mr.\nWang came to the college in 1977—he was part of the first class when the\ncollege opened after the Great Cultural Revolution. He was the best English\nstudent, but English was not a preferred subject in those days. So he became\na Chinese professor instead. But he is still very interested in English.”\nAdam and I shook Teacher Wang’s hand again. Teacher Sai seemed to\nhave forgotten the other man, who didn’t appear to be offended. Obviously\nhe was accustomed to moving in the bigger man’s wake.\nAll of us sat down. Adam and I waited for the request; cynically I\nassumed that Teacher Wang wanted English lessons. Already I could imagine",

I asked him what he meant.\n“Mr. Wang is the editor of the college literary magazine,” said Dean Fu.\n“He has more than ten thousand books.”\nHe paused to let the number sink in. Then he leaned forward and spoke in\na low voice. “Mr. Wang,” he said, “has the most books of anybody in Fuling\nTeachers College.”\nA proud smile flickered across Teacher Wang’s face and I could see that\nhe understood what had been said.

He shook his head again.\n“No, no, no,” said Party Secretary Zhang. “You must do it for our\nguests.”\n“I can’t.”\nThey were speaking English for our benefit, but then they shifted to\nChinese. While arguing they fought over the cup—Teacher Sai tried to push\nit away while Party Secretary Zhang held it firmly on the table. Dean Fu and\nTeacher Wang grinned. They joined in, scoffing at Teacher Sai until at last he\npicked up the shot glass. Everybody watched.\nIt took him a long time to drain the cup. He drank it in three painful sips,\nand after the last one he gasped and coughed. He put the cup back down on\nthe table. Within seconds the waitress was there to refill it. Teacher Sai\nquickly put his hand over the cup, shaking his head.\n“That is enough,” he said.\nParty Secretary Zhang tried to pry Teacher Sai’s hand away. The waitress\nstood by patiently, bottle in hand. It was a quintessentially Sichuanese scene\n—for every scroll painting of a lovely river they could have had ten depicting\nbaijiu arguments, two men scrabbling over a cup while a young woman\nwaited with a bottle.\n“Seriously,” Teacher Sai said. “That is enough for me.”\n“Miss Sai,” taunted Party Secretary Zhang, pulling at his hand.\n“Miss Sai,” echoed Dean Fu, grinning.\nTeacher Wang said something and everybody laughed. For a few minutes\nthe entire table was focused on Teacher Sai’s cup. It was hard to believe that\nless than an hour ago we had been talking about Saul Bellow and Joyce Carol"

The boats are wood, with arched roofs of bamboo and woven reeds.\nEach roof is less than three feet tall at the highest point, reducing wind drag\nand avoiding a structure that could tip the craft, which has no keel. The boats\nare light and narrow, low-gunneled, with virtually no freeboard, and they are\neasily maneuvered in the river’s current. Their design has not changed greatly\nsince people first began carving on the rock to which the sampans are\ntethered.\nFour women chat in the prow of a boat. All of them wear simple jackets\nof blue, and their clothes, like the boats, are dirty. They are river people who\nlive on their sampans; for most of the year they depend on fishing, but winter\nfish are sluggish and the owners of these crafts spend the season on the ridge.\nThey rely on tourism, using small rowboats to ferry visitors back and forth\nfrom shore.\nToday is a holiday and more than fifty visitors are wandering up and\ndown the sandstone, gazing at the inscriptions. Occasionally they will ask a\nquestion of one of the eight workers stationed on the ridge, who have been\nsent here by the Fuling City Cultural Relics Administration. Two of these\nstaff members have some formal education in archaeology, while the others\nare common workers whose job is to sell snacks, oversee the rowboats, and,\nfor two yuan, take photographs of visitors next to the ridge’s biggest carved\nfish.\nA cold wind runs down the corridor of the river valley, and the workers\nhuddle around their snack table, shivering and drinking hot tea. They watch\nthe Yangtze closely, measuring its level every day. Undoubtedly they dream\nof the river rising, because whenever it covers the carvings they can return to\nthe indoors work of their government office in town. For them, the\nappearance of the stone carp augurs nothing more than long cold days of\nexile out on the river."

And the Yangtze isn’t just water; the\nriver carries a thousand times as much silt as the muddy Mississippi. Cities\nlike Chongqing and Fuling spew their sewage more or less untreated into the\nriver, as well as waste from their factories, and there is speculation that all of\nthis filth and silt will back up behind the dam. A ten-thousand-ton ship won’t\nbe of much use in a four-hundred-mile-long bog.\nFor these and other reasons, the project has long inspired apocalyptic\nvisions from a host of experts, both Chinese and foreign. They envision a\nbroken dam, a silt-filled reservoir; they warn that the rising river will carry\nnew poisons that previously had been stored on its banks. The reservoir will\nflood thirteen cities, 140 towns, and 1,352 villages; it will swamp 650\nfactories and 139 power stations. For more than ten thousand years the river\nvalley has been home to human civilization, and all of man’s endless traces,\nthe garbage dumps and the chemical deposits, will be held stagnant in the\nnew reservoir. And the river isn’t something to be tinkered with lightly—over\n350 million people live in the Yangtze’s watershed, more than in America\nand Canada combined, one person out of every twelve on earth.\nExperts warn that mercury, lead, and other poisons from the flooded areas\ncould be carried into people’s water supplies, and they fear the outbreak of\nendemic infections along the soggy new valley: malaria, leptospirosis,\nJapanese B encephalitis. The dam’s forty thousand construction workers, all\nof whom are living temporary lives in temporary housing, will spread\ngonorrhea via the prostitutes who flock to the workers’ cities.

And the Yangtze isn’t just water; the\nriver carries a thousand times as much silt as the muddy Mississippi. Cities\nlike Chongqing and Fuling spew their sewage more or less untreated into the\nriver, as well as waste from their factories, and there is speculation that all of\nthis filth and silt will back up behind the dam. A ten-thousand-ton ship won’t\nbe of much use in a four-hundred-mile-long bog.\nFor these and other reasons, the project has long inspired apocalyptic\nvisions from a host of experts, both Chinese and foreign. They envision a\nbroken dam, a silt-filled reservoir; they warn that the rising river will carry\nnew poisons that previously had been stored on its banks. The reservoir will\nflood thirteen cities, 140 towns, and 1,352 villages; it will swamp 650\nfactories and 139 power stations. For more than ten thousand years the river\nvalley has been home to human civilization, and all of man’s endless traces,\nthe garbage dumps and the chemical deposits, will be held stagnant in the\nnew reservoir. And the river isn’t something to be tinkered with lightly—over\n350 million people live in the Yangtze’s watershed, more than in America\nand Canada combined, one person out of every twelve on earth.\nExperts warn that mercury, lead, and other poisons from the flooded areas\ncould be carried into people’s water supplies, and they fear the outbreak of\nendemic infections along the soggy new valley: malaria, leptospirosis,\nJapanese B encephalitis. The dam’s forty thousand construction workers, all\nof whom are living temporary lives in temporary housing, will spread\ngonorrhea via the prostitutes who flock to the workers’ cities. AIDS could\nrun the same course. And where will these workers go when the dam is\nfinished?\nAnd what about the nearly two million people, mostly peasants, who will\nbe displaced by the new reservoir?

Never before had\nsuch a massive country reorganized its economy on such a scale—even\nStalin’s first Five-Year Plan couldn’t compare—and according to some\nestimates, the Third Line did more damage to China’s economy than the\nCultural Revolution.\nDespite its enormous scale, the project had been developed and\ndismantled in remarkable secrecy, as few locals in Fuling and the other Third\nLine towns ever had a clear notion of what was going on. They knew that\ncommands were coming in from Beijing, and that these commands were\nbringing factories from Shanghai; and they also knew that all of this had a\nmilitary sensitivity that required secrecy.

The Third Line had\nalways been a huge drain on the economy; in some years as much as 50\npercent of China’s capital budget was spent on the project. Never before had\nsuch a massive country reorganized its economy on such a scale—even\nStalin’s first Five-Year Plan couldn’t compare—and according to some\nestimates, the Third Line did more damage to China’s economy than the\nCultural Revolution.\nDespite its enormous scale, the project had been developed and\ndismantled in remarkable secrecy, as few locals in Fuling and the other Third\nLine towns ever had a clear notion of what was going on. They knew that\ncommands were coming in from Beijing, and that these commands were\nbringing factories from Shanghai; and they also knew that all of this had a\nmilitary sensitivity that required secrecy.

Even the Yangtze has been tamed\nbefore, albeit on a much smaller scale; the Gezhou Dam was completed in\n1981 on a site downstream from the location of the current project.\nBut there is also the history of Henan province, where heavy rains in\n1975 caused sixty-two modern dams to fall like dominoes, one after another,\nand 230,000 people died. Although the scale of that particular disaster was\nunique, the poor engineering was less unusual: 3,200 Chinese dams have\nburst since 1949. In this century, the failure rate of Chinese dams is 3.7\npercent, compared to 0.6 percent in the rest of the world.\nIn the end I was like most people in Fuling—I passively watched the\npreparations for the project, and I tried not to be too judgmental. I was, after\nall, an outsider. But I figured it was better to be there before the dam than\nafterward, and it was good to see the White Crane Ridge and the Three\nGorges before the river was tamed. There was man’s history and there was\nthe Yangtze’s, and I didn’t particularly want to be there when they clashed,\nchanging the place forever.\nTHE SEMESTER FINISHED near the end of January, and we had four\nweeks off for the Spring Festival Holiday. Adam and I could go anywhere we\nwished—other volunteers were going to Japan, Thailand, Laos—but for us it\nwas easiest to go downstream, which was where we went.\nWe bought tickets on the afternoon Jiangyu boat because we had been\ntold not to. Our colleagues had warned us against those ships; they were dirty\nand crowded and served primarily as transportation for people who lived\nalong the river. They didn’t stop at the temples and interesting sights, like the\ntourist ships, and there wouldn’t be other waiguoren. All of that sounded\ngood—I had already seen enough temples, and the cliffs of the Gorges would\nlook the same from any boat. Mostly I was interested in catching a glimpse of\naverage life on the river.\nPreviously the Jiangyu line had been called “The East is Red,” in honor\nof the song praising Mao Zedong, but now there was a great deal of"

This was a ritual at every Chinese\nnature site; there seemed to be no value in the natural world unless it was\nlinked to man—some shape that a mountain recalled, or a poem that had been\nwritten about it, or an ancient legend that brought the rocks to life.\nThe guide also pointed out the tiny square holes that had been carved into\nthe cliff twenty feet above the river, where in ancient days there had been a\nplank road for the trackers who hauled the boats upstream. Legend said that it\nwas along this route that the Tang Dynasty concubine Yang Guifei had her\nfavorite lichees transported in the late ninth century, heading north to the\ncapital of Chang’an. In those days, Fuling’s lichees were considered the best\nin China—even today that is still one of Fuling’s nicknames, the Lichee City\n—and for Yang Guifei the fruit was carried down the Yangtze and up the\nDaning. She was one of Chinese history’s Four Great Beauties, the sort of\nwoman for whom lichees travel great distances, and her charms so beguiled\nthe Emperor Xuanzong that his control over the country’s affairs loosened\nuntil at last rebellion broke out. The emperor fled to Sichuan, and Yang\nGuifei tried to follow, but soldiers captured her and forced her to hang\nherself. The heartbroken emperor died in exile, and his son’s effort to\nmaintain control failed, and the Tang Dynasty, after ruling for nearly three\ncenturies, collapsed—all for the love of a beautiful woman who liked Fuling\nlichees.\nWe cruised north through the Daning’s Small Three Gorges, the river\nclear and bright in the morning sunshine. The empty hay boats were making\ntheir way back upstream, the peasants wading in the shallows and towing\ntheir craft by rope through the rapids. Golden monkeys scrambled over the\ncliffs of the Bawu Gorge, swinging heavily from bushes and calling out on\nthe banks behind us.\nSeveral times the boat stopped at concrete docks, where we disembarked\nand were ushered along new-built walkways, bordered by stand after stand of\npeasants selling the same goods: Three Gorges postcards, Three Gorges\nvideos, painted rocks, grinning Buddhas, fake jade bracelets, fake ancient"

The journey will take seven days.\n“Usually we don’t go that far,” says the owner of the boat. “Usually we\ngo to Hunan—we take these barrels downriver and then we bring back\nfeldspar for the ceramics factory. It takes about five days to get to Hunan.\nThat’s Chairman Mao’s home province, did you know? We usually stop\nabout half an hour from his hometown of Shaoshan. No, I’ve never been\nthere. But Hunan is good—it’s better than here. The transportation is more\ndeveloped, and so is the economy. It’s flatter there—it’s not a mountainous\nregion like this. Fuling has bad transportation. Most places I’ve seen in China\nare more developed than here.”\nThe man is forty-three years old, and without talking to him it would be\ndifficult to guess that he is the owner of the boat. He wears a dirty gray suit\nand tennis shoes, and he squats on the deck, smoking Magnificent Sound\ncigarettes. He smokes the cheap ones, the four-yuan packs that are the\nstandard for Fuling’s laobaixing, Old Hundred Names, the common folk. His\nhands are dirty. His shoulders are broad and strong. He is a hands-on boss; he\nsupervises the loading, and he rides down the Yangtze with the other eight\nworkers who make up his crew. Clearly he is close to the other men, and he\ncarries himself more or less as one of their equals—in fact, he is slow to\nacknowledge that the boat is his. But the others treat him with a quiet respect,\nand when a stranger approaches it is the boss who does most of the talking.\n“Two of the workers can drive,” he says. “I can’t, but you only need two\n—one to drive and one to rest.

            "Soon they will be bound for the city of Jiangyin in Jiangsu province, a\nthousand miles down the Yangtze. They will float under the cliffs of the\nThree Gorges, past the lowlands and lakes of central China, and on toward\nthe country’s far east. The journey will take seven days.\n“Usually we don’t go that far,” says the owner of the boat. “Usually we\ngo to Hunan—we take these barrels downriver and then we bring back\nfeldspar for the ceramics factory. It takes about five days to get to Hunan.\nThat’s Chairman Mao’s home province, did you know? We usually stop\nabout half an hour from his hometown of Shaoshan. No, I’ve never been\nthere. But Hunan is good—it’s better than here. The transportation is more\ndeveloped, and so is the economy. It’s flatter there—it’s not a mountainous\nregion like this. Fuling has bad transportation. Most places I’ve seen in China\nare more developed than here.”\nThe man is forty-three years old, and without talking to him it would be\ndifficult to guess that he is the owner of the boat. He wears a dirty gray suit\nand tennis shoes, and he squats on the deck, smoking Magnificent Sound\ncigarettes. He smokes the cheap ones, the four-yuan packs that are the\nstandard for Fuling’s laobaixing, Old Hundred Names, the common folk. His\nhands are dirty. His shoulders are broad and strong. He is a hands-on boss; he\nsupervises the loading, and he rides down the Yangtze with the other eight\nworkers who make up his crew. Clearly he is close to the other men, and he\ncarries himself more or less as one of their equals—in fact, he is slow to\nacknowledge that the boat is his. But the others treat him with a quiet respect,\nand when a stranger approaches it is the boss who does most of the talking.\n“Two of the workers can drive,” he says. “I can’t, but you only need two\n—one to drive and one to rest. It’s harder to drive a boat than a car, you\nknow. It only takes two or three months of studying to learn to drive a car,\nbut on the river it takes five years before you’re ready for the examination. A\nlicense costs ten thousand yuan.

I felt that a mature\npolitician who had maintained a high position throughout the Cultural\nRevolution could not be an entirely good man, just as any adult German who\nhad risen in the Nazi hierarchy was at least partly complicit in its crimes. But\nfor the Chinese, this was an over-simplification; they were more likely to see\na politician like Zhou as an Oskar Schindler—a man who recognized the\nsystem as wrong but worked from within to temper its ill effects. There is a\nsort of pragmatic heroism in such figures, and the Chinese have always been\npragmatists, much more so than Westerners.\nI was much more sympathetic, though, to Deng Xiaoping’s brand of\npragmatism. He had his share of flaws—he had been prominent in the Anti-\nRightist campaigns of the late 1950s, when Mao solidified his hold on the\ncountry, and of course Deng had approved the violent repression of the 1989\nprotests. But at least he was capable of departing from the Party line, which\nhe proved during the Cultural Revolution, when he stepped away from the\nfawning example of Zhou Enlai and criticized the movement. As a result,\nDeng was purged, his family was punished, and his son was thrown out of a\nwindow. His criticism wasn’t very political, but he wasn’t the sort of man\nwho was interested in politics for its own sake. And he was a survivor—\nalbeit in a very different way from Zhou Enlai. I liked this about him, and\nespecially I liked Deng Xiaoping because he reflected what I admired most\nabout the Sichuanese—their toughness and their lack of pretension.

I felt that a mature\npolitician who had maintained a high position throughout the Cultural\nRevolution could not be an entirely good man, just as any adult German who\nhad risen in the Nazi hierarchy was at least partly complicit in its crimes. But\nfor the Chinese, this was an over-simplification; they were more likely to see\na politician like Zhou as an Oskar Schindler—a man who recognized the\nsystem as wrong but worked from within to temper its ill effects. There is a\nsort of pragmatic heroism in such figures, and the Chinese have always been\npragmatists, much more so than Westerners.\nI was much more sympathetic, though, to Deng Xiaoping’s brand of\npragmatism. He had his share of flaws—he had been prominent in the Anti-\nRightist campaigns of the late 1950s, when Mao solidified his hold on the\ncountry, and of course Deng had approved the violent repression of the 1989\nprotests. But at least he was capable of departing from the Party line, which\nhe proved during the Cultural Revolution, when he stepped away from the\nfawning example of Zhou Enlai and criticized the movement. As a result,\nDeng was purged, his family was punished, and his son was thrown out of a\nwindow. His criticism wasn’t very political, but he wasn’t the sort of man\nwho was interested in politics for its own sake. And he was a survivor—\nalbeit in a very different way from Zhou Enlai. I liked this about him, and\nespecially I liked Deng Xiaoping because he reflected what I admired most\nabout the Sichuanese—their toughness and their lack of pretension.

One chapter\nfeatured a political debate between two fictional American students of\nChinese, one of whom asked how it was possible that China could be a\ndemocratic country when it was led by only one party. The other American\nstudent, named John, answered:\nWhy can’t a country led by a single party achieve a high level of\ndemocracy? The Chinese Communist Party represents the interests of\nevery group, and the Chinese people enjoy wide-ranging democratic\nrights.\nWhen we reviewed that lesson one day in class, Teacher Kong paused\nand ran his finger over the paragraph. “Some people,” he said, “would not\nagree with that.”\nI said that I didn’t know much about it, although most Americans had\ntheir own opinions about Chinese politics.\n“What do most Americans think?” he asked.\n“Most Americans think that China is not a democratic country.”\nI wouldn’t have said that to any of my students, or anybody on the street,\nbut it was different with Teacher Kong. I knew he wasn’t a dissident—and\nindeed he would join the Communist Party himself the next year—but he was\nslow to judge and he could listen to ideas without either flatly accepting or\nrefuting them. In Fuling those were rare qualities.\n“Our China is different from America, I think,” he said. “The education\nlevel in America is higher. Most of the Chinese are peasants, and if they\nchose our leaders directly it would be dangerous, because anybody could lie\nto them, or trick them. China isn’t ready for that yet.

            "It was a Chinese-published book with a Chinese political agenda, which\nmade the classes much more interesting, because the vocabulary was useful\nand I could watch the way my tutors reacted to the material. One chapter\nfeatured a political debate between two fictional American students of\nChinese, one of whom asked how it was possible that China could be a\ndemocratic country when it was led by only one party. The other American\nstudent, named John, answered:\nWhy can’t a country led by a single party achieve a high level of\ndemocracy? The Chinese Communist Party represents the interests of\nevery group, and the Chinese people enjoy wide-ranging democratic\nrights.\nWhen we reviewed that lesson one day in class, Teacher Kong paused\nand ran his finger over the paragraph. “Some people,” he said, “would not\nagree with that.”\nI said that I didn’t know much about it, although most Americans had\ntheir own opinions about Chinese politics.\n“What do most Americans think?” he asked.\n“Most Americans think that China is not a democratic country.”\nI wouldn’t have said that to any of my students, or anybody on the street,\nbut it was different with Teacher Kong. I knew he wasn’t a dissident—and\nindeed he would join the Communist Party himself the next year—but he was\nslow to judge and he could listen to ideas without either flatly accepting or\nrefuting them. In Fuling those were rare qualities.\n“Our China is different from America, I think,” he said. “The education\nlevel in America is higher. Most of the Chinese are peasants, and if they\nchose our leaders directly it would be dangerous, because anybody could lie\nto them, or trick them. China isn’t ready for that yet. But that’s just my\nopinion—I don’t know if it’s correct or not.”\nHe appeared to be slightly uncomfortable with the subject and I didn’t\npursue it.

Sorry.”\nI picked up the dictionary again and fumbled through it until I found the\ncorrect term: gu’er. I apologized again for the mistake and she seemed\nrelieved; yes, she said, Li Peng had been adopted by Zhou Enlai. I left it at\nthat—I was embarrassed to have pushed her so far, even if it had been partly\nunintentional. The next class she asked me pointedly why the American\ngovernment helped its athletes take performance-enhancing drugs, and we\nwent around again, this time with me on the defensive. And so it went every\nother week, our Opium Wars raging as the countdown to Hong Kong’s return\ndrew closer and closer."

        "myself sitting in this cadre’s office, bored to tears while he said, slowly,\n“How-are-you?”\n“Mr. Wang has heard that you studied literature,” Dean Fu said. “He\nwants to ask you some questions about American literature.”\nThis took me by surprise. I asked him what he meant.\n“Mr. Wang is the editor of the college literary magazine,” said Dean Fu.\n“He has more than ten thousand books.”\nHe paused to let the number sink in. Then he leaned forward and spoke in\na low voice. “Mr. Wang,” he said, “has the most books of anybody in Fuling\nTeachers College.”\nA proud smile flickered across Teacher Wang’s face and I could see that\nhe understood what had been said. I wondered if Sichuanese men had book\nrankings as well as alcohol rankings, and what the relationship might be\nbetween these two sources of prestige. This was all uncharted territory—in\nPeace Corps training nobody had warned us about books.\nI said that I knew less about American literature than English literature,\nbut I’d try to answer his questions. Teacher Wang nodded and shot off his\nfirst query in Chinese to Dean Fu, who translated.\n“Mr. Wang has a question about Saul Bellow,” he announced. “Does the\naverage American understand his books?”\nI said that I had read very little of Bellow’s work, but my impression was\nthat his style was accessible, and that he was considered one of the best\nJewish American writers and a voice of Chicago. Teacher Wang nodded, as if\nthis was what he had expected to hear. He had another question ready.\n“What about Joyce Carol Oates?” Dean Fu said. “Do you think that she\nfollows in the tradition of Virginia Woolf?”\n“Not really,” I said. “Most people say that Joyce Carol Oates isn’t a\nfeminist writer. Actually, some feminists criticize her.”\nThis led us to a discussion on feminism, followed by Toni Morrison and\nblack women writers, and then we came to southern literature. After that we\ntalked about Hemingway and the “Dirty Realism” of authors like Raymond\nCarver and Tobias Wolff. All of it was translated through Dean Fu, and as we\ntalked I realized that he had an even more impressive knowledge of American\nliterature than I had thought. I also realized that I was a jackass for assuming\nthat the ten-thousand-book Teacher Wang needed my help to say “How-are-\nyou.”",
        "After half an hour we moved to the banquet hall. The first toast was a\ngeneral one, for everybody at the table, and then Teacher Wang gave Adam\nand me a special toast. Party Secretary Zhang followed with another shot for\nthe entire party. When the next toast came around, Teacher Sai pushed his\ncup away and grinned nervously.\n“I can’t drink any more,” he said. “That is enough.”\n“Drink it,” said Party Secretary Zhang. “All of it.”\n“You know that I do not drink,” Teacher Sai said. He brought his hands\ntogether and bowed his head quickly in a pleading gesture. Teacher Sai was\none of the brightest of the department teachers, a pudgy man in his forties\nwho was always smiling. Tonight his face was already bright red after two\nshots. He shook his head again.\n“No, no, no,” said Party Secretary Zhang. “You must do it for our\nguests.”\n“I can’t.”\nThey were speaking English for our benefit, but then they shifted to\nChinese. While arguing they fought over the cup—Teacher Sai tried to push\nit away while Party Secretary Zhang held it firmly on the table. Dean Fu and\nTeacher Wang grinned. They joined in, scoffing at Teacher Sai until at last he\npicked up the shot glass. Everybody watched.\nIt took him a long time to drain the cup. He drank it in three painful sips,\nand after the last one he gasped and coughed. He put the cup back down on\nthe table. Within seconds the waitress was there to refill it. Teacher Sai\nquickly put his hand over the cup, shaking his head.\n“That is enough,” he said.\nParty Secretary Zhang tried to pry Teacher Sai’s hand away. The waitress\nstood by patiently, bottle in hand. It was a quintessentially Sichuanese scene\n—for every scroll painting of a lovely river they could have had ten depicting\nbaijiu arguments, two men scrabbling over a cup while a young woman\nwaited with a bottle.\n“Seriously,” Teacher Sai said. “That is enough for me.”\n“Miss Sai,” taunted Party Secretary Zhang, pulling at his hand.\n“Miss Sai,” echoed Dean Fu, grinning.\nTeacher Wang said something and everybody laughed. For a few minutes\nthe entire table was focused on Teacher Sai’s cup. It was hard to believe that\nless than an hour ago we had been talking about Saul Bellow and Joyce Carol",
        "Oates. Finally Teacher Sai relented.\n“Only one more,” he said. “This is the last one.”\nThe waitress filled his cup. Teacher Wang smiled and turned his attention\ntoward Adam and me. He made a quick gesture, holding up his cup, and the\nthree of us drank. Teacher Wang downed the baijiu easily and he was not\nturning red.\nThe food came and for a while the shots slowed. When they resumed,\neverybody had forgotten about Teacher Sai, who was only good\nentertainment at the start and finish of a banquet. He was too much hassle\nonce the serious drinking started and now he sat sipping tea while the baijiu\nflowed in earnest.\nThere was strategy to this part of the banquet and usually the shots were\npreceded by low murmurings, the teachers speaking the Sichuan dialect while\nAdam and I muttered English back and forth. The trick was to get a two-for-\none—if Party Secretary Zhang toasted both Adam and me, then we would\nboth drink and immediately afterward Dean Fu could do the same. Our\nresponse was to hit them with a preemptive strike; if we sensed that they\nwere plotting, one of us would toast the pair, or the entire table, and then they\nwould have to recover before resuming the attack. Occasionally they tried to\nfocus on me, sensing weakness, but when that happened Adam would step in\nand cover me. That was acceptable in Sichuan—a friend could take a shot for\nyou. Sichuanese drinking was a lot like war.\nEvery banquet had a leader, a sort of alcoholic alpha male who controlled\nthe direction of the baijiu. Party Secretary Zhang always led the English-\ndepartment events, but tonight he deferred to Teacher Wang. The big man\nworked quickly and with surprising fairness, toasting the entire table until the\nother teachers started to weaken. After that he focused on Adam and me,\nscorning the usual two-for-one as he traded personal shots between the two of\nus. It was a remarkable exhibition. After half an hour the three of us were still\nthe most sober at the table, but I was fading quickly and Teacher Wang\nshowed no signs of slowing. I heard Dean Fu and Party Secretary Zhang\nasking him to ease up, because they were afraid I would get sick, and at last\nthe flurry of toasts ended.\nTeacher Wang began to tell a long story. It was about a pedicab and he\ntold it in Sichuanese while Teacher Sai translated. The story moved slowly\nand I was too drunk to listen carefully. My gaze wandered across the table",
        "until I found myself looking at the little man who had come with Teacher\nWang. I had forgotten entirely about him and now he smiled. He said\nsomething, but I couldn’t understand; he was a dialect speaker and in any\ncase the baijiu had not improved either of our language abilities. Finally he\nconcentrated very hard, pronouncing four Mandarin syllables clearly.\n“Sha shi bi ya,” he said.\n“I’m sorry,” I said in Chinese. “What did you say?”\n“Sha shi bi ya.”\nI shook my head and he repeated it a few more times, gesturing as if he\nwere reading a book. Finally something clicked in my mind.\n“Shakespeare?” I said.\nHe laughed and gave me the thumbs up. “Di gen si.”\n“Dickens?”\nHe nodded and laughed again.\n“Ma ke tu wen.”\n“Mark Twain.”\nSlowly we made our way through Melville, Norris, O’Connor, and\nCheever. It took me a long time to guess Norris and Cheever. There wasn’t\nanything else that we were able to talk about and I never learned the little\nman’s name, although he was able to communicate that he especially liked\nthe Norris novel McTeague, which is perhaps the only great American novel\nabout a dentist. Nowadays hardly anybody in America reads Norris but there\nwas at least one fan along the Upper Yangtze.\nTeacher Wang finished with the pedicab story. Even though I had missed\nmost of it I could gather that it was about a time when he was very drunk and\nspent half an hour negotiating with a pedicab, only to realize that he was\nalready in front of his hotel. All of the men laughed at the story. Listening to\nits translation reminded them that Teacher Sai was still there.\n“Drink,” said Party Secretary Zhang, pointing at Teacher Sai’s cup.\n“I can’t.”\n“Drink.”\n“I can’t.”\n“Yes.”\n“No.”\n“Drink.”\n“I’m sorry.”",
        "“Miss Sai!”\n“Miss Sai!”\nFinally he shuddered through another shot. It was clear that the banquet\nwas breaking up, and Teacher Wang held his cup up to Adam and me. We\nraised our glasses.\n“To books,” I said.\nBut Teacher Wang had something else in mind. He spoke to me,\nseriously now, and Teacher Sai translated.\n“Mr. Wang,” he said, “wants you to write something for the college\nmagazine.”\nOur cups were frozen above the table.\n“What do you mean?”\n“He wants you to write an article about literature.”\n“American or English? And how long?”\nThey discussed this quickly. Our three cups were still in midair; it was\nwithout question the most favorable instant for a request.\n“American is better,” said Teacher Sai. “Only about ten thousand words.”\nI caught my breath. “I don’t know American literature well enough for\nthat,” I said. “Tell him I can do either Elizabethan poetry or Charles Dickens,\nbecause that’s what I studied at Oxford. Or Shakespeare. But otherwise it\nwould be difficult. I don’t have many notes here.”\nThere was another discussion. My arm was growing heavy. Teacher\nWang nodded.\n“Dickens,” said Teacher Sai. “Ten thousand words.”\nWe drank the shot. The baijiu was starting to taste dangerously foul and I\nshuddered after it was down. A good banquet was like a good short story:\nthere was always a point, but you didn’t quite understand it until the very\nend. Now I realized why we had been invited tonight, but I wasn’t resentful;\nat least now I knew how a Sichuanese literary journal recruited new material.\nThe table bullied Teacher Sai for a few more minutes and then all of us\nstaggered out.\nI HOPED THAT EVERYBODY would forget about the promised essay,\nbut within a week the quiet reminders started. I delayed, explaining that I was",
        "busy with teaching, but then I began to receive messages about Teacher\nWang’s impending deadline. Finally I sat down and wrote what he wanted,\nwhich was an essay about Dickens’ relationship to political reform.\nI wrote it as quickly as possible. I argued that Dickens was essentially a\nmiddle-class figure who liked writing about social problems not because he\nwanted revolutionary change, but rather because these subjects made for\ngood creative material. I knew the Marxists wouldn’t like this approach, so I\nadded a line that accused Dickens of being a Capitalist Roader. I liked being\nable to use that term in a literary essay. Otherwise the article was not very\nenjoyable to write, and I loaded the descriptions in order to jack up the word\ncount. Teacher Sai had to translate it into Chinese. For a solid week he\nstruggled with the damn thing, coming into my office with questions about\nmy inflated prose, holding his head in his hands.\nON THE SECOND DAY of January, the city of Fuling held a road race in\nthe center of town. It was the Twenty-second Annual Long Race to Welcome\nSpring, and all of the city’s schools and danwei, or work units, competed\nagainst each other. Two weeks before the race, Dean Fu asked if I would run\non the college team. He was obviously nervous, because it hadn’t been long\nsince the problems of the faculty basketball tournament.\n“You must understand,” he said, smiling uncomfortably. “There will be\nmany peasants and uneducated people. They don’t know anything about\nsportsmanship, and perhaps some of them will be rough. Also, in twenty-one\nyears they have never had a foreigner in the long race. They welcome you to\nparticipate, but I think it will be different from in America.”\nI could see that Dean Fu thought it would be simpler if I didn’t run, and I\nknew he was right. For a while I considered not taking part, because the\nbasketball tournament had been a low point in an otherwise good semester.\nAll of the difficult parts of my life were already public; there wasn’t any\nreason to seek out more crowds.\nBut there are no referees in running, and it is not a contact sport. There\nwould be crowds but I figured that at least I would be moving. It couldn’t be\nmuch different from a race in America—and even if it was, I was curious to\nsee what it was like, at least once. I told Dean Fu that I wanted to participate.",
        "He explained that every runner had to have a physical exam, and a week\nbefore the race I visited a doctor in the college infirmary. It was a low tile-\nroofed building next to the croquet court, one of the old structures on campus\nthat remained from the pre-Cultural Revolution days when the college had\nbeen a high school.\nThe doctor checked my pulse and blood pressure. After each test he\nsmiled and told me that I was very healthy, and I thanked him. Then he led\nme to a side room where a dirty white box-shaped instrument hung on the\nwall. Dean Fu said, “Now you will have a chest X ray.”\nI stopped at the entrance to the room. “I don’t want to have a chest X\nray,” I said.\n“It’s no problem,” said Dean Fu, smiling. “It’s very safe.”\n“I don’t want a chest X ray,” I said again, and I looked at the dirty box\nand thought: Especially I don’t want this chest X ray. “Why is it necessary?”\n“Everybody in the race must have one. To make sure they are healthy.”\n“Everybody?” I asked, and he nodded. I asked how many people would\nbe running.\n“More than two thousand and five hundred.”\n“And all of them must have a chest X ray before they can run?”\n“Yes,” he said. “That is the rule. It is very safe.”\nIt struck me as a ludicrous notion—that a city with a per capita income of\nabout forty American dollars a month would require a chest X ray from each\nof the 2,500 participants in a four-kilometer road race. I had my suspicions\nabout what was really happening: some administrator in the college was\nprobably worried about me dropping dead in the middle of the race, and they\nwanted to cover their tracks. It was always Dean Fu’s job to convey such\ncommands to the waiguoren, and occasionally he served as a filter as much\nas a translator. It was a lousy job and I always felt sorry for him when I\nsensed that this was happening, but there was nothing to do about it except\ntry to find a tactful solution.\nWe were at an impasse. Dean Fu could see that I was serious about\nrefusing to have an X ray, and I knew that he couldn’t simply back down and\nsay that the procedure wasn’t in fact required. We stood there for a moment,\nthe doctor watching expectantly. Finally I told Dean Fu that I would go to my\napartment and call the Peace Corps office in Chengdu.\nI tried to call but the medical officer wasn’t in. I sat in my bedroom for",
        "ten minutes, reading a book, and then I returned to the infirmary.\n“I’m very sorry,” I said, “but the Peace Corps told me I can’t have a chest\nX ray. I don’t know what we can do about this.”\n“It’s no problem,” Dean Fu said. “I just talked to some of the people in\ncharge of the race, and they said it is fine if you do not have an X ray. They\nwill give you an exception because you are a foreigner.”\nI thanked him and apologized for the hassle, and he apologized back.\nBoth of us shook the doctor’s hand. He walked us to the door, smiling and\nwaving as we left.\nTHERE WAS NO SCHEDULED TIME for the race to start. The runners\nassembled in a disorderly mob at the starting area, and at nine o’clock the\ncadres began their speeches. The race would begin whenever the speeches\nfinished, and the officials droned on and on while the starting line repeatedly\nbroke and surged. A small section would make a false start and the rest of the\ncrowd would react, and then the police would call everybody back. I tried to\njog in place to stay warm, fighting with my elbows to keep position.\nThe starting line was spread across a massive construction site where a\nnew public park was being built. The entire left side of the line headed\ndirectly toward a six-foot drop—a small, crumbling cliff. On the far right was\na narrow dirt road that provided the only safe exit for the runners, but it was\nso close to the start—less than forty yards—that it would be impossible for\nthe crowd to funnel in such a short distance. And even for the runners who\ndid make it safely, the course immediately took a ninety-degree turn that\nwould claim more victims.\nWithout question it was the most dangerous starting arrangement I had\never seen in a lifetime of racing. I was tempted to pull out, partly for my\nsafety but mostly because I wanted to be able to watch the disaster from the\nperspective of a spectator. Rob Schmitz, another Peace Corps volunteer, was\nvisiting us that week, and he and Adam took their cameras and gleefully\nwaited across the road.\nThe college team had staked out a spot on the right side of the line,\ndirectly in front of the exit. Most of them were physical education students,\nand usually we were the best team in the race, along with the Taiji medicine",
        "factory. All of us squeezed together, waiting for the start. It was a cool\nmorning and the winter smog hung low over the city.\nFive minutes passed, then ten. The cadres kept talking, and the police\nwere having trouble holding everybody back. Either they were going to start\nthe race or it was going to start itself, and finally one of the cadres must have\nrealized this. He fired the gun.\nIt was China. Chaos, noise, adrenaline; fear and surprise and excitement;\na mass of bodies, everybody yelling, horns sounding, the earth pounding; all\nof us running madly, arms outstretched to clear room; legs pumping, dashing,\nsprinting, trying to keep the back kick low to avoid being tripped; some\nrunners shouting as they stumbled over the cliff, others skidding around the\nfirst turn, dodging the few unfortunate ones who fell and skidded below the\nrush of legs. The seconds slid past, each moment an eternity of concentration\nand effort. We flew down the street in a wild charging mob, hit the second\nturn, and headed west on Xinghua Road.\nThe course began to climb uphill. The scene was still shaky with\nadrenaline but I realized that the eternity of the start was over, and that I was\nno longer a part of the starting mob. After the beginning of a race there is\nalways that moment of disengagement, when the euphoria of being a part of\nsomething massive is over and you realize that you are alone, and that you\nhave your own race to run.\nI slowed down. Suddenly I felt tired; the adrenaline evaporated and\neverything slipped into focus. I checked myself—no scrapes, no bruises; no\nmemory of exactly how I had made it safely off the line. I glanced around\nme. I was in the lead pack, a group of perhaps fifty, and the others were also\nsettling in after the rush of the start. We were climbing steadily now and the\npace was slowing. I felt my legs come back to me, the numb excitement\nreplaced by the rhythm of a long hard run—steady steady steady steady, up\non my toes as the hill steepened. Police cars rolled their lights in front of the\npack. Far ahead, groups of school kids were trying to cheat, jumping into the\nrace with a lead of a hundred yards, but the cops pulled them out as they\ndrove past.\nThe entire first half was uphill, and by the time I took the lead, perhaps\ntwo minutes into the race, I could see that the others were finished. It was a\nvaried field—college students and danwei workers and a few athletes who\nclearly could have been good runners with more training—but all of them",
        "were done. Quickly I slipped ahead.\nTo lead any big race is a strange feeling. People speak of the loneliness of\nrunning, but I’ve always felt that the sport is lonely only in the races, and\nespecially when the pack breaks and you find yourself alone in front. In the\npack you usually feel some solidarity with the other athletes, even though you\nare still competing, but in front there are no illusions. That’s when the race\nbecomes a chase—one man against the rest of the field—and I’ve always felt\nthat this is the loneliest feeling in the world. And it’s even lonelier when you\nare the only foreigner in a field of more than two thousand, and all along the\ncourse spectators are calling out “Waiguoren, waiguoren, waiguoren.” Out-\nof-country person, out-of-country person, out-of-country person.\nI looked back. Behind me I could see the rest of the field—an endless\nstream of people, a black-haired mob. The main pace car had slowed and I\nwas following a few strides behind its flashing lights. I looked back again, so\nI would remember the strangeness of the scene. The hill was steep now,\nclimbing toward the pointed tower of the Monument to the Revolutionary\nMartyrs. The street was lined with spectators and I could hear the wave of\nsurprise as I passed; they were talking excitedly and exclaiming with\namazement. “Waiguoren, waiguoren, waiguoren.”\nAnd I thought: Not today. If you’re looking for people who are out of\ntheir country, out of place, out of step, out of shape, awkward, clumsy; if\nthat’s what you’re looking for, look back there. Look for the ones who started\ntoo fast, or the men who have smoked too many Magnificent Sound\ncigarettes, or the people who are wearing too many clothes and are choking\nwith heat and sweat. Don’t look at me—I’ve done this for many years in\nmany places, and always it has been exactly the same. There are no referees,\nno language barriers, no complicated rules of etiquette. All you do is run.\nBy the turnaround I had more than thirty seconds on the next runner, and\nI took it easy from there. The second half was all downhill, and because it\nwas an out-and-back course I passed the rest of the field. The ones who\nweren’t too exhausted joined in the chorus: “Waiguoren, waiguoren,\nwaiguoren.” But it didn’t bother me a bit, because for those four kilometers I\nfelt completely at home.",
        "FOR THE VICTORY I won two pairs of polyester sports uniforms, both\ntoo small, with the characters for Fuling City inscribed proudly on the chest. I\nalso received a certificate testifying that “Comrade He Wei,” my Chinese\nname, had won the Twenty-second Annual Long Race to Welcome Spring.\nThe race organizers awarded me twenty yuan, and the college gave me five\nfor participating on its team. They also gave me one and a half yuan for\nundergoing the medical exam, which made me wonder how much I could\nhave made if I had agreed to the chest X ray. All told I cleared twenty-six and\na half yuan, which paid for two weeks of noodle lunches.\nI was on the local TV news for the following week, and the next day’s\npaper featured a front-page story about the race. They reported that an\nAmerican teacher from Missouri named H.Essler had participated, and there\nwas a detailed description of the way I had warmed up before the start. They\nreported the excitement of the college representatives when I finished in first\nplace, and they quoted one of the other top finishers, a young man from the\nmedicine factory who said, “If this race had been right after my military\ntraining, I definitely would have beaten that foreigner.” The end of the article\nread:\nThe competition also succeeded in establishing patriotism in sports.\nWhen our reporter asked, “What are your thoughts about a waiguoren\nfinishing first,” a Trade School student named Xu Chengbo said: “To\nhave a sports competition in a Chinese area and allow a waiguoren to\ntake first place, I feel very ashamed. This gives us a wakeup call: our\nstudents and adults need to improve the quality of their bodies, because\nif we improve our strength, we can be victorious!”…A Southwest\nMilitary School teacher said: “The waiguoren took the initiative, and\nthat sort of spirit deserves to be studied. Only if we plunge into\ndeveloping our bodies, and have more diligent and scientific training,\nwill we see the day when we achieve the championship!”\nIt wasn’t exactly the reaction I had hoped for, although I wasn’t\nsurprised. There was a great deal of patriotism in Fuling, and sports always\nmade these feelings particularly intense. That was why the basketball had",
        "been such a failure, and sometimes I wondered if it had been a bad idea to run\nin the race. A few of my Peace Corps friends thought that at least I shouldn’t\nhave tried to win. But I liked running races hard, just like many others in the\ncompetition, and I saw no reason to treat the people in Fuling like children. I\nwanted them to know that waiguoren were living in their city, and I wanted\nthem to see that despite all my struggles with the language, there was at least\none thing I could do well. If they reacted with shame, that was unfortunate,\nbut perhaps when they grew to know me better it would be different. I figured\nit was a good sign that my certificate read “Comrade He Wei.”\nA few days after the race, I had class with Teacher Liao, who beamed\nwhen we started the lesson.\n“I saw on the department message board that you won the long race in\nFuling!” she said. “I hadn’t heard—why didn’t you tell me?”\n“It’s not important,” I said. “In fact, I didn’t run very fast at all.”\n“Yes, you did!” she said, doubly pleased by my false modesty, which\nfollowed the appropriate Chinese custom. “That’s a very big race—in all of\nFuling City, you are the fastest person!”\n“There are probably better athletes who didn’t participate,” I said. “And\nyou know, Wang Junxia is still faster than me.”\nWang Junxia was the Chinese woman distance runner who had recently\nwon gold and silver medals in the Atlanta Olympics, and this reference made\nTeacher Liao even happier. She praised me again, and finally we settled\ndown to a chapter on how to say goodbye. Either I did unusually well or she\nwas in a particularly forgiving mood; on that day she hardly said budui at all.",
        "THE WHITE CRANE RIDGE\nTODAY THE YANGTZE RIVER is two inches higher than it was in\nmidwinter 1,234 years ago. The intervening years have witnessed other\nchanges—the passing of five imperial dynasties; the arrival and departure of\nthe Mongols, the Manchus, the British, the Japanese; the construction of the\nGreat Wall and the destruction of the Cultural Revolution; the Great Leap\nForward and the Reform and Opening; the development of the Three Gorges\nDam from a half-formed dream to the biggest building project in China—but\ndespite all of these changes the level of today’s Yangtze is exactly two inches\nhigher than it was in 763. Two inches in 1,234 years.\nThis is the story that is told by the White Crane Ridge, an eighty-yard-\nlong strip of sandstone that sits like a temporary island in Fuling’s harbor. At\nmost the ridge emerges from below the muddy skin of the Yangtze for five\nwinter months, in the heart of the dry season, and the ridge does not appear at\nall if the year is unusually wet. When it does emerge, the sandstone speaks—\ntwenty-two pictures and over 300,000 characters are engraved on its surface.\nAlong the nearly four thousand miles of the Yangtze’s length, there is no\nother place where man has left such a vivid record of the river’s life.\nNobody knows for certain when the ridge was first used in this way, but\nvirtually all of the carvings refer to a pair of stone carp that are engraved at\nthe bobbing waterline of the river. Each fish is nearly two feet long and they\nswim one after the other, heading westward, their bellies forming a line that\nrepresented the low-water mark at the time of their engraving. In the hooked\nmouth of the forward carp is a lotus blossom. These fish were carved\nsometime in the Tang Dynasty before the year 763, which is the date of the\nfirst engraved reference to their appearance. This afternoon, the level of the\nYangtze is just a touch higher than the line of the carp.\nThe original purpose of the fish was practical rather than artistic. Never\nwas the Yangtze more dangerous to boats than in winter, when low water",
        "exposed shoals and crags. Pilots passing Fuling could study the White Crane\nRidge, note the water level in comparison to the twin carp, and predict the\ncondition of the river ahead. The fish swam in place; the river constantly\nfluctuated; the locals understood this relationship and it became part of the\nYangtze’s annual pattern.\nOver the years, other dynasties left their own engravings on the ridge,\nmost of which note the return of the Tang fish. Just above the two carp, a\nNorthern Song Dynasty carving greets their appearance in the year 971: “The\nwater of the river retreats. The stone fish are seen. Next year there will be a\nbumper harvest.” Ten feet higher on the ridge, time suddenly leaps three and\na half centuries to 1333, when Yuan Dynasty officials note the Tang carp’s\nreturn: “In Fuling the appearance of the stone fish indicates a great harvest,\nguarding the prefecture for the next year.”\nMost of the carvings follow this ritualized form—the date of the carp’s\nsighting, followed by a harvest prediction, all of which is inscribed in the\nname of the emperor. Central to this ritual was the belief that the appearance\nof these Tang fish was associated with harvests, and eventually the White\nCrane Ridge shifted from a navigational tool into an oracle of the mysterious\nand vital cycles of the natural world. And pinned through these never-ending\ncycles was the straight line of human history, as the representatives of\nemperor after emperor left their marks on the rock.\nThe ridge was only one of dozens of annual signs that were recorded in\nthis way by the emperor. He was the Son of Heaven, a representative of the\nunspeakable forces of nature, and yet the manifestation of these same forces\n—an earthquake, a flood, a famine—could signal that heaven had turned\nagainst a ruler and his dynasty. The emperor embodied what he could not\ncontrol and did not understand. As a result, he sought refuge in ritual, and the\nFuling government officials regularly engraved the stone in the name of their\nruler, despite the broken and weathered paragraphs of old that testified to lost\ndynasties and forgotten emperors. And the springtime rising of the Yangtze,\nthe swollen river sweeping over the characters, gave evidence that there were\nforces the emperor could only watch, and that his glorious titles, like the\ninscriptions, were nothing more than words.\nAnd so it goes with the Yuan. The 1333 inscription speaks optimistically\nof a bumper harvest, but the dynasty is already on the decline, having slipped\nfrom what was the largest empire the world has ever known—the empire of",
        "Kublai Khan, the Mongol-ruled China that Marco Polo visited. But by 1333,\nMarco Polo is long gone, and Kublai Khan is dead, and the power of the\nYuan is fading. Their officials carve bravely onto the stone, but the dynasty\nhas only thirty-five more years before the wash of time covers it forever.\nDOCKED ON THE SOUTH SIDE of the White Crane Ridge are three\nsampans. The boats are wood, with arched roofs of bamboo and woven reeds.\nEach roof is less than three feet tall at the highest point, reducing wind drag\nand avoiding a structure that could tip the craft, which has no keel. The boats\nare light and narrow, low-gunneled, with virtually no freeboard, and they are\neasily maneuvered in the river’s current. Their design has not changed greatly\nsince people first began carving on the rock to which the sampans are\ntethered.\nFour women chat in the prow of a boat. All of them wear simple jackets\nof blue, and their clothes, like the boats, are dirty. They are river people who\nlive on their sampans; for most of the year they depend on fishing, but winter\nfish are sluggish and the owners of these crafts spend the season on the ridge.\nThey rely on tourism, using small rowboats to ferry visitors back and forth\nfrom shore.\nToday is a holiday and more than fifty visitors are wandering up and\ndown the sandstone, gazing at the inscriptions. Occasionally they will ask a\nquestion of one of the eight workers stationed on the ridge, who have been\nsent here by the Fuling City Cultural Relics Administration. Two of these\nstaff members have some formal education in archaeology, while the others\nare common workers whose job is to sell snacks, oversee the rowboats, and,\nfor two yuan, take photographs of visitors next to the ridge’s biggest carved\nfish.\nA cold wind runs down the corridor of the river valley, and the workers\nhuddle around their snack table, shivering and drinking hot tea. They watch\nthe Yangtze closely, measuring its level every day. Undoubtedly they dream\nof the river rising, because whenever it covers the carvings they can return to\nthe indoors work of their government office in town. For them, the\nappearance of the stone carp augurs nothing more than long cold days of\nexile out on the river.",
        "To a certain degree this is appropriate, because a number of inscriptions\nwere made by government officials who for various infractions had been\nexiled to Fuling. It was the sort of place that made for a good punishment—a\nlonely river town far from the heart of the empire, a post where\ncommunications broke down and the civilized world slipped away. One\ncarving was mistakenly made in the name of an emperor who had actually\nalready died. News of his passing had not yet made its way down the\nYangtze, and so local officials didn’t realize that they were the subjects of a\nnew ruler.\nAnd while Fuling sometimes represented the end of a political career, the\nridge is testimony that other pursuits could flourish here. Poetry and\ncalligraphy were the traditional pastimes of the lonely exile, and many of the\nlocal officials left inscriptions that are works of beauty. Toward the western\nedge, four characters are inscribed with particular style: “The River Runs\nForever.” This carving’s exact date is unknown; it was made sometime\nduring the Kuomintang period, in the 1930s or 1940s, and the calligraphy’s\ndistinctive loops and curves are of the “running grass” script style. The last\ncharacter, nian, trails off in a long straight line that points like a dagger at the\nriver below.\nPerhaps the ridge’s most famous calligraphy consists of four large\ncharacters less than twenty feet from the Tang carp. These words are stacked\none on top of the other, and they follow the flowing form of the “running\nhand” style. Moss grows green in the ruts of the inscription, which says,\n“Pillar Rock in Midstream.”\nThe author, Xie Bin, was a celebrated calligrapher in the Fuling area,\nwhere his skills earned him the nickname Sacred Hand. He carved the phrase\nin 1881, during the Qing Dynasty, and the elegant inscription calls to mind\nthat period more than a century ago, when the pillar rock holds steady but\nChina is in trouble. The Opium Wars have been fought and lost; the Great\nTaiping Rebellion has been put down at enormous expense. European powers\ncontrol ports all along the Chinese coast. Government money to modernize\nthe navy is being diverted to build a new pleasure palace for Cixi, the\nEmpress Dowager. Thirteen years from now, the Japanese will invade Korea,\ntaking both the peninsula and southern Manchuria. But the White Crane\nRidge emerges as it always has, and Fuling’s Sacred Hand leaves his graceful\nmark.",
        "A Russian-made hydrofoil streaks past the north side of the rock, heading\ntoward Chongqing. The boat’s wake rises and swamps the lower section of\nthe ridge. Tourists scamper to higher ground, laughing, and the water breaks\nwhite over the characters and engraved fish. Then the waves subside, and the\ncarvings are clear once more, and the river runs the same way it has run\nforever.",
        "CHAPTER FOUR",
        "The Dam\nI TAUGHT MY WRITING CLASS from a Chinese-published text called A\nHandbook of Writing. Like all of the books we used, its political intent was\nnever understated, and the chapter on “Argumentation” featured a model\nessay entitled “The Three Gorges Project Is Beneficial.”\nIt was a standard five-paragraph essay and the opening section explained\nsome of the risks that had led people to oppose the project: flooded scenery\nand cultural relics, endangered species that might be pushed to extinction, the\nthreat of earthquake, landslide, or war destroying a dam that would hold back\na lake four hundred miles long. “In short,” the second paragraph concluded,\n“the risks of the project may be too great for it to be beneficial.”\nThe next two sentences provided the transition. “Their worries and\nwarnings are well justified,” the essay continued. “But we should not give up\neating for fear of choking.” And the writer went on to describe the benefits—\nmore electricity, improved transportation, better flood control—and\nconcluded by asserting that the Three Gorges Project had more advantages\nthan disadvantages.\nI had some moral qualms about teaching a model persuasive essay whose\ntopic had been banned from public debate in China since 1987—this seemed\na slap in the face to the very notion of argumentation. At worst it was an\nexercise in propaganda, and at best it didn’t seem particularly sporting. But I\nhad nothing else to work with, and the truth was that the essay, apart from its\npolitical agenda, provided a good structural model. My job was to teach the\nstudents how to write such a composition, and so I went ahead and taught it. I\nreckoned there was no sense in giving up eating for fear of choking.\nI was punished by having that transition sentence infect my students’\npapers for the rest of the term. They were accustomed to learning by rote,\nwhich meant that they often followed models to the point of plagiarism. They\nwere also inveterate copiers; it wasn’t uncommon to receive the exact same",
        "paper from two or three students. There wasn’t really a sense of wrong\nassociated with these acts—all through school they had been taught to imitate\nmodels, and copy things, and accept what they were told without question,\nand often that was what they did.\nWhen I told them that the Three Gorges essay was a good model, they\nlistened carefully and adopted its nuances in future work. I assigned\nargumentative essays on whether students should be required to do morning\nexercises, and many of them opened their compositions by describing the\nbenefits of the morning routine. After that was finished, they made their shift:\n“But we should not give up eating for fear of choking.” Even students who\nwere writing on opposite sides of the issue used that same transition. Later I\nassigned an argumentative essay on Hamlet’s character, and they listed his\nshortcomings—indecisiveness, cruelty to Ophelia—and many of them\nseemed like good papers until suddenly that cursed sentence came from\nnowhere and boomed out, “But we should not give up eating for fear of\nchoking.” I came to loathe the phrase, and repeatedly I told them that it was a\nhorrid transition, but it always reappeared. At last I gave up, consoling myself\nby thinking darkly of the day when the river was dammed, and the Yangtze\nwould rise up and carry away all of the Handbooks of Writing and smash\nthem in the dam’s seven-hundred-megawatt turbines.\nThat was only fancy, of course—the new reservoir would cause the river\nto rise, but it wouldn’t climb as high as the teaching building. Some of my\nstudents said it would hardly reach the middle of the East River district, while\nothers said it would flood the entire neighborhood, rising all the way to the\ncollege’s front gates. None of them knew for certain, but they didn’t seem to\ncare. They had been told that the dam was beneficial, and that was enough.\nIN TOWN I KNEW EXACTLY where the waterline of the new Yangtze\nwould be, because there were signs that marked its future rise. One was in the\nold part of Fuling, painted in red on the side of a snack shop. There was\nanother in downtown’s Mid-Mountain Road, which was the second big street\nabove the docks.\nBoth of these signs said the same thing in huge red numbers: “177m.”\nThis figure represented the future water level of the reservoir, which at its",
        "maximum could be filled to an elevation of 177 meters (581 feet) above sea\nlevel. There were red signs like this in all of the Yangtze settlements, and\nheading downstream the numbers marched steadily up the hillsides, until at\nlast you came to low-lying towns like Wushan, where the signs were so far\nabove the city that nothing would be left once the dam reached full capacity\nin 2009.\nBecause Fuling lies three hundred miles upstream from the dam site, the\nrise of the river here won’t be nearly as dramatic as in places like Wushan.\nBut even in Fuling the red numbers foreshadow what will be a massive\nchange: taking the White Crane Ridge as Fuling’s traditional winter\nbenchmark, the surface of the new reservoir will be more than 130 feet above\nthe Tang Dynasty twin carp.\nSometimes when I was in town I’d stop and watch the 177m signs for a\nfew minutes on an average morning. Outside the snack shop, children would\nbe playing, and stick-stick soldiers would be carrying loads up the steps, and\nthe woman who owned the shop would have a yellow pot of bean curd\nsteaming in her doorway. On Mid-Mountain Road there would be\nunemployed laborers standing with bow saws and paintbrushes, looking for\nwork, and shoeshine men and small-time entrepreneurs would have their\nstands set up next to the sign. Everywhere I looked, it was typical, everyday\nlife; and yet in a decade all of it would be below the level of the new\nreservoir. And by walking downhill I could see just how much more of the\ncity would be affected: the majority of the old town with its buildings of tile\nand wood, and the entire shop district of Mid-Mountain Road and Riverside\nRoad. They were lively parts of the city, and the people always seemed too\nbusy to look twice at those signs. The river wasn’t scheduled to start rising\nuntil 2003, which for the residents of Fuling was a long time away. They had\nother things to worry about.\nThey also had the government’s promise that it would build a dike around\nFuling to protect these low-lying districts. Whenever I asked people about the\nThree Gorges Project, they always shrugged and said that the city was going\nto build a 150-foot-high shuiba, a water-wall, which meant that the new dam\nwouldn’t affect their homes. But the details of this dike seemed awfully\nvague. Would it surround the entire city? When would it be built? If they\nbuilt a 150-foot high wall next to your home, wouldn’t that be awfully dark\nand unpleasant? And what about safety—could you really trust the shuiba?",
        "Whenever I asked these questions, nobody had any answers, and it seemed\nthat none of them entertained such doubts. There was going to be a shuiba—\nthat was all they knew and all that mattered. Even when I left Fuling, in the\nsummer of 1998, construction of the dike hadn’t yet begun, but still I didn’t\nhear of any worries or concerns.\nMostly I heard the advantages of the dam, which followed the three\npoints of my textbook’s essay: electricity, flood control, and transportation.\nThese are important issues for people in a place like Fuling, and with regard\nto all three the new dam will make a substantial difference. By far it will be\nthe largest hydroelectric dam in the world, its wall roughly six times the\nlength of the Hoover Dam’s, and the Three Gorges Dam’s twenty-six\nmassive turbines will produce 18,100 megawatts of electricity—the\nequivalent of ten nuclear reactors, enough energy to boost China’s national\noutput by 10 percent. The Yangtze’s summer floods, which in the past six\ndecades have killed more than 330,000 people, will be better controlled by\nthe dam. In effect, it will turn Chongqing into a seaport, as ten-thousand-ton\nships—three times the size of the current limit—will be able to navigate the\nupper river.\nThis last point was of particular interest to Fuling, because the largest\nships will not be able to go all the way to Chongqing in all seasons. There are\nsome narrow river passages between the two cities, and speculation is that\nFuling will become a major port to serve boats too large to reach Chongqing.\nThis will be a significant change, as Fuling, with its lightly populated Wu\nRiver, has previously played a relatively small role in Sichuan’s\ntransportation network. More important, this new status will end the city’s\nisolation. When I arrived in Fuling, construction had already begun on a\nhigh-speed expressway that would run to Chongqing, and there was talk of\nbuilding a railroad sometime after the year 2000. For the people of Fuling\nthese were long-awaited changes; soon their city would become something\nmore than a forgotten river town, and they would no longer be at the mercy\nof the Yangtze and its slow boats.\nBut at the same time this begged another obvious question: Can one\nreally believe that all of the people along the Yangtze—the boat captains, the\nbusinessmen, the flood-fearing peasants—will no longer be at the mercy of\nthe river? Or will the river still be in control, with the stakes of disaster raised\nby the effort to harness the Yangtze? The dam is being constructed on an",
        "earthquake fault, and the unstable Gorges have a long history of enormous\nlandslides that cause massive waves. And the Yangtze isn’t just water; the\nriver carries a thousand times as much silt as the muddy Mississippi. Cities\nlike Chongqing and Fuling spew their sewage more or less untreated into the\nriver, as well as waste from their factories, and there is speculation that all of\nthis filth and silt will back up behind the dam. A ten-thousand-ton ship won’t\nbe of much use in a four-hundred-mile-long bog.\nFor these and other reasons, the project has long inspired apocalyptic\nvisions from a host of experts, both Chinese and foreign. They envision a\nbroken dam, a silt-filled reservoir; they warn that the rising river will carry\nnew poisons that previously had been stored on its banks. The reservoir will\nflood thirteen cities, 140 towns, and 1,352 villages; it will swamp 650\nfactories and 139 power stations. For more than ten thousand years the river\nvalley has been home to human civilization, and all of man’s endless traces,\nthe garbage dumps and the chemical deposits, will be held stagnant in the\nnew reservoir. And the river isn’t something to be tinkered with lightly—over\n350 million people live in the Yangtze’s watershed, more than in America\nand Canada combined, one person out of every twelve on earth.\nExperts warn that mercury, lead, and other poisons from the flooded areas\ncould be carried into people’s water supplies, and they fear the outbreak of\nendemic infections along the soggy new valley: malaria, leptospirosis,\nJapanese B encephalitis. The dam’s forty thousand construction workers, all\nof whom are living temporary lives in temporary housing, will spread\ngonorrhea via the prostitutes who flock to the workers’ cities. AIDS could\nrun the same course. And where will these workers go when the dam is\nfinished?\nAnd what about the nearly two million people, mostly peasants, who will\nbe displaced by the new reservoir? The government has promised them\nbenefits of jobs and land, which will cost one-third of the entire project’s\nprice tag—thirty billion dollars, according to conservative estimates. But\neastern Sichuan has long been an isolated part of the country, and local\nofficials have little direct contact with the central government. Sending huge\nsums of money down the river is far more likely to lead to corruption rather\nthan efficient population transfer.\nThere are countless tombs, dozens of ancient temples, and many priceless\ncultural relics like the White Crane Ridge. What will be done with those? The",
        "ridge would be a major historical monument in most parts of the world, but\nthere is so much history in the Three Gorges region that Fuling’s carvings\ndon’t even make the A-list of threatened artifacts. Downstream is Shibaozhai,\na stunning twelve-story pagoda from the eighteenth century, and beyond that\nis Yunyang’s seventeen-hundred-year-old temple to Zhang Fei, a hero from\nthe Three Kingdoms era. Both will be lost if expensive preservation measures\naren’t undertaken. And there are tombs of the Ba people, who lived in Fuling\nand the other Yangtze regions more than two thousand years ago, and whose\nremains have never been thoroughly studied. Little is known about them, and\nnothing more will be learned after their relics are flooded forever.\nThe dam also threatens wildlife: the Siberian crane, the cloud leopard, the\nfinless porpoise, the Chinese alligator, the Chinese white river dolphin, the\nChinese sturgeon, and 172 other species of fish. Already the development of\nthe Yangtze, which carries 80 percent of China’s river traffic, has been\nenvironmentally costly, and there are but one hundred river dolphins left.\nThis is one of five freshwater dolphin species in the world, and for millennia\nit adapted to the muddy waters of the Yangtze until now it is virtually blind,\nrelying on highly developed sonar capabilities. But today the river is full of\nboats, with the racket of engines growing louder every year, and the dolphin,\ndeafened by technology and blinded by evolution, is already having trouble\navoiding danger and finding mates. Ten-thousand-ton ocean vessels might\nfinish off the species.\nThese points have been made throughout the decades that the dam has\nbeen considered by Chinese leaders. The project was first conceived by Sun\nYat-sen in 1919, and it was seriously considered by both Chiang Kai-shek\nand Mao Zedong. For the dictators it had a classic Chinese appeal, at once\npragmatic and grandiose—a way to modernize a poor country while rallying\nnational pride, a modern-day infrastructure project on the scale of the Great\nWall and the Grand Canal. Mao’s engineers completed a full-scale survey in\n1955, and they might have started construction if not for the distractions of\nthe Great Leap Forward and the Cultural Revolution.\nBut there were always voices of dissent. Even in the 1980s, as Deng\nXiaoping and Premier Li Peng moved closer to beginning actual work on the\ndam, it was one of the few major issues in China that could be debated\npublicly. Criticism was accepted, and there was no shortage of it; many\nexperts believed that constructing a series of smaller dams on the Yangtze",
        "and its tributaries would have many of the same benefits without the risks.\nThe debates continued until finally in 1987 the government tired of this\nversion of democracy and silenced it. If China’s leaders wanted the largest\ndam in the world, it would be built, regardless of the risks. None of the\ndifficulties mattered—the silt, the earthquakes, the lost relics, the extinct\nspecies, the displaced peasants. The experts could be ignored, just as they had\nbeen ignored so many times in the past: when Mao encouraged high birth\nrates in the 1950s and 1960s; when the Great Leap Forward was launched;\nwhen the Cultural Revolution began. Sometimes you need decision rather\nthan debate. There’s no sense in giving up eating for fear of choking.\nBUT STILL THE CRITICAL VOICES wouldn’t go away. Dai Qing, a\nChinese journalist who was one of the project’s most vocal opponents, spent\nten months in prison after publishing a 1989 book condemning the dam. In\n1992, Premier Li Peng pushed the National People’s Congress to take a final\nvote on the project, which was duly approved. This was no surprise—the\nNPC wasn’t much more than a rubberstamp assembly—but nevertheless\nthere were signs of strong opposition, as a third of the representatives either\nopposed the project or abstained from voting.\nChina’s first environmental lobby group was formed in response to the\ndam, and careful criticism continued even as work began in 1993. In August\nof 1996, the month I arrived in Fuling, a number of archaeologists and other\nprofessors publicly requested President Jiang Zemin to step up efforts to\npreserve the flood region’s cultural relics. Protection work had been\nscheduled to begin in 1996, but nothing had yet been done, and the\npetitioners asked that $230 million be spent on various necessary measures:\nexcavations, relocated temples, new museums. There were proposals to\nprotect the island pagoda of Shibaozhai with a dike, and there was a plan to\nmove Zhang Fei’s temple, piece by piece, to higher ground. Tianjin\nUniversity proposed building an underwater museum to house Fuling’s White\nCrane Ridge. Tourists would access the museum via a tunnel on shore, and\nthe roof of the building would rise above the new reservoir in a shape that\nrecalled the ancient strip of sandstone.\nAll of these plans and complaints greatly annoyed the forces that were",
        "pushing the dam forward. Wei Tingcheng, the seventy-year-old chief\nengineer who had spent virtually his entire professional life developing the\nproject, scoffed at the “palaces” that archaeologists were proposing. “To tell\nyou the truth,” he said, in a 1996 interview with the New York Times, “the\ncommon people of China have such a low education level that they will not\nbe able to enjoy these cultural relics, and only some of these experts will go\nto these museums.”\nIt wasn’t a particularly tactful remark, but in some ways it addressed an\nimportant issue: a country like China is accustomed to making difficult\nchoices that Americans might not dream of considering. I thought of this\nevery time I visited the White Crane Ridge, where I was always amazed to\nsee the conjunction of the ancient carvings and the timeless river. Nowhere\nelse had I felt so strongly that there are two types of history, natures and\nman’s, and that one is a creature of cycles while the other, with mixed results,\naims always at straightness—progress, development, control. And I sensed\nthat on the Yangtze it was a particularly dangerous violation to force these\ntogether, pressing the river’s cycles into stagnancy behind the long line of the\ndam.\nBut this was a poetic turn of thought, and most people in Fuling couldn’t\nafford it. They didn’t have the time or interest to visit the White Crane Ridge,\nand they didn’t worry much about the relationship between man and nature.\nOften there were no other tourists on the ridge besides me, and the only time\nI ever saw a big crowd was the day I researched my story about the carvings,\nwhich was on a weekend during the Spring Festival holiday in 1998. Most\npeople in Fuling had difficulty reading the inscriptions—the characters were\nof the traditional sort that had been simplified after Liberation, and all of the\ncarvings followed the formal language that had been used by the Chinese\nintelligentsia before twentieth-century linguistic reforms. Even educated\npeople often weren’t interested. If you wanted to see local history, it wasn’t\nnecessary to go to the hassle of taking a boat—you could wander into the\ncountryside and stumble upon Qing Dynasty tombs without even searching.\nI was impressed that the city sent so many caretakers out to the ridge,\nespecially since many of these workers were well enough trained to answer\nalmost any question about the carvings’ content and history. This was far\nmore than I would have expected in a city with essentially no outside\ntourism, and at a historical site where often there weren’t any visitors at all. It",
        "wasn’t like America, where an empty and featureless late-Qing Dynasty\nbattlefield might receive millions of dollars in funding, simply because some\nsoldiers had fought and died there during a civil war. There was a great deal\nof history in China and if you protected all the ancient sites the people would\nhave nowhere to grow their crops.\nThe final government decision on the proposed underwater museum\nhadn’t yet been made, but approval seemed unlikely. The issue was\nsometimes covered in the Chongqing Evening Times, and this government-\nrun newspaper was always careful to note that officials were also considering\nanother option, which involved preserving the carvings by making a complete\nset of rubbings before the dam was built. To them, this would undoubtedly be\nthe more practical solution—the region simply didn’t have the sort of\nresources necessary to build an underwater exhibition chamber, and the\nWhite Crane Ridge didn’t mean much to the average Fuling resident. It\nseemed most likely that the rubbings would be made and sent off to a distant\nmuseum, and then the flood would cover the ridge forever. Experts estimated\nthat within ten years of the dam’s completion the silt and sand of the new\nreservoir would erase all twelve centuries’ worth of carvings.\nIt didn’t surprise me that protecting the ridge wasn’t high on the list of\nlocal priorities, but it was more striking that people in Fuling seemed just as\npassive about the dam’s other issues, including resettlement. Apart from the\ndowntown area, where the dike would be constructed, there were still large\nnumbers of people who would be displaced by the new reservoir: the\nresidents of lower East River, the peasants at the base of White Flat\nMountain, and the people who lived on the lower slopes of Raise the Flag\nMountain. They were called yimin—immigrants—and some of them would\nbe moved to the new apartments that were being constructed behind our\ncampus. This had originally been farmland, and the peasants whose fields had\nbeen taken for the construction project were compensated with discount\nprices on new apartments, as well as the choice between a government job\nand a cash settlement. The ones I spoke with had been offered six thousand\nyuan, and all of them had taken the cash—it was a lot of money in Fuling, a\nyear’s wages at a decent salary. They were also provided with a living\nstipend of seventy yuan a month, and as far as they were concerned it was a\nsweet package. After all, the last decade had seen plenty of Chinese leave the\ncountryside in search of city jobs, and it didn’t take a great deal of money to",
        "persuade a peasant not to be a peasant anymore. Every time I walked through\nthe half-built complex I saw shops full of ex-peasants, playing mah-jongg\nand smoking Magnificent Sound cigarettes, waiting patiently for the day\nwhen the flood would drive their new neighbors up from the river’s banks.\nThere were reports of immigrants who had not yet received their\ncompensations, often because of corrupt officials who embezzled funds,\nwhich seemed to be a particularly serious problem in downriver cities like\nWanxian. But even in these instances the most common reaction seemed to\nbe one of quiet complaint rather than open protest. The truth is that the\ndisruption of the dam, which seems massive to an outsider, is really nothing\nout of the ordinary when one considers recent history in the local context.\nWithin the last fifty years, China has experienced Liberation, the radical (and\ndisastrous) collectivization of the 1958–1961 Great Leap Forward, the\nCultural Revolution, and Reform and Opening.\nFuling and the other Yangtze River towns have the additional experience\nof being a focal point of Mao Zedong’s Third Line Project, which had an\nespecially large influence on the region during the 1960s. The early\npreparations for this project started in 1950, when Mao sent Deng Xiaoping\nto the southwest so he could research the feasibility of moving Shanghai’s\nmilitary industry to remote mountain areas in Sichuan and Guizhou\nprovinces. The American atomic bomb triggered this plan, as Mao became\nincreasingly concerned that China’s heavily concentrated defense industry\nwas too susceptible to a U.S. attack. The Korean War accelerated the project,\nand eventually three-quarters of China’s nuclear weapons plants were\nincorporated into the Third Line, as well as more than half of its aeronautics\nindustry. The project was, as Harrison Salisbury describes it in his book The\nNew Emperors, “something like that of picking up the whole of California’s\nhigh-tech industry and moving it bodily to the wilds of Montana as they\nexisted, say, in 1880.”\nIn comparison it seems a small matter to turn the river into a lake. Much\nof Fuling’s economy had originally come via the Third Line Project, which\nmade the locals accustomed to massive changes. The local Hailing factory,\nwhich now produces combustion engines for civilian use, had formerly been\na defense industry plant moved from Shanghai. A few miles upstream from\nFuling is the Chuan Dong boat factory, which in the old days made parts for\nnuclear submarines. All of the local Chang’an-brand cabs—the name means",
        "Eternal Peace—are made by a Chongqing factory that originally produced\nfirearms for the military.\nMany of the old Third Line factories had been converted in this way since\nDeng Xiaoping came to power and started dismantling the project in 1980.\nWith China’s foreign relations rapidly improving, the American threat\nseemed less serious (and, in any case, it was clear that there wasn’t much\nprotection in putting factories in places like Fuling). The Third Line had\nalways been a huge drain on the economy; in some years as much as 50\npercent of China’s capital budget was spent on the project. Never before had\nsuch a massive country reorganized its economy on such a scale—even\nStalin’s first Five-Year Plan couldn’t compare—and according to some\nestimates, the Third Line did more damage to China’s economy than the\nCultural Revolution.\nDespite its enormous scale, the project had been developed and\ndismantled in remarkable secrecy, as few locals in Fuling and the other Third\nLine towns ever had a clear notion of what was going on. They knew that\ncommands were coming in from Beijing, and that these commands were\nbringing factories from Shanghai; and they also knew that all of this had a\nmilitary sensitivity that required secrecy. It wasn’t something you asked\nquestions about, and after four decades of that it seemed natural enough not\nto ask questions about the dam. These things just came and went—just as the\nChuan Dong factory, which arrived to build nuclear submarines, was\nsubsequently converted to a boat plant, and eventually would disappear\nforever beneath the waters of the new Yangtze.\nBut even with all of this history in mind, I still found the lack of interest\nand concern about the dam to be remarkable. People were much better\neducated now than they had been in the past, and to some degree one would\nexpect China’s historical disasters to provide lessons that prevented their\nblind repetition. Nevertheless, it seemed clear that the dam and the fate of the\nlowland immigrants were not the concern of the average citizen. Once\nTeacher Kong and I talked about the dam during class, and I asked if the\ncoming changes worried him.\n“No,” he said, and I could see he thought it was a strange question.\n“Well, is anybody worried?”\nHe thought for a moment. “If you’re an immigrant,” he said, “then maybe\nyou’d be worried. But for most people it doesn’t make any difference.”",
        "The longer I lived in Fuling, the more I realized that this was a\ncharacteristic response. It was strange, because foreign newspapers routinely\nprinted scathing reports on the project, and there were angry critics in cities\nlike Beijing and Shanghai. But in Fuling, where the dam would affect the\npeople directly, there was no sign of unhappiness. In the two years I lived\nthere, I never heard a single resident complain about the Three Gorges\nProject, and I heard gripes about virtually every other sensitive subject.\nBut there wasn’t a strong sense of community in Fuling, as remarks like\nTeacher Kong’s illustrated. Recent history had taught the people to be\ndisengaged from public affairs, and this separation was compounded by a\nsimple lack of awareness. Fuling residents didn’t have access to reliable\ninformation about important local issues, which, combined with the\nrestrictions on public protest, made it difficult for citizens to be involved in\nany direct capacity. Most important, they neither expected nor demanded\ninformation of this sort.\nIn my opinion, this disengagement was so complete that it couldn’t be\nblamed simply on post-Liberation patterns. The past fifty years had taught the\npeople not to meddle in public affairs, but to some degree Communism\nmerely built on the foundations of traditional Chinese collectivism, which\nhad shaped social patterns for centuries. This characteristic can be difficult to\ndefine, especially with regard to its effects. My students often wrote about\nhow the Chinese were collective-minded, which inspired them to help each\nother through Socialism, while the individualistic Americans followed the\nselfish road of Capitalism.\nI didn’t agree that our countries’ political differences were so neatly (and\nmorally) explained by these contrasting attitudes toward the individual and\nthe group. But I felt that the stereotype was more accurate with regard to\nclose social networks of families and friends. The families I knew in Fuling\nwere arguably closer than the average in America, because individual\nmembers were less self-centered. They were remarkably generous with each\nother, and often this selflessness extended to good friends, who were also\ndrawn into tight social circles. Collective thought was particularly good for\nthe elderly, who were much better cared for than in America. In Fuling I\nnever saw older people abandoned in retirement homes; they almost always\nlived with their children, caring for grandchildren and doing what they could\nto help out around the family farm, business, or home. There was no question",
        "that their lives had more of a sense of purpose and routine than I had seen\namong the elderly at home.\nBut such collectivism was limited to small groups, to families and close\nfriends and danwei, or work units, and these tight social circles also acted as\nboundaries: they were exclusive as well as inclusive, and the average Fuling\nresident appeared to feel little identification with people outside of his well-\nknown groups. In daily life I saw countless examples of this sort of thought.\nThe most common was the hassle of ticket lines, which weren’t lines so much\nas piles, great pushing mobs in which every person fought forward with no\nconcern for anybody else. It was a good example of collective thought, but\nnot in the way my students said. Collectively the mobs had one single idea—\nthat tickets must be purchased—but nothing else held them together, and so\neach individual made every effort to fulfill his personal goal as quickly as\npossible.\nAnother striking example of this brand of collectivism involved the\nreaction to pickpockets on Fuling’s public buses. Once Adam was on a bus\nfrom East River and a shifty-looking passenger stepped off, and the person\nsitting next to Adam nudged his arm.\n“You should be careful,” he said. “That was a pickpocket.”\n“Why didn’t you tell me before he got off?” Adam asked, but there was\nno answer other than a shrug. I saw the same thing happen a number of times,\nwith people gesturing that I should watch my wallet, but never did they\nconfront the thief. When I asked my students about this, they said that\neverybody knew there were pickpockets who worked the buses, but nobody\ndid anything about it. According to my students, the people were afraid to\nresist, but it seemed there was more to it than that. As long as a pickpocket\ndid not affect you personally, or affect somebody in your family, it was not\nyour business. You might quietly alert the waiguoren, because he was a\nforeign guest, but even here you didn’t take any risks. Sometimes it was\nsafest to warn him after the pickpocket had already left the bus.\nThis same instinct led to the mobs that gathered around accident victims,\nstaring passively but doing nothing to help. Crowds often formed in Fuling,\nbut I rarely saw them act as a group motivated by any sort of moral sense. I\nhad witnessed that far more often in individualistic America, where people\nwanted a community that served the individual, and as a result they\nsometimes looked at a victim and thought: I can imagine what that feels like,",
        "and so I will help. Certainly there is rubbernecking in America as well, but it\nwas nothing compared to what I saw Fuling, where the average citizen\nseemed to react to a person in trouble by thinking: That is not my brother, or\nmy friend, or anybody I know, and it is interesting to watch him suffer. When\nthere were serious car accidents, people would rush over, shouting eagerly as\nthey ran, “Sile meiyou? Sile meiyou?”—Is anybody dead? Is anybody dead?\nIn the end, the divide between crowd and mob was extremely fragile in\nFuling. Something would happen—an accident, or, more likely, a public\nargument—and a crowd would appear, gathering its own momentum, swollen\nby people with one simple reason for being there: something was happening.\nAnd occasionally the sheer weight of a mass of people behind this single idea\nwas indeed enough to make something happen; an argument would escalate,\ndriven by the audience, or somebody from the crowd would start to\nparticipate and spur the action on.\nI was both disturbed and fascinated by Fuling crowds, partly because they\nso often gathered around me. If I stumbled upon an argument or any other\npublic event that had attracted a crowd, I invariably stopped to watch. But\nusually I watched the faces of the crowd rather than the actors themselves,\nand in their expressions it was hard to recognize anything other than that\nsingle eager observation: something was happening.\nFULING IS NOT THE ONLY PLACE IN CHINA where crowds have an\nedge, and countless writers, both Chinese and foreign, have remarked this\ntendency. Lu Xun, probably the greatest Chinese literary figure of the\ntwentieth century, wrote with intense feeling and frustration about the pre-\nCommunist tendency of the Chinese to ignore their fellow men in times of\nneed. I recognized this same frustration in the writing of my own students,\nespecially when they created stories about Robin Hood coming to China.\nMany of their tales featured Robin stealing from corrupt officials, but another\ncommon theme involved Robin acting in situations where the crowd was\npassive. One student wrote:\nOne day, haunting the street, he [Robin Hood] espied a pickpocketer\nreaching for money. At the same time he noticed that people around the",
        "woman saw the pickpocketer’s deed, but what disappointed him was that\nno one stood out and prevented the young man. They pretended to see\nnothing….\nI was struck by how many stories described scenes of this sort, and\nalways they continued with Robin coming to the aid of a person who was\nabandoned by the crowd—a victim of thieves, or somebody publicly beaten\nby bullies, or a person drowning in a river while the mob watched. To my\nstudents, this was the quintessential vision of true heroism, to act while the\ncrowd did nothing, and their holding it up as the ideal suggested that it rarely\nhappened in real life.\nI sensed that this was a small part of what contributed to the passivity\nwith regard to the Three Gorges Project in Fuling. The vast majority of the\npeople would not be directly affected by the coming changes, and so they\nweren’t concerned. Despite having large sections of the city scheduled to be\nflooded within the next decade, it wasn’t really a community issue, because\nthere wasn’t a community as one would generally define it. There were lots\nof small groups, and there was a great deal of patriotism, but like most\npatriotism anywhere in the world, this was spurred as much by fear and\nignorance as by any true sense of a connection to the Motherland. And you\ncould manipulate this fear and ignorance by telling people that the dam, even\nthough it might destroy the river and the town, was of great importance to\nChina.\nThe dam was an issue for the people who were unfortunate enough to live\nalong the banks, but even they weren’t likely to cause trouble. Like most\nChinese, they had been toughened by their history, and this was especially\ntrue in a remote place like Fuling. All of the big changes that had ever\ntouched the city came from somewhere else—the Taiping warriors had\nwandered in from the east, and the Kuomintang had come from Nanjing, and\nthe Communist land reforms had been initiated in the north before working\ntheir way south to the river valley. The Third Line Project had come and\ngone, sweeping everything in its wake. In recent years, fancy new products\nhad started making their way down the Yangtze from Chongqing, along with\nthe legal changes that allowed the new free-market economics. Even\nwaiguoren were now starting to appear on the streets of downtown Fuling.",
        "You accepted all of these developments and adjusted to them, because they\nweren’t under your control. It was like the Yangtze itself, which came from\nanother place and went somewhere else. Someday in the future it would rise\n130 feet, and you would cope with that as well. Once I asked a friend if there\nwould be any problems associated with the river’s future rise, and, like\nTeacher Kong, he seemed surprised at the question. “Well,” he said at last,\n“the boats will all float, so they’ll be fine.”\nThere was also a sense that the dam was simply a good idea. It meant\nelectricity, which represented progress, and this was the most important issue\nfor the vast majority of Fuling’s residents. The completed dam would\nsupposedly create enough electricity to replace the burning of fifty million\ntons of coal a year, which was no small benefit in a horribly polluted country\nwhere one of every four deaths was attributed to lung disease. There were\ndays when I stood on my balcony and felt a touch of sadness as I looked at\nthe Yangtze, because I knew its days as a rushing river were numbered. But\nthere were many other days when the smog was so thick that I couldn’t see\nthe river at all.\nI also gained new perspective on this issue during the winter, when there\nwere periodic power cuts to conserve electricity. My apartment had only\nelectric heating, and sometimes these blackouts lasted for hours—long, cold\nhours, the dark apartment growing steadily more uncomfortable until my\nbreath was white in the candlelight. I found that during these periods I didn’t\nthink too much about whether Fuling’s new dike would hold, or if the\nimmigrants would be well taken care of, or whether the White Crane Ridge\nwould be adequately protected. What I thought about was getting warm. Cold\nwas like hunger; it had a way of simplifying everything.\nAnd a lot of people in China still think in these terms. It’s different from\nAmerica, where there is an average of three thousand watts of electrical\npower for every citizen—enough for every single American to turn on an\noven and a hair dryer at once. In China, there are 150 watts per head, which is\nenough for everybody to switch on a light bulb or two. But even one light\nisn’t possible for the sixty million Chinese who have no electricity at all.\nThe history of such projects in China has two different aspects. The\ncountry has been controlling and harnessing water for centuries—no other\ncivilization on earth has such a long and successful history of turning rivers\nto man’s use. The development of central Sichuan province was originally",
        "sparked by the construction of Dujiangyan, a brilliantly designed irrigation\nproject that was constructed twenty-three centuries ago and even today still\nfunctions perfectly, turning the Chengdu Basin into one of the most fertile\nrice-growing regions in the country. Even the Yangtze has been tamed\nbefore, albeit on a much smaller scale; the Gezhou Dam was completed in\n1981 on a site downstream from the location of the current project.\nBut there is also the history of Henan province, where heavy rains in\n1975 caused sixty-two modern dams to fall like dominoes, one after another,\nand 230,000 people died. Although the scale of that particular disaster was\nunique, the poor engineering was less unusual: 3,200 Chinese dams have\nburst since 1949. In this century, the failure rate of Chinese dams is 3.7\npercent, compared to 0.6 percent in the rest of the world.\nIn the end I was like most people in Fuling—I passively watched the\npreparations for the project, and I tried not to be too judgmental. I was, after\nall, an outsider. But I figured it was better to be there before the dam than\nafterward, and it was good to see the White Crane Ridge and the Three\nGorges before the river was tamed. There was man’s history and there was\nthe Yangtze’s, and I didn’t particularly want to be there when they clashed,\nchanging the place forever.\nTHE SEMESTER FINISHED near the end of January, and we had four\nweeks off for the Spring Festival Holiday. Adam and I could go anywhere we\nwished—other volunteers were going to Japan, Thailand, Laos—but for us it\nwas easiest to go downstream, which was where we went.\nWe bought tickets on the afternoon Jiangyu boat because we had been\ntold not to. Our colleagues had warned us against those ships; they were dirty\nand crowded and served primarily as transportation for people who lived\nalong the river. They didn’t stop at the temples and interesting sights, like the\ntourist ships, and there wouldn’t be other waiguoren. All of that sounded\ngood—I had already seen enough temples, and the cliffs of the Gorges would\nlook the same from any boat. Mostly I was interested in catching a glimpse of\naverage life on the river.\nPreviously the Jiangyu line had been called “The East is Red,” in honor\nof the song praising Mao Zedong, but now there was a great deal of",
        "competition on the Yangtze and it was better not to remind potential\ncustomers of the sort of service they had received in the past. The boat we\ntook was named the Monkey King, taken from a character in the classic\nJourney to the West, which describes a seventh-century pilgrimage to India.\nThat had been during the Tang Dynasty, and the people along the Yangtze\nhad no bad memories associated with travel in those days.\nOur boat swung away from the docks on a beautiful afternoon, the sun\nshining bright on the White Crane Ridge. The Monkey King was everything\nwe had hoped for—pleasantly grimy, bustling with passengers, and there\nwere no waiguoren besides the four of us who were traveling together. In\naddition to Adam, there was another Peace Corps volunteer, Craig Simons,\nand a boyhood friend of mine named Mike Graham, who was teaching\nEnglish and studying Chinese in Xi’an. We settled on the back deck, standing\nin the sunshine and watching the river scenery.\nThe old familiar landscape slipped behind—White Flat Mountain\ndisappeared behind a bend, and Raise the Flag Mountain faded into the\ndistance. Strange new hills rolled eastward along the Yangtze. To me they\nwere nameless, without history, and every time we passed a pagoda-topped\nmountain or a riverside hamlet I wondered what had happened there. Had Shi\nDakai and his army passed through? Were there any echoes of the lost\ndynasties, any carved stones or ancient tombs? Had a sad-eyed calligrapher\nwith a steady hand ever been exiled to those shores? I was accustomed to\nbeing the one standing still; so often I had sat on my balcony, gazing down\non the ships and wondering where they were going; but now I was looking at\nthe land and thinking about what might have happened there. I realized that\nthis was how most passing tourists saw Fuling: a dirty harbor, a long sloping\nmountain, a wandering thought—did anything ever happen here?—and then\nthe river town was gone and new scenery came into view.\nThe sun glanced off the silver-brown water; hawks glided overhead. Men\nrode unsteady bamboo rafts along the river’s edge. Coal boats puttered past.\nWorkers quarried limestone along the shore, the clink of their chisels echoing\nclear above the winter river. We docked briefly at Fengdu, a long narrow city\nstretched across the river flats. Fengdu was low, too low; in a decade all of it\nwould be flooded. There was a pagoda on a hill just beyond town and that\nwas where the sun set, glowing orange for a moment and then disappearing\nbelow the green slope.",
        "A worker with a cigarette clenched between his teeth took down the\nChinese flag and put it in a box on the stern. Mike chatted with a former\nbiology student from Beijing, who explained that in 1989 he had taken part in\nthe student demonstrations; the subsequent crackdown had prevented him\nfrom pursuing an academic career. Instead he went into business with some\nfriends, producing fire alarms for boats, and this journey was both a business\ntrip and a victory tour. “Every boat on the Yangtze has our alarms,” he said\nproudly. There were still dissidents in prison for the political crimes of 1989,\nbut there was also a whole generation of young Chinese like this man, whose\npolitical record had pushed him to the relative freedom of business.\nThe hills were rising now, blue-green with the coming darkness, and\noften they were too steep for farming. On the north bank we passed a long\nwild hillside, empty except for two small white graves pressed close together.\nThey were completely alone and the fengshui was good; they faced south,\noverlooking the river, and perhaps they were high enough to foil the coming\nreservoir.\nThe boat cut its motor, coasting with the current. The air was still. Except\nfor us the river was empty; almost nobody was on deck. Everything was quiet\nas the heart of the Yangtze swept us onward. And in that moment I felt the\npower of the river, its massive silent strength pushing us downstream as night\ncrept over the valley.\nThe two lonely tombs slipped past in the twilight. The hills loomed black\nagainst the sky. Stars began to appear, faint and cold in the distance. And\nthen the motor rumbled to life once more, and darkness came, and I went to\nmy bunk in our third-class cabin.\nThere were ten beds and eleven people in our cabin; a young man and a\nwoman were sharing the bunk below Adam. On Chinese boats and trains it\nwas common for passengers to do that, because couples rarely paid for two\nseparate bunks, and often friends did the same to save money. Nobody would\nlook twice at two men lying together on a cramped berth.\nThe woman in our cabin was shy and she kept her eyes on the floor. She\nwas bundled in sweaters and her long black hair hung straight down her back.\nHer companion was also quiet; he asked politely where we were going, and\nthen he arranged their bunk and lay down to sleep.\nThe narrow beds had a thin bamboo matting and dirty old blankets. I slept\nrestlessly, waking while we docked at Wanxian and the city lights filtered",
        "into the cabin. After an hour the boat set off once more, and at last I fell\nasleep, lulled by the steady hum of the motor.\nI woke again in the unknown darkness of the river. I had been dreaming,\nand for an instant I was lost—was I at home in Missouri? Or Chengdu?\nFuling? I recognized the Yangtze sounds and remembered, and I was starting\nto fall back asleep when I heard the noise.\nA creak; a muffled gasp. Steady deep breathing and a sound that was soft\nand wet but not riverine. What was that? More creaks; the breathing deeper,\nless steady. I listened until I was fully awake, and then I realized what it was.\nThe couple on the bunk below Adam, the shy woman and the young man,\nwere having quiet but determined sex as the boat rocked its way toward the\nGorges.\nThey didn’t make much noise. The young Chinese were accustomed to\nthat—small rooms, crowded apartments, furtive moments in shady park\ncorners. Some of our students went in pairs down to the banks of the Wu\nRiver on Friday nights. On the boat I tried not to listen too closely, and\nfinally I fell asleep again. The next morning I would learn that Craig had also\nbeen awake, listening in disbelief, but Adam had slept soundly, oblivious to\nwhat was happening below him. And the next morning the woman again\nlooked shyly at the floor, brushing her hair away from her face as she\nprepared to disembark at Wushan.\nWE SLEPT THROUGH THE FIRST GORGE. It was called the Qutang\nGorge and was reputed to be the most dramatic of the three, the Yangtze\nnarrowing to 350 feet as it rushed beneath two-mile-high mountains. There\nwas some uncertainty among the Monkey King’s staff as to what time we\nwould reach the Qutang, but the general consensus was that we would pass\nthrough the gorge at daybreak, so I woke up early and waited on deck. Old\npeople were already doing their taiji exercises on the stern, and an enormous\nyellow moon followed us down the river. The valley was deeper now, the\nbare hills breaking into red cliffs of stone. The river flowed swift between the\nmountains. Mike joined me on deck, and together we watched the sunrise,\nwaiting for the gorge, until a passenger informed us that Wushan, our stop,\nwas just ahead. In the darkness we had slipped through the Qutang without",
        "knowing it.\n“Oh, well,” Mike said, disappointed, and then he brightened. “Hey, at\nleast we still have two more left.”\nThe town of Wushan was named after the mountain that loomed above its\nharbor, and the mountain was named after its resemblance to the character wu\n—“witch” or “wizard.” The town’s name meant Witch Mountain, and its\nwinding streets were decorated with Three Gorges water-level signs,\nforeshadowings of the hydroelectric wizardry yet to come. This was what\nMao Zedong had envisioned during a visit to Wushan in 1956, when he\ncomposed the poem “Swimming,” which describes how man can overcome\nnature through the glory of the dam:\nWalls of stone will stand upstream to the west\nTo hold back Wushan’s clouds and rain\nTill a smooth lake rises in the narrow gorges.\nIn the center of town, a billboard gave a detailed schedule for the\ncounty’s future. In 2003, when the first stage of the dam will be completed,\nthe river will rise 52.72 meters in Wushan, and then by 2009, when the\nproject is finished, the water will climb another 40 meters. By 2003, 37,908\npeople will be transferred to new homes; another 18,545 by 2009. All of this\nwas reported impassively by the billboard, which also noted the total area of\nmoved housing (1,026,082 square meters by 2003! An additional 530,094 by\n2009!), and the sign itself, with its dizzying flood of statistics, will be\ndrowned in a decade, mercifully.\nWushan was a classic river town, a larger version of Fuling’s old section,\nall tiled roofs and grimy steps and tiny alleys. The traffic was bad, taxis\nhonking their way angrily through the twisted Qing Dynasty streets, but that\nwouldn’t be a problem for long. They’d have a chance to start over, and\nundoubtedly the new Wushan would be better designed for automobiles. But\nin the meantime it was a good place for wandering and we spent two days\nthere, sleeping in the Red Flag Hotel and exploring the hills above the\nDaning River.\nThe Daning was cold and clear, rushing in angry rapids below sheer cliffs",
        "of limestone, and peasants above the cliffs were harvesting hay with scythes.\nThey tied the harvest into braids so it could be carried easily on metal-tipped\nstaves, which they used to haul the hay down to the river’s edge. On the\nbanks of the Daning they piled the hay onto wood flat-bottomed boats that\nrode the rapids down to Wushan and the Yangtze. It was a wild ride—a\nboatsman standing in the prow, using all his weight to steer an enormous\nsweep oar while another man worked a long oar to port. The hay would be\ntaken down the Yangtze to the city of Wuhan, where factories would churn it\ninto paper, and for their efforts the peasants made the equivalent of 2.4\nAmerican cents per pound, or forty-eight dollars for every ton of hay that was\ncut and braided and steered down the rushing river.\nWe spent a day hiking in the mountains, where the cliffs were so steep\nthat we couldn’t see the Daning far below, and the peasant children dropped\ntheir scythes and laughed in surprise whenever they saw us. Following the\nhay paths, we made our way down to the river, where we waved boats over to\nthe rocky shore to ask for rides. That was what we wanted—to ride the hay\nharvest down the cold clear Daning—but the peasants had been instructed\nthat waiguoren were contraband and they laughed and told us it was too\ndangerous. We bartered with one boatsman for a ride that everybody knew\nwas impossible, and he complimented us on our fledgling Chinese, and we\npraised the beauty of his countryside.\n“This place?” he said, cocking an eyebrow. “This place is too poor!”\n“But your scenery is very famous—that’s why we came.”\n“There aren’t any roads here,” he said. “Look at those people working in\nthe mountains—life here is too xinku, difficult. Every place with mountains\nlike this is poor.”\nHe shook his head and arranged the load on his boat. He was a small wiry\nman in his thirties and his eyes were hard and dark beneath a shock of black\nhair. When everything in the boat was ready, he lit a cigarette and set off for\nthe work of the rapids. But there was a gleam in his eye as he watched the\nriver, and when he hit the fast water his body grew taut, his face glowing with\nconcentration and skill and joy, the stubborn cigarette somehow surviving the\nspray of the mountain river.",
        "THE NEXT DAY we rode the Daning the way tourists were supposed to, on\nthe authorized boats that charged eighty yuan and came with a guide. He\nshowed us the rock formations we had paid to see—the Pig God Praising\nBuddha, the Dragon’s Head, the Horse’s Ass, the Lying Beauty—and the rest\nof the tourists, all of whom were Chinese, squealed in delight as they tried to\nrecognize the shapes in the broken cliffs. This was a ritual at every Chinese\nnature site; there seemed to be no value in the natural world unless it was\nlinked to man—some shape that a mountain recalled, or a poem that had been\nwritten about it, or an ancient legend that brought the rocks to life.\nThe guide also pointed out the tiny square holes that had been carved into\nthe cliff twenty feet above the river, where in ancient days there had been a\nplank road for the trackers who hauled the boats upstream. Legend said that it\nwas along this route that the Tang Dynasty concubine Yang Guifei had her\nfavorite lichees transported in the late ninth century, heading north to the\ncapital of Chang’an. In those days, Fuling’s lichees were considered the best\nin China—even today that is still one of Fuling’s nicknames, the Lichee City\n—and for Yang Guifei the fruit was carried down the Yangtze and up the\nDaning. She was one of Chinese history’s Four Great Beauties, the sort of\nwoman for whom lichees travel great distances, and her charms so beguiled\nthe Emperor Xuanzong that his control over the country’s affairs loosened\nuntil at last rebellion broke out. The emperor fled to Sichuan, and Yang\nGuifei tried to follow, but soldiers captured her and forced her to hang\nherself. The heartbroken emperor died in exile, and his son’s effort to\nmaintain control failed, and the Tang Dynasty, after ruling for nearly three\ncenturies, collapsed—all for the love of a beautiful woman who liked Fuling\nlichees.\nWe cruised north through the Daning’s Small Three Gorges, the river\nclear and bright in the morning sunshine. The empty hay boats were making\ntheir way back upstream, the peasants wading in the shallows and towing\ntheir craft by rope through the rapids. Golden monkeys scrambled over the\ncliffs of the Bawu Gorge, swinging heavily from bushes and calling out on\nthe banks behind us.\nSeveral times the boat stopped at concrete docks, where we disembarked\nand were ushered along new-built walkways, bordered by stand after stand of\npeasants selling the same goods: Three Gorges postcards, Three Gorges\nvideos, painted rocks, grinning Buddhas, fake jade bracelets, fake ancient",
        "compasses, fake old coins. There weren’t many tourists, because it was\nwinter, but still it was easier to sell fake things than cut hay and ride it down\nthe river for 2.4 cents a pound.\nAnd they knew the crowds would come in summer. All across China and\noverseas, a major advertising campaign was exhorting tourists to see the\nGorges before they were flooded, and the concrete walkways were part of the\npreparation for the mobs. There was something cynical about these ads:\nCome and see this place before we destroy it. But the campaign was\neffective: in 1997 Wushan would draw more tourists than any other Chinese\ncounty.\nThe peasants were aggressive salespeople, shouting and shoving their\nwares in our faces. By the third stop, I imagined the coming waters\ninundating the tourist walkways and their stalls, and I thought: Good. This\nwas how I sometimes felt on bad days in Fuling, when there was a hassle on\nthe docks and I became a sort of Chinese Noah. Let the waters come and\nwash all of this away.\nBut these dark thoughts disappeared once I was back on the river, gazing\nat the clear fast-flowing water. That would disappear as well—the Daning\nwas doomed to rise nearly three hundred feet, its gorges half filled, and these\nrapids would run clear no more. It would be part of the new reservoir, with\nthe same stagnant water as the Yangtze. Probably that would make things\neasier for the hay boats, but I suspected that the gleam in the boatsmen’s eyes\nwould also fade away.\nI felt the same sense of loss the next day, when we caught another slow\nboat down through the big gorges on the Yangtze. Again it was a lovely\nmorning, cold and bright, the wind whipping between the cliffs of the Wu\nGorge. We passed the Xiangxi River, home of Qu Yuan, the third-century-\nB.C. poet, and the home of Wang Zhaojun. She was another of the Four\nGreat Beauties, married off to the Huns for diplomatic reasons during the\nHan Dynasty. As a girl she had washed her handkerchiefs in the river; or\nperhaps she had washed the river in her handkerchiefs, because finally the\nwater ran fragrant, sweetened by the beauty on its banks, which was how it\ncame to be called the Xiangxi—the Fragrant River.\nThere was so much history along the Yangtze that one couldn’t harbor\nillusions about untouched nature. Every rock looked like something; every\ntributary carried its legends; every hill was heavy with the past. With all of",
        "this history, it was impossible to say that the new dam was an entirely new\nsort of violation: Wang Zhaojun had turned her river into perfume, and now\nLi Peng and the engineers would turn theirs into electricity. Even the relic of\nthe White Crane Ridge had started as a sort of vandalism—Tang Dynasty\nboatsmen scratching onto a perfectly innocent piece of sandstone—and if the\nman-made dam destroyed the man-made carvings, there was perhaps\nsomething appropriate about that. The engravings had been made to serve\nboatsmen, just as the river had always served man in so many ways.\nBut to have it simply stop—to turn the river into a lake—for some reason\nthat bothered me more than anything else. In a selfish way, I didn’t mind so\nmuch the lost temples, or the scenery’s lessened magnificence, or even the\ndisplaced people. The part that bothered me the most was all that stagnant\nwater; I didn’t want to see the Daning and the Xiangxi and the Yangtze slow\ndown. I couldn’t explain it other than that they were clearly meant to rush\nforward; that was their essential nature. There was power and life and\nexuberance in those rivers, and in a decade all of that would be lost.\nWe came out of the Xiling Gorge and cruised into the construction site of\nthe dam. It was absolutely indescribable—too many cranes, too many\ndredging boats, too many piles of dirt and stone on the river’s banks. I had\nmy notebook out but I wrote nothing; the size of the thing overwhelmed me.\nAcross a distant mountain an enormous propaganda sign proclaimed in\ntwenty-foot-high characters: “Build the Three Gorges, Exploit the Yangtze.”\nEven those eight characters, although they said a great deal, didn’t describe\nvery much.\nThe only describable part of the scene was our boat. It slowed as we\nreached the construction site, and every passenger came shivering onto the\ndeck. There were People’s Liberation Army soldiers, young couples with\ntheir babies, and old peasants in military surplus coats. Many of them had\nstayed in their cabins when we went through the Wu and Xiling Gorges,\nbecause it was so cold, but now everybody stood entranced on deck as we\npassed the cranes and trucks and piles of stone. They snapped pictures. They\npointed at the cranes. The Chinese flag flapped in the wind. I looked closely\nat the faces around me, and what I saw was awe and determination—awe at\nthe massive scale of the dam, and determination to withstand the cold and see\nevery inch of the project that they could. Even the babies seemed to have that\nlook in their eyes.",
        "THE WU RIVER\nTHE OLD FISHERMAN has no real hope of catching anything. “The\nfishing’s no good now,” he says. “In the winter it’s too cold; the fish don’t\nmove much. Mostly I come here because I’m retired—I come just to play.”\nHe smiles and looks out over the green water of the Wu River. The old man\nis perched on a rock, and beside him his rod is also sitting upright, anchored\nunder a stone. For hours at a stretch they sit beside each other, the old man\nand his fishing rod, and on cold days like today they are as silent and still as\nthe rocks themselves, until the fixed points of the scene—the rocks, the rod,\nthe old man—seem a world apart from the cold green water that rushes past\non its way to the Yangtze.\nEverything seems slow next to the current of the Wu. At the river’s\nmouth even the great Yangtze appears to stand still, its muddy water sluggish\nin comparison to the quick-moving tributary. The waters of the two rivers are\nso different that on a day like today their junction is defined by a line that\nlooks as sharp and straight as a border on a map: the Yangtze is brown, the\nWu green, and they meet like two slivers of painted glass that have been\npressed neatly together below the rough-browed peak of White Flat\nMountain.\nThe Wu is a mountain river. It starts in the heart of Guizhou province,\nwhere the hills are wild and the people few, and it falls east and north to\nSichuan. There are only a handful of cities along its length, none bigger than\nFuling, and so the water stays green and clear until it meets the Yangtze. The\nWu isn’t wide enough for big river cruisers—many of its navigable channels\nnarrow to thirty or forty feet during the dry season—and in any case there is\nno reason for the big boats to follow the green track upstream. Even here on\nthe banks of the East River district, where the heart of the city lies just across\nthe Wu, one can look upriver and see wild steep mountains in the distance.\nThey crowd against the narrow airspace above the river, and their rugged",
        "blue shapes give some sense of the remoteness of the upper Wu.\nAll rivers have distinct personalities, intangible traits that go beyond\nwidth and length and swiftness, and the two rivers in Fuling are so dissimilar\nthat their conversation is limited to the terse color line at the Wu’s mouth.\nThe Yangtze is peopled—it has been channeled, prodded, diverted, dammed;\nbuoys mark its shallows and boats of all sizes crest its polluted waters. It goes\nto Shanghai. The Wu—clear, green, lightly traveled—comes from the\nmountains. One river is all about origin; the other, destination: this is what\ndefines the contrast in their personalities. The Yangtze in its size and majesty\nseems to be going somewhere important, while the Wu in its narrow\nswiftness seems to have come from someplace wild and mysterious; and the\nfaint forms of its distant hills suggest that the river will keep its secrets. You\ncan fish all day long and the Wu will give you nothing.\nCarp are a slow-water fish and they are all the old man is hoping for,\nalong with the other eight fishermen who sit here with their rods. They are\nspread across a rocky inlet that breaks the river’s flow, their lines trailing off\ninto a dead spot where the water bulges slightly as the current rebounds from\nthe rocks. “The carp around here can be from one to eight pounds,” the old\nman says. “In town you’d pay seven or eight yuan a pound, but we don’t sell\nthem—we eat them ourselves. You can also catch black carp, but usually\nthat’s in the faster current. The river has yellow croaker, too—that’s the best\nfish in the Wu, but you can’t catch it here on the banks. It sells for twenty to\nthirty yuan a pound! And in the summer there’s grass carp, but in the\nsummer, when the fishing’s better, there are so many more people here.”\nThe fisherman is sixty-five years old, and for more than a decade he has\nbeen retired from the Chongqing factory where he used to work. He wears\nheavy-rimmed glasses and a dirty worn suit, and he is bent by age. They are a\ncontrast, this pair—the fragile-looking old man and his brand-new eight-foot-\nlong collapsible aluminum rod. “It cost one hundred and fifty yuan,” he says\nproudly. He is smoking, like all of the other men on the bank, and he smells\nfaintly of alcohol. He talks about another kind of fish, perhaps the best fish in\nthe river, the fish nobody ever catches. He says its name, but he is a dialect\nspeaker and the word—something like sanyu—is hard to understand, and he\ndoesn’t know how to write it. In any case, great fish are often nameless. “It’s\nvery rare and very good to eat,” he says, “but our government protects it. It\ncosts one hundred yuan a pound! If you catch it and nobody else is around,",
        "you can walk away. But if anybody else is there you have to throw it back.”\nHe says this with a certain seriousness, as if he were quoting from a law that\nexplicitly gives such instructions. He clears his throat and spits on the rocks,\nand then he looks down his empty line to the dead spot in the river.\nTHE CHARACTER for Wu is shaped vaguely like a bird—a tiny tuft on\ntop, a square head with a hooked beaklike notch, a single straight line that\nrepresents a wing. Like some Chinese characters, its form echoes part of the\nmeaning: “crow.” It also means black, or dark, and perhaps the name refers to\nthe color of the river, the way it swells an angry blue-black when storm\nclouds roll in over the valley, their heavy shadows bruising the water long\nbefore a drop has struck the surface.\nBut nobody in Fuling seems to know for certain the origin of the river’s\nname, and its color is as quicksilver as the brown Yangtze is unchanging. In\nsummer, when the rains are frequent and the snowmelt steady, the swollen\nWu tends to run a smooth brown, its color fading indistinctly into the muddy\nYangtze. As the dry season begins in late autumn, the river shifts from brown\nto gray to deep blue-green, until at last in winter it stretches like a narrow\nband of jade scratched white by the rapids.\nNow the dry season is past its midpoint but the spring rains have yet to\ncome, and for weeks the Wu has run blue-green without change. It is late\nafternoon; the rapids near the bank flicker in the setting sun. Beyond the old\nfisherman, slabs of sandstone are jumbled into the very heart of the river, and\na pair of students have leaped from rock to rock until they stand on a stony\nisland in the midst of the rushing current. It is a beautiful spot—so close to\nthe water that one can feel the cold air pushed by the current, the uneven chill\nthat the river has swept north all the way from Guizhou. The students sit on\nthe rock, gazing at the scenery, listening to the river. For a moment in the\nheart of the Wu there is no sound other than the fluid voice of its current.\nNorth of the students, a boat is docked near the road that runs down from\nthe East River district, and five men chat on the deck while the sun sets. Their\nboat is eighty feet long, its deck half covered with barrels of ferric oxide.\nTomorrow there will be more cargo to load, but today’s work is finished, and\nthe men smoke cigarettes while they rest and watch the sun drop.",
        "Soon they will be bound for the city of Jiangyin in Jiangsu province, a\nthousand miles down the Yangtze. They will float under the cliffs of the\nThree Gorges, past the lowlands and lakes of central China, and on toward\nthe country’s far east. The journey will take seven days.\n“Usually we don’t go that far,” says the owner of the boat. “Usually we\ngo to Hunan—we take these barrels downriver and then we bring back\nfeldspar for the ceramics factory. It takes about five days to get to Hunan.\nThat’s Chairman Mao’s home province, did you know? We usually stop\nabout half an hour from his hometown of Shaoshan. No, I’ve never been\nthere. But Hunan is good—it’s better than here. The transportation is more\ndeveloped, and so is the economy. It’s flatter there—it’s not a mountainous\nregion like this. Fuling has bad transportation. Most places I’ve seen in China\nare more developed than here.”\nThe man is forty-three years old, and without talking to him it would be\ndifficult to guess that he is the owner of the boat. He wears a dirty gray suit\nand tennis shoes, and he squats on the deck, smoking Magnificent Sound\ncigarettes. He smokes the cheap ones, the four-yuan packs that are the\nstandard for Fuling’s laobaixing, Old Hundred Names, the common folk. His\nhands are dirty. His shoulders are broad and strong. He is a hands-on boss; he\nsupervises the loading, and he rides down the Yangtze with the other eight\nworkers who make up his crew. Clearly he is close to the other men, and he\ncarries himself more or less as one of their equals—in fact, he is slow to\nacknowledge that the boat is his. But the others treat him with a quiet respect,\nand when a stranger approaches it is the boss who does most of the talking.\n“Two of the workers can drive,” he says. “I can’t, but you only need two\n—one to drive and one to rest. It’s harder to drive a boat than a car, you\nknow. It only takes two or three months of studying to learn to drive a car,\nbut on the river it takes five years before you’re ready for the examination. A\nlicense costs ten thousand yuan. It takes so much money and trouble because\nif you make a mistake with the boat, it’s very dangerous.\n“The Three Gorges aren’t too risky if you understand the river, though.\nOf course, if you don’t know the river, it’s difficult, but we’ve been through\nthere many times. And after all those trips it’s not so interesting anymore.\nThe scenery is beautiful, of course, but I’ve seen it many, many times.”\nHis remarks echo the words of another boatsman, written long ago: “Now\nwhen I had mastered the language of this water, and had come to know every",
        "trifling feature that bordered the great river as familiarly as I knew the letters\nof the alphabet, I had made a valuable acquisition. But I had lost something,\ntoo. I had lost something which could never be restored to me while I lived.\nAll the grace, the beauty, the poetry, had gone out of the majestic river!”\nAnd undoubtedly Mark Twain, who also lamented the construction of\nwing dams along the Mississippi, would have been even more saddened to\nsee a river like the Yangtze trapped behind huge walls of concrete. But this\nFuling boatsman is still a boatsman; his interest is shipping, not the lore and\nhistory and poetry of the river. He shrugs when asked about the new dam; it\nwon’t have much effect on his trade. The major change will be that he’ll have\nto traverse the new locks, an eight-step process that will likely take six or\nseven hours. But that won’t be a problem, and in any case he is a man who\nhas struggled against the river as often as he has been borne by its current. In\na small way he tames the Yangtze every month, and the taming of it on a\nlarger scale does nothing but impress him.\n“That dam is very big,” he says. “Have you seen it? Since they diverted\nthe river it’s very wonderful. Now we go through a side channel like this—”\nWith his finger he sketches on the deck of the boat: the bend of the new\ndiversion, the dry riverbed, the construction site. The other men watch,\ninterested. The sun has dipped below the western hills; the air is growing\ncolder. There are no boats on the Wu now and the twilit water has a purple\ntint.\nThe boat’s cabin glows white in the dying light. The men continue\ntalking, and the boss explains how most of his working life was spent as a\ntechnician for the local television broadcasting company. “It was a good job,”\nhe says. “The working conditions were good, but the salary was too low, so I\ndecided to change. I bought this boat in 1993, for more than four hundred\nthousand yuan. Most of the owners of this kind of boat are like me—we’re\nindependent, without a danwei. The owner decides where it goes and how\nlong it will take. That’s good—we have freedom. Usually we make about one\ntrip a month, and then we rest here in Fuling. This is our hometown, myself\nand all the workers. It’s good to see other parts of China, but this is where we\nlive.”\nHe motions broadly with his Magnificent Sound cigarette—to the hills of\nthe East River district, to the fading blue mound of Raise the Flag Mountain,\nto the gray downtown buildings and their early-evening lights. The lights",
        "streak orange across the dark rapids of the untamed Wu, illuminating the cold\nclean water that rushes into the brown Yangtze and then runs eastward—past\nthe Three Gorges, past Mao’s home province, past Jiangyin, where the men\nwill finish their next journey, past Shanghai to its muddy mouth and the\nemptiness of the East China Sea.",
        "CHAPTER FIVE",
        "Opium Wars\nI LEARNED ABOUT DENG XIAOPING’S DEATH from Anne, one of\nmy students. I had just returned from vacation; it was the heart of the dry\nseason and the Wu River was low. Children along the shoreline flew kites,\nthe way they did all across China after the Spring Festival.\nOn February 20, I noticed that the Chinese flag on the teaching building\nwas at half-mast. But I didn’t think much of it until I went to get my spare\nkey from Anne, who lived downstairs and had been watching my apartment.\n“Have you heard what happened?” she asked.\n“Here in the college?”\n“No, in Beijing,” she said. “Deng Xiaoping is dead.”\nI said that I was sorry, and I asked when he had passed away.\n“Yesterday. They told us on the television today before noon. When I\nheard, I felt like crying.”\nShe smiled as she spoke, but it was the Chinese smile that served as a\nmask against deeper feelings. Those smiles could hide many emotions—\nembarrassment, anger, sadness. When the people smiled like that, it was as if\nall of the emotion was wound tightly and displaced; sometimes you caught a\nglimpse of it in the eyes, or at the corner of a mouth, or perhaps in a single\nwrinkle stretching sadly across a forehead. Anne had high cheekbones and\ndeep dimples, and today I thought I saw a trace of her sadness wavering\nalong her cheek.\n“The funeral will be on Tuesday,” she said. “They will cancel class in the\ncollege.”\n“Well,” I said, “he had a very long life.”\n“He was ninety-three years old. I think that everybody in China is sad\ntoday. Especially here in Sichuan—you know that Deng Xiaoping was from\nSichuan.”\nShe smiled once more, but now the sadness at her dimple shivered away",
        "into pride. I took my key and thanked her, heading back upstairs to my\napartment.\nI thought about Anne’s father, the math professor who had spent eight\nyears of the Cultural Revolution working in a Sichuan coal mine, and I knew\nthat Deng Xiaoping had suffered hardships of the same kind. He had been\npurged twice, and his son had been paralyzed after a mysterious fall from an\nupper-story window during an interrogation by Red Guards. And yet Deng\nhad survived to lead the country out of the Cultural Revolution, and he was\nresponsible for the recovery of people like Anne’s father.\nThere had been no other modern Chinese leader quite like Deng\nXiaoping. His appearance was unassuming; he was short, and as a young man\nhe hadn’t been handsome like Zhou Enlai and Mao Zedong. He had grown up\nin the countryside northeast of Chongqing, where he acquired the tastes and\nhabits of a peasant. His spitting was famous, at least overseas—virtually\nevery foreign description of Deng Xiaoping noted that he spat loudly during\nimportant meetings. But he was capable of what the Chinese called “eating\nbitter”—enduring hardships—and he had a practical, hard-headed\nintelligence, which was why he was able to turn China away from the\ndisasters of a state-run economy. He was blunt, too, which was one reason\nwhy the pro-democracy demonstrations in 1989 had been suppressed with\nsuch violence. Much of what was good and bad about the Sichuanese could\nbe seen in the character of Deng Xiaoping.\nMany of my students were from Guang’an, the same region where Deng\nhad grown up. During the first semester I had asked Anne’s third-year class\nto write about their heroes, and, apart from the eleven students who chose\npeople in their families, the results were as follows:\nSeven wrote about Mao Zedong.\nFour wrote about Deng Xiaoping.\nFour wrote about Zhou Enlai.\nThree selected Napoleon, because he “broke the system of\nfeudalism in Europe.”\nOne chose Kong Fansen, a Chinese worker-martyr who died in\nTibet.\nOne chose George Washington.",
        "One chose Nathan Hale, “an American revolutionary.”\nOne chose Muhammad Ali.\nThey had a taste for heroes who made Revolution. Even Ali was a\nrevolutionary of sorts, a man who gave up his livelihood to protest against the\nVietnam War. I admired Ali myself, but it bothered me that so many of my\nstudents idolized Mao Zedong. Wendy, who was one of the brightest in the\nclass, wrote:\nThough [Mao] is responsible for the Great Cultural Revolution, we\nmustn’t deny his achievements. As everyone knows, no gold is pure, no\nman is perfect. So we must look at things dialectically. He is the savior\nand the Red Sun of China, and he is my hero, too.\nSeth wrote along the same lines:\nOf course, Mao had a lot of mistakes, but one flaw cannot obscure the\nsplendor of the jade. He is still respected by Chinese people. His body\nblend with China’s mother earth. It can be asserted that if there is no\nMao, Chinese revolution would be much inferior. So I think Mao\nZedong fully deserve a worthy [spot] in the world’s history. I am afraid\nonly Lenin and Churchill can compare with him.\nTeaching in Fuling forced me into something approaching a personal\nrelationship with China’s past leaders, which was strange considering that\nthey had meant nothing to me during the first twenty-seven years of my life.\nBut now I encountered them everywhere—the entrance of the college library\nhad a wall-sized replica of Mao’s calligraphy, and his portrait hung in the\nbuilding where I taught. Taxi drivers dangled Deng icons from their rearview\nmirrors. Students talked about China’s politicians all the time; their writing\nwas heavy with Mao quotes, and they referred constantly to Deng Xiaoping\nand Zhou Enlai. To the people in Fuling, these men were much more than\npolitical leaders, and in turn I found myself developing strong feelings about",
        "each of them. It was like living in a new land and coming to grips with the\ngods they worshiped there.\nI disliked Mao intensely. This was not unusual for a waiguoren; there\nweren’t many reasons to like him when you came from outside. Much of\nMao’s appeal lay in his inspiring the Chinese to be proud of themselves and\ntheir country, but to a foreigner most of this pride seemed hollow—ignorance\nand jingoism, smoke and mirrors. In Fuling I came to dislike the sight of his\nfat smug face, and I disliked his pithy sayings and neat theories that were so\neasily memorized. Especially I disliked Mao’s story “The Foolish Man Who\nMoved the Mountain,” which was a favorite of my students’. It was a simple\nfable: An old man lived near an inconvenient mountain, and he tried to\nconvince the other villagers to help him move it. Of course, everybody\nscoffed at him; you can’t move a mountain! But the old man was stubborn, as\nwell as dedicated, and every day he shoveled alone at the mountain. At last\nhe moved the entire thing all by himself, and the villagers realized they had\nbeen wrong.\nPerhaps it was a useful story for children, but Mao had made this sort of\nnonsense the foundation of economic policies that affected hundreds of\nmillions of people. The 1958–1961 Great Leap Forward had been about old\nmen moving mountains: peasants were told to smelt iron in their backyards\nso that China’s industrial production could overtake Britain’s, and the result\nwas massive deforestation and the worst famine in mankind’s recorded\nhistory, killing between 30 and 45 million people. Yet less than four decades\nlater, my students still wrote about how they were inspired by “The Foolish\nMan Who Moved the Mountain.” Every time I read a student’s summary of\nthe story, something inside of me tightened and I nearly responded: Leave the\nmountain alone, you old jackass. But of course I refrained, the same way I\nwas careful not to let my students know that I hated Mao Zedong.\nZhou Enlai baffled me—he was the most foreign of the Chinese gods. He\nwas also the most respected; nationwide polls showed that he was by far the\nbiggest hero of the younger generation. They admired him because he was a\nmaster diplomat, and because he had softened the damage of the Cultural\nRevolution. These points were true—there was no doubt that his skills had\ndeeply impressed every foreign dignitary he ever met, and it seemed clear\nthat the Red Guards would have done even worse damage if Zhou had not\nreined them in at key points. But unlike Deng Xiaoping, Zhou had never",
        "openly opposed the destruction, and even at the height of the madness he\ncould be found onstage at the rallies, waving his Little Red Book along with\nall the other fanatics.\nI thought there was something slippery about him—he was handsome and\nbrilliant, and he was good at saving his own skin. I felt that a mature\npolitician who had maintained a high position throughout the Cultural\nRevolution could not be an entirely good man, just as any adult German who\nhad risen in the Nazi hierarchy was at least partly complicit in its crimes. But\nfor the Chinese, this was an over-simplification; they were more likely to see\na politician like Zhou as an Oskar Schindler—a man who recognized the\nsystem as wrong but worked from within to temper its ill effects. There is a\nsort of pragmatic heroism in such figures, and the Chinese have always been\npragmatists, much more so than Westerners.\nI was much more sympathetic, though, to Deng Xiaoping’s brand of\npragmatism. He had his share of flaws—he had been prominent in the Anti-\nRightist campaigns of the late 1950s, when Mao solidified his hold on the\ncountry, and of course Deng had approved the violent repression of the 1989\nprotests. But at least he was capable of departing from the Party line, which\nhe proved during the Cultural Revolution, when he stepped away from the\nfawning example of Zhou Enlai and criticized the movement. As a result,\nDeng was purged, his family was punished, and his son was thrown out of a\nwindow. His criticism wasn’t very political, but he wasn’t the sort of man\nwho was interested in politics for its own sake. And he was a survivor—\nalbeit in a very different way from Zhou Enlai. I liked this about him, and\nespecially I liked Deng Xiaoping because he reflected what I admired most\nabout the Sichuanese—their toughness and their lack of pretension. In the\nend he was the only Chinese god that I understood, and I felt a touch of\nsadness at his passing.\nON THE TUESDAY MORNING after Deng Xiaoping died, there was a\nmemorial service in Beijing’s Great Hall of the People. It was broadcast live\non China Central Television, and every danwei in the country was expected\nto gather and watch the ceremony together. All flags were flown at half-mast,\nand at ten o’clock, when the service began, there was a three-minute period",
        "of nationwide mourning during which factories, boats, warships, cabs, trucks,\nand trains blew their whistles and horns. In China, that kind of memorial was\nmuch easier to organize than a moment of silence.\nOur morning classes were canceled, and all of the students and teachers\nin the English department met in a lecture hall to watch the service. The\nteachers gathered at the front of the room. Adam and I took places at the\nback, because we were uncertain of the protocol and didn’t want to draw\nattention. Horns echoed up from the rivers as everybody stood solemnly.\nParty Secretary Zhang led the ceremony in the classroom. He followed\nthe televised service and gave sharp commands to the students and teachers:\nwe stood when the dignitaries in the Great Hall of the People stood, and we\nkowtowed when they kowtowed. Together we bent forward at the waist three\ntimes, slowly, and then Party Secretary Zhang told us to sit down for the\nmemorial speech.\nPresident Jiang Zemin spoke for fifty minutes. At the start he was broken\nup, wiping his face and sobbing, and I could see that some of the students\nwere also crying. A handful of freshmen boys in the back started to giggle.\nBut they kept quiet and most of the group was sober, and after ten minutes\neverybody was simply bored. From outside I could hear the sounds of\nlaborers working on the new dormitory behind my apartment. I thought that\nof all the memorials, Deng would have liked that one the most—the steady\nhomage of clinking chisels as yet another building was constructed in China.\nAfter the service was over, Adam and I walked home with Teacher Liu.\nShe was one of the highest-ranking teachers in our department, a fifty-three-\nyear-old woman who was married to Party Secretary Wei, the top Communist\nParty cadre in the college. They lived on the third floor of our building, but I\nhad rarely spoken with Teacher Liu—like most of the cadres, she seemed\nslightly uncomfortable around us. But today for some reason she was eager to\ntalk as we made our way around the empty croquet court.\n“I am almost the same age as New China,” she said. “I was six years old\nwhen they started New China. So in some respect I saw New China grow up\n—we were both young at the same time. You probably have heard that in the\nearly years after Liberation there were many political campaigns. Especially\nin the 1960s and the 1970s—in those years there were always political\ncampaigns.”\nThe three of us came to our apartment building. As a sign of mourning",
        "she wore a white paper flower on her chest, and she fiddled with it when we\nstopped at the entrance. She looked up at me with a tight blank smile but her\neyes glistened full of tears.\n“The political campaigns didn’t stop until Deng Xiaoping came,” she\nsaid. “We were so happy.”\nFor a few seconds she fumbled with her words. She held everything\ncarefully—the smile frozen on her face, the tears hanging stubbornly in her\neyes. She gathered herself and spoke again.\n“Now we have so much freedom,” she said, in a sort of fierce whisper.\n“We are so free. We have so much freedom now.”\nI stood there awkwardly, nodding as if I understood. I couldn’t imagine\nthinking that life in the college was any sort of true freedom, although I knew\nthat I would feel differently if I had spent the Cultural Revolution in China.\nAnd perhaps I also would have felt differently if I were married to the\nhighest-ranking Communist official in the college. I knew this thought was\ninappropriate but still I couldn’t push it away.\nShe seemed to sense this—not so much my different concept of freedom\nas my inability to imagine the horrors of China’s past.\n“You can’t know what it was like,” she said. “In those days we had so\nlittle. Half a jin of meat.” She said it hungrily, her eyes fixed on me. A jin\nwas slightly more than a pound.\n“Half a jin of meat for one month,” she said. “Every month we had\ntwenty-seven jin of rice. That’s all—twenty-seven jin! Do you know how\nlittle that is? Now a family might eat that much in a week; for us it was a\nmonth. An entire month! In those times we were always hungry.” She held\nher stomach, her eyes still glistening, and I realized that true hunger was even\nharder for me to imagine than being overjoyed at the freedom of Fuling\nTeachers College.\n“When I finished university,” she said, “I was sent to the remote\ncountryside. It was near the Wu River, almost to Guizhou. I was a peasant.\nYou must remember that my home was Chongqing; I was not from the\ncountryside. I was not a peasant. But I could not go back to my home. For\nthree years I was a peasant, and then for three years I taught in a country\nschool. Middle school. I taught the students to read.\n“You cannot imagine those times. Jiang Qing”—she hissed the name, the\nway I’d heard other Chinese say it—“Jiang Qing, Mao’s wife, she said no",
        "need to learn, no reason to learn the ABCs. No ABCs!” And she repeated it a\nfew times, her voice rising angrily—no ABCs, no ABCs, no ABCs. She\nseemed to realize that it sounded almost silly to be crying and saying that, but\nthere was no other way to express what it was like to have been an educated\ncity woman in the countryside, a teacher with nothing to teach. Even now\nthere was no way to tell us what it was like to be fifty-three years old and still\nburn with the memory of time wasted like that. Adam and I stood there in\nsilence. I thought that I should say something, and finally I asked her how\ntoday had been different from the services when Mao died in 1976.\n“At that time, every danwei had a committee in charge of mourning,” she\nsaid: “We wore white, we made wreaths, and for a week there was mourning.\nEverybody worked for the funeral. Students, teachers, workers, peasants—\neverybody worked. Everything was stopped. This time it is very different.”\nShe swept the air with her arm, gesturing out to the teaching building, the\ncity, the boats on the rivers. “This,” she said, “is cheap.”\nShe spat out the word, and then she wiped her eyes and went inside the\nbuilding. I had seen more emotion from her in five minutes than I usually saw\nin weeks of Fuling conversations. I passed her in the street the next day and\nshe smiled but said nothing, the same way she always had in the past. Over\nthe next year and a half we never had another serious conversation.\nFOR THE FIRST SIX WEEKS of term, all of the third-year students\nreturned to their hometowns to do practice teaching, and I only had four\nhours of class a week. They were first-year speaking classes and the\npreparation work was not difficult. My job took perhaps five hours a week.\nBy now Adam and I were spending less time together, although usually\nwe met for a meal at least once a day. We had always been concerned about\nrelying too much on each other, which was a common pattern for Peace\nCorps volunteers in China. Living as a foreigner in a small town in Sichuan\nwas often difficult, and the temptation was to withdraw into the foreign\ncommunity—even if it was a community of only two.\nThis was an easy way to miss whatever the town had to offer, and it was\nalso an easy way to ruin a friendship. Somehow, most of the Peace Corps\npairings worked out, but there were a few that didn’t, sometimes",
        "spectacularly. Occasionally volunteers could hardly speak to each other after\na year. This wasn’t what either Adam or I wanted from our experience in\nFuling, and so that was our balancing act—to be friends without the\nclaustrophobia, to support without leaning.\nProbably it helped that in certain respects we were similar. Adam was\nfrom Minnesota; I was from Missouri; both of us had gone to university on\nthe East Coast. Our parents taught in colleges. We had lived overseas before.\nEach of us was independent—that was crucial. And each of us had an\nanalytical turn of mind, which was often how we dealt with Fuling, talking\nwith each other as we tried to figure out why things happened the way they\ndid.\nBut we spent most of our time together doing what the Chinese call chui\nniu—“blowing the bull.” We told old stories and talked sports; we joked\naround and created our own mythology of Fuling, composed of the places\nand people we saw every day: Rat Girl, Jackson, Left Eye, Copy Girl, the\nClub, the Karaoke Boat, the Hepatitis B Barber Shop. None of it would have\nmade sense to anybody else, like our language itself. Really we had four\nlanguages: Chinese; Special English, which we used when speaking slowly\nwith the students; Normal English, for the rare times when we happened to\ngo someplace where there were other waiguoren; and Fuling English, which\nwas what we spoke when we were together. Fuling English consisted of a\ncombination of slang from our previous lives, references to the local\nmythology, and a sort of pidgin Chinese: certain useful Chinese words and\nphrases, spoken without tones, and often corrupted with an English “s” at the\nend (there are no plurals in Chinese and words never end in an “s” sound). In\nour Fuling English, guanxi meant “relationship” xiaojies were “young\nwomen” mafan was “trouble.” When you spent that much time with a person\nit was inevitable that you developed your own language—and part of that\nlanguage was that there were many things that didn’t have to be said at all.\nThe need for space was one of those unspoken understandings, and\nduring the start of the second semester we began to drift into more\nindependent lives. I focused on studying Chinese, and I also started to spend\nmore time in the city, which was slowly becoming less intimidating. I\nrealized that the key was finding places I went to regularly—it was no good\njust to wander around downtown Fuling, because that way I attracted too\nmuch attention and the passersby shouted at me. It was better to go to the",
        "same places at the same times every week, and then the people became\naccustomed to me and it was easier to have conversations.\nOften I stopped by the South Mountain Gate Park, where there was a\nphotographer named Ke Xianlong who was interesting to talk with. He was a\ndialect speaker but he was very patient, and three or four times a week I’d\ntalk with him and then make my way up to the Wangzhou Park at the top of\nFuling City.\nThe park had a nice teahouse where I’d sip tea and study my textbook.\nThere was a friendly xiaojie named Song Furong who worked there, along\nwith some other girls whose names I never learned, and we’d kid each other\nand they’d teach me words I shouldn’t know. I always used the words\ninnocently, as if I had no idea what I was saying, and the xiaojies would\ncover their mouths and howl with laughter.\nI started to realize that in a place like Fuling it actually wasn’t so difficult\nto learn spoken Chinese once you had the foundation. Virtually nobody knew\nEnglish, and there was so much curiosity about waiguoren that people\nconstantly approached me, and once we started talking there seemed no limit\nto their interest and patience. The most important part of my study routine\nwas simply making myself available—I sat in the teahouse with my textbook,\nand whoever was walking past would stop to see what the waiguoren was\nreading. We’d start talking and if it was a good conversation it would last for\nthirty minutes, and then somebody else would stop. I’d spend three hours\nthere, the xiaojies refilling my cup whenever it cooled, and in that time I’d\nhave conversations with more than a dozen people. The city was teaching me\nChinese.\nAbove the teahouse was a karaoke bar where they had prostitutes, and\nsometimes young men would walk past me on their way upstairs. Often they\nwere drunk, moving in packs with their beepers and cigarettes, and\nsometimes they’d stop to talk. Usually I could tell they just wanted to give\nthe waiguoren a hard time and I’d pretend I didn’t understand, and they’d\nlaugh and move on. Song Furong thought that was funny, and after the young\nmen had left we’d talk about why I hadn’t liked them. That was something\nelse I realized that semester: One of the benefits of being a waiguoren was\nthat nobody could tell how much you knew.\nI had finished the language lessons about catching trains and saying\ngoodbye, and now my new textbook dealt with Chinese history and politics.",
        "It was a Chinese-published book with a Chinese political agenda, which\nmade the classes much more interesting, because the vocabulary was useful\nand I could watch the way my tutors reacted to the material. One chapter\nfeatured a political debate between two fictional American students of\nChinese, one of whom asked how it was possible that China could be a\ndemocratic country when it was led by only one party. The other American\nstudent, named John, answered:\nWhy can’t a country led by a single party achieve a high level of\ndemocracy? The Chinese Communist Party represents the interests of\nevery group, and the Chinese people enjoy wide-ranging democratic\nrights.\nWhen we reviewed that lesson one day in class, Teacher Kong paused\nand ran his finger over the paragraph. “Some people,” he said, “would not\nagree with that.”\nI said that I didn’t know much about it, although most Americans had\ntheir own opinions about Chinese politics.\n“What do most Americans think?” he asked.\n“Most Americans think that China is not a democratic country.”\nI wouldn’t have said that to any of my students, or anybody on the street,\nbut it was different with Teacher Kong. I knew he wasn’t a dissident—and\nindeed he would join the Communist Party himself the next year—but he was\nslow to judge and he could listen to ideas without either flatly accepting or\nrefuting them. In Fuling those were rare qualities.\n“Our China is different from America, I think,” he said. “The education\nlevel in America is higher. Most of the Chinese are peasants, and if they\nchose our leaders directly it would be dangerous, because anybody could lie\nto them, or trick them. China isn’t ready for that yet. But that’s just my\nopinion—I don’t know if it’s correct or not.”\nHe appeared to be slightly uncomfortable with the subject and I didn’t\npursue it. And in truth I wasn’t certain about my own notion of democracy,\nwhich had broadened considerably since my arrival in China. Part of this was\nbecause the Chinese government also claimed the word, which made me",
        "consider how it was sometimes abused in America. Teacher Kong’s remark\nwas cynical, but at the same time there was a strain of idealism in the way he\nlooked at American-style democracy, because he didn’t realize that in fact the\npoor and uneducated rarely bothered to vote in the United States. Sometimes\nthat was how I felt about democracy—regardless of whether it was the\nChinese or the American government claiming to be empowered by the\ncommon man, part of it was dishonest wordplay. But even at my most cynical\nI recognized that there was an enormous difference in the degree of\ndishonesty.\nLiving in Fuling taught me that democracy is as much a matter of\ntolerance as of choice. After talking with Teacher Kong, I thought about my\nown participation in America’s system, and I realized just how shallow my\ninvolvement had been. I had never cast a vote that truly made a difference,\nand I never would; elections are not decided by a single tally. Nor had I ever\nplayed a major role in organizing a demonstration, and I had yet to react to an\ninjustice by writing letters or alerting the press. Essentially, this was the\nextent of my role in American democracy: casting meaningless votes and\naccepting the results. But still I didn’t feel particularly powerless, because I\nknew that my role resulted from my own decisions, and I could always\nincrease my involvement if something struck me as intolerable. In the past I\nhad simply chosen not to be involved, and this choice was just as democratic\nas any positive act.\nMany of these democratic options had been made extremely difficult in\nFuling, where the price of dissent was high. Or at least I assumed that it was,\nbecause I had read about Chinese dissidents; I certainly didn’t meet very\nmany in Fuling. It was far more common to meet people like Teacher Kong,\nwho seemed uninspired by the notion of democracy. Of course, such citizens\nwere the natural by-product of a system like China’s, but this worked both\nways: the Chinese system could also be seen as the natural creation of people\nwho had little faith in their own power. As to which had come first, the\npeople or the system, that was hard to say. But it was striking that while most\nFuling residents were completely disengaged from public affairs, there wasn’t\na strong sense of powerlessness that accompanied this condition. Rather they\ndidn’t seem to care very much, and it wasn’t much different from the way I\nfelt in America. In the end, Fuling struck me as a sort of democracy—perhaps\na Democracy with Chinese Characteristics—because the vast majority of the",
        "citizens quietly tolerated the government. And the longer I lived there, the\nmore I was inclined to see this as the silent consent of people who had chosen\nnot to exercise other options.\nThe week after my class with Teacher Kong, I reviewed the same chapter\nin my textbook with Teacher Liao. When we came to John’s response, I\nasked her what she thought.\n“That’s correct,” she said. “China is a democratic country.”\n“But some Chinese think it’s a problem that there’s only one party, don’t\nthey?” I asked.\n“No,” she said. “All of us support the Communist Party. And we have\nelections all the time—we had one recently. China is a democratic country.”\n“Do you think that China has any Capitalist Characteristics?” I asked,\nbecause this was something else that Teacher Kong and I had discussed. We\nhad talked about the way capitalism was taking hold as Chinese state-owned\nenterprises were privatized, and how the reforms allowed people to own\nprivate businesses. But everything was different with Teacher Liao—the\nlanguage was the same, but its political parameters shifted dramatically\nwhenever I changed between my two teachers.\n“China has no Capitalist Characteristics,” she said flatly. “It is Socialism\nwith Chinese Characteristics.”\nIt was pointless to argue with Teacher Liao, at least with regard to\npolitics, where she strictly followed the government line. And it was\nremarkable how far this line stretched; in Fuling bookstores you could buy a\ncopy of the Constitution of the People’s Republic of China, which included\nArticle 35, Section II:\nCitizens of the People’s Republic of China enjoy freedom of speech,\nof the press, of assembly, of association, of procession, and of\ndemonstration.\nThat was almost as good as the slave-owning American revolutionaries\nwriting about equality. My favorite part of the Chinese Constitution was\nArticle 32, Section 1:",
        "The People’s Republic of China may grant asylum to foreigners who\nrequest it for political reasons.\nNewspapers were the same way, and anybody in Fuling who wanted real\nnews relied on either the Voice of America, itself a propaganda organ, or\nxiaodao xiaoxi, which translated as “small alley news,” or word of mouth. It\nseemed incredible that in a modernizing country of China’s size many people\nturned to rumor as the most reliable source for information about current\nevents. To me, this was the most substantial political distinction between\nAmerica and China—even though much of what America believed about\nitself was also fraudulent, at least the press and publishers could express\nunorthodox views. It wasn’t until I went to China that I realized a person\ncould become homesick for conspiracy theories.\nAt the start of the spring semester, an English-speaking teacher from\nanother department asked if he could borrow some literature books, and I\ninvited him to stop by my apartment. I showed him my small collection—\nHemingway, Jack London, Mark Twain, a Norton Anthology. I also had\nsome political books about China, which he examined carefully.\n“Those books all criticize China,” I said. “I don’t know if they are true or\nnot, but probably you wouldn’t like them.”\nHis eyes lit up. He was a tiny man with thick glasses and a jutting jaw,\nand he took my copy of China Wakes and looked at the back cover. “In China\nwe can’t get books like this,” he said.\n“That book is very negative,” I said. “It was written by two reporters for\nthe New York Times. Some of it is about the student protests in 1989.”\n“Can I borrow it?” he asked.\nI saw no harm in that and I gave him the book. I asked him how he\nusually found out about things that were forbidden, and he mentioned the\nsmall alley news. Recently the foreign press had carried reports of ethnic\nunrest in the far-western province of Xinjiang, and out of curiosity I asked if\nhe had heard anything.\n“I’ve heard that there are some problems there,” he said. “Or actually,\nthey said on the television that there are no problems there. But if there were\nno problems, why would they say so on the television? So I knew there must\nbe something wrong. But I don’t know exactly what is happening.”",
        "I gave him a recent copy of Newsweek that included an article about\nXinjiang, and he took his book and left. Over the semester he came\nperiodically to borrow my books, although he never said much about what he\nthought of them. He was a shy, quiet man who never seemed comfortable\ntalking with me, and it was the same way with a couple of young English\nteachers who occasionally stopped by my apartment. I sensed that these men\nwere searching for friendship, but something seemed to be holding them\nback. Perhaps it was their own uncertainty, but more likely it was the\nwarnings of the college; I never learned for sure. To me they were nothing\nmore than shadowy figures who seemed to be groping for something that\ncouldn’t be found in Fuling.\nTeacher Liao was different—she had no patience for the foreign view of\nChina. In some ways I couldn’t blame her; the American press tended to\nportray a China that was overwhelmingly negative and Beijing-centered. And\nyet like any waiguoren in China, I knew that I had access to a great deal of\ninformation that was unavailable to the Chinese, and as a result I often felt as\nif I understood the political situation better than the locals. It was impossible\nto avoid this type of arrogance, even though I realized that it was misleading\nand condescending, and I was careful not to voice my opinions openly. But\nTeacher Liao obviously noticed my skepticism about the material we studied,\nand I, in turn, sensed her suspicion of what I had been taught in America. She\nliked that I was learning Chinese fairly quickly, and I could see that she\nrespected my efforts to study the language. But as my Chinese improved we\nbegan to see each other more clearly, and soon there was no avoiding the\ncentral issue in our relationship: that I was a waiguoren and she was Chinese.\nDuring the spring semester our relationship grew increasingly unhealthy,\nfueled by the political and historical lessons in my book, and often there was\na definite tension as we prodded each other carefully. When the textbook\ndiscussed the Opium Wars, she quietly pointed out that America had also\nbenefited from the unequal treaties that were forced upon the Chinese, and\nshe lingered over the description of the waiguoren looting and burning the\nSummer Palace. During our review of the chapter on science and technology,\nshe was careful to note that although the American experts had said there\nwere no major oil reserves in China, native scientists had discovered the vast\nDaqing fields after Liberation. This pleased Teacher Liao immensely—she\npointed out that the Chinese were now self-sufficient in oil, whereas America",
        "had to rely on the Middle East.\nI had never been a patriot, and certainly I had never been patriotic about\noil, but things were different now—I was a waiguoren, and I was developing\na waiguoren’s sensitivity to any sort of slight. The second time Teacher Liao\nbragged about China’s oil self-sufficiency, I noted that China had actually\nbecome a net oil importer in 1995. Although Teacher Liao distrusted my\nsources (Newsweek), I could see that she was annoyed by the readiness and\nprecision of my statistics. And I pointed out that Americans don’t worry\nmuch about being self-sufficient in things like oil, because we have good\nrelations with many countries and have never made an effort to close\nourselves to the outside world. More sensible voices sounded in my head—\nwhat about Pat Buchanan? America First? the anti-Chinese laws in the\nnineteenth century?—but balance was not my goal. I was fighting fire with\nfire, and I responded to propaganda with more of the same.\nThose were our Opium Wars—quiet and meaningless battles over\nChinese and American history, fueled by indirect remarks and careful\ninnuendo. The same thing was happening in Adam’s classes, and sometimes\nwe discussed the best way to react when Teacher Liao started to needle us\nabout the unequal treaties or the loss of Hong Kong. It was difficult because\nshe always had the advantage; the book was on her side, and so was the\nlanguage. In Chinese, the Korean War is known as the “War of Resistance\nAgainst the Americans and in Support of the Koreans,” and it is difficult to\ndiscuss a war with that name and make the Americans look good. And the\nChinese use personal pronouns when they speak of national affairs—it’s “our\nChina” and “your America.” I found this to be a small but critical quirk in the\nlanguage; every political discussion quickly became polarized, and every\naspect of America—both its successes and its failures—became my personal\naffair.\nIn response, Adam and I learned to attack Teacher Liao’s soft spots. It\nwas always effective to mention innocently how rich Hong Kong had become\nunder British rule, and we knew that we could get a rise out of her by talking\nabout Premier Li Peng. He wasn’t popular in China—in particular, many\nChinese intellectuals hated him, because of his old-style conservatism and\nbecause he had supported the use of violence in quelling the Tiananmen\nSquare protests. And it was no secret that the foreign press criticized him\nmercilessly. One day there was a lull in class and I brought up the subject,",
        "just to see how Teacher Liao would react.\n“What do the Chinese people think of Li Peng?” I asked.\n“All of us like Li Peng,” she said quickly. Invariably her responses were\nlike that—all or nothing, white or black.\nI nodded and continued, “He had some guanxi with Zhou Enlai, didn’t\nhe?”\n“What do you mean?”\n“I don’t know how to say it—I read in a history book that Li Peng didn’t\nhave parents.” I was trying to say “orphan” in a roundabout way I was hoping\nto get to nepotism. “How do you say it if a child doesn’t have parents?” I\nasked.\n“Sishengzi?” she said.\n“Right,” I said. “I read that Li Peng was a sishengzi, and Zhou Enlai took\ncare of him.”\nHer reaction was immediate.\n“Budui!” she said angrily. “That’s foreign luanshou! That’s waiguoren\ntalking noise! It’s not true! I know you read that in your foreign newspapers,\nbut it’s completely false!”\nIt was the first time I’d seen her openly angry, and I had never imagined\nthat Li Peng’s adoption was such a touchy subject. I asked her to write that\nword, sishengzi, and she scratched it hard on my notebook, her face red. The\nthree characters translated literally as “personal child.” I grabbed my\ndictionary and looked it up: “illegitimate child; bastard.” I had been saying\nthat Li Peng was Zhou Enlai’s bastard son.\n“Uhm,” I said, “that’s not the right word. Sorry.”\nI picked up the dictionary again and fumbled through it until I found the\ncorrect term: gu’er. I apologized again for the mistake and she seemed\nrelieved; yes, she said, Li Peng had been adopted by Zhou Enlai. I left it at\nthat—I was embarrassed to have pushed her so far, even if it had been partly\nunintentional. The next class she asked me pointedly why the American\ngovernment helped its athletes take performance-enhancing drugs, and we\nwent around again, this time with me on the defensive. And so it went every\nother week, our Opium Wars raging as the countdown to Hong Kong’s return\ndrew closer and closer.",
        "ONE DAY IN LATE MARCH, I was studying Chinese at my desk when I\nsaw a lizard skittering across the ceiling. He was dull green with bulging\nblack eyes, and he moved in jerks and starts, like a film missing every third\nframe.\nHe was the first one I’d seen since October. On warm autumn nights the\napartment had been full of them, slipping across the ceiling in search of\nmosquitoes. Light startled them; often I’d walk into a room, flip the switch,\nand three or four would fall off the ceiling. They always landed flatly, their\nwebbed feet slapping against the concrete floor. The March lizard was a\nsmall one, and he crept slowly around the doorway and disappeared.\nThe peach trees on Raise the Flag Mountain showed tiny white buds.\nFlowers on campus were beginning to bloom, and every few days we had\nrain. The sand banks and rocky islands in the rivers were steadily shrinking.\nThe White Crane Ridge disappeared.\nFor two days the winter fog faded and the sun shone more brightly than it\nhad in months. I went running in a short-sleeved shirt. Peasants in the fields\nwere wading behind oxen, plowing the mud. Rice-planting season was here.\nAnd then the cold returned as suddenly as it had left. The fog came back\nand settled thick above the rivers. Some of the flowers died. The buds on\nRaise the Flag Mountain paused. The peasants kept plowing. In the stairway\noutside of my apartment, I found a dead lizard, his dusty eyes gray and dull.\nA FEW DAYS LATER I took a long hike up the Wu River. I packed my\ntent and sleeping bag, along with my camping stove. I put a compass in my\npocket. Recently my younger sister Angela had sent me an old paperback\ncopy of Ted Williams’s baseball autobiography, which I brought as well. I\nhoisted the pack onto my shoulders and walked out the side gate of the\ncollege.\nI headed south past the mouth of Mo Pan Valley and up the street through\nthe Taiji medicine factory district. Everybody stopped to stare as I walked\npast; I heard laughter behind me. An old man paused on the side of the road,\nsmiling. “Are you going home?” he asked.\n“Yes,” I said, and I waved to him and kept walking.\nIt was a gray, misty morning, with a cold wind blowing down the Wu",
        "River valley, but it felt good to have a full pack on my shoulders, and it felt\ngood to be walking. I came to the Wu River Great Bridge, where the East\nRiver road swung west across the water, and I crossed the street, taking the\nfootpath that ran above the river. All winter I had looked out my window at\nthe steep green hills and the far bend of the Wu, hazy in the distance, and all\nwinter I had been thinking: Someday in the spring I’ll see what’s beyond that\nbend.\nThe water was a chalky green and I followed the paths along the Wu’s\nwestern bank. I passed the first side valley with its broken Buddhist shrine\ntucked underneath low trees, and I walked through some small farms and\ncame to the Fuling Liangtang ore factory, where they dug gravel out of the\nhills. A pale dust covered everything—the docks, the workers’ dormitories,\nthe massive steel chutes that carried the rocks down from the hills. In the\ncenter of the complex was a sign:\nHappy Happy Go to Work,\nSafe Safe Return Home\nIn Chinese you can double adjectives for emphasis, and that was a\ncommon propaganda message in factories and construction sites. It was\nalways a pretty good indication that you should keep moving. There were lots\nof those signs across the Yangtze River, where they were blasting the hell out\nof the mountains with dynamite to make a new highway to Chongqing.\nThe air in the ore factory tasted like dirt and jackhammers roared steadily.\nWorkers—curious curious, surprised surprised—stared at me as I passed. I\nclimbed the torn hillside above the factory, the dust settling dry in my throat,\nand then the path swung west into another cross valley and I had entered the\ncountryside.\nThe Wu was bordered by high white cliffs of limestone, and crops in the\nlower valley were terraced atop walls of rock. Wheat stood in neat rows,\nnearly ready for harvest, and the hills were sprinkled with the yellow of\nrapeseed coming into season. I walked alongside vegetable plots—radishes,\nonions, purple-flowered broad beans. Down along the valley floor were",
        "farmhouses, mud-walled with tile roofs, and a cow grazed beside a stand of\nbamboo. The noise of the factory was gone; I heard birds chirping, and\noccasionally a rooster crowed. Banana trees stood in the lowlands, their dead\nleaves rustling in the slight breeze.\nI kept the river to my right and followed the paths that looked good as I\nmade my way south. In the wider valleys, the peasants were plowing their\npaddies behind placid water buffalo, and they always stopped in astonishment\nwhen I walked past. The water buffalo stood thoughtfully while the peasants\nasked me where I had come from and where I was going. I had no clear\ndestination in mind, which bothered them; their shouts echoed up through the\nvalley: “Butong! Butong! That path doesn’t go through! Come back!” I\nalways heard the same thing but I kept walking, because one path always led\nto the next peasant home and from there another trail set off through the hills.\nHere the water of the Wu looked even cleaner than in Fuling, a deep dull\ngreen that was torn into white strips by the rapids. The river traffic was light\n—the occasional ferry, a barge every half hour or so, some small sampans\nflitting along the banks. The little boats bumped over the rapids and then\nsettled calm in the deep water.\nBy noon I could feel a rhythm developing—the steady footsteps, the even\nswing of my pack—and I wondered what it would be like to keep going, to\nwalk south into Guizhou and beyond, watching the hills change and listening\nto the accents become less and less intelligible. Even here it was difficult to\ncommunicate with the people; their dialect was much stronger than in the city\nand usually they were overcome with the shock of seeing a waiguoren. It was\nhard to ask them for directions, because they always believed that I was\nhopelessly lost and they wanted to help me catch a boat back to Fuling. But I\nsmiled and thanked them, heading off southward while their warnings rang in\nmy ears.\nSometimes the white cliffs rose too steeply and I detoured away from the\nriver, and then I used my compass and kept an eye on the deep airspace\nabove the Wu. You could see it from miles away, because the hills fell away\nsuddenly at the edge of the river valley, leaving an emptiness that hung like a\nshadow across the sky. And so even when the water was out of sight I\nfollowed the Wu’s reflection along the horizon as it twisted south.\nIn late afternoon the sun shined weakly through the fog as I made my\nway down a steep path toward the banks of the river. I had no idea how far",
        "I’d gone—perhaps twelve miles, maybe fourteen. I met four people who had\njust returned on the last boat from Fuling, and they warned me that there\nwouldn’t be another one until early tomorrow morning. I said that was fine.\nThey asked where I had come from, and I told them I was an American\nteacher who worked in the city.\n“How much money do you make?” asked a young man. He was dressed\nin a new sweater and he had just done some shopping in the city. His was a\ncommon question and I answered it truthfully, as I always did. I made one\nthousand yuan a month, which was almost 120 American dollars.\n“Wah!” he said. “That’s not enough! A waiguoren should make more\nthan that! Why don’t you find another job?”\nEverybody told me that wherever I went. One of the difficult aspects of\nbeing a Peace Corps volunteer was that the locals often thought you were a\nfool for accepting such low wages. The man shook his head and then his\ngirlfriend stepped forward shyly, asking why I had come to this part of the\ncountry.\n“It’s spring and I like walking,” I said. “And in Fuling I have no work to\ndo.”\nThis was even more ridiculous than my salary and they shook their heads.\n“You carry too many things,” the woman said, tugging at my bag. That was\nalso true and I was happy to see that the people in this remote place were as\nsensible as the ones I knew in Fuling. They waved goodbye and headed up\nthe path, and I walked down through a narrow gorge to the Wu.\nNobody else was down by the water. It was rocky along the bank, with a\nbig slab of limestone where the docking ferries had worn a deep square\ngroove. Higher up there was a grassy spot overlooking the river. I pitched my\ntent there and it was a good place for sleeping. There were no houses nearby\nand the cliffs rose sheer into the mist.\nI sat on a rock at the water’s edge, watching the river. I took out Ted\nWilliams’s book and started reading:\nI wanted to be the greatest hitter who ever lived. A man has to have\nhis goals—for a day, for a lifetime—and that was mine, to have people\nsay, “There goes Ted Williams, the greatest hitter who ever lived.”\nCertainly nobody ever worked harder at it. It was the center of my heart,",
        "hitting a baseball.\nIt was a good book to read at the end of March on the banks of the Wu\nRiver. I finished half of it there on the rock, and then the mist grew heavier\nand the temperature dropped. A sampan drifted past and I sat motionless, so\nthe passengers couldn’t see me in the growing darkness. They were husband\nand wife, like so many of the pairs that worked the small fishing boats. The\nwoman stood sculling in the stern with the long oar while her husband\nworked the nets at the prow. They did not speak to each other. I wondered\nwhat that would be like, to be married to somebody and spend all day\nworking together on a boat that was fifteen feet long. The couple on the\nsampan seemed to be handling it all right. They worked skillfully and all I\ncould hear was the soft slipping sound of the oar and the quiet splashing as\nthe man pulled the nets on board. It was too dark to see if they had had any\nluck. They drifted out of sight around the bend, heading downstream.\nThe rain started softly and I found a rock overhang that kept my stove\ndry. I arranged everything carefully and boiled the rest of the water I had\nbeen carrying. I cooked oatmeal and then noodles, and after eating I turned\noff the stove so the water would cool. Some of it I poured into my bottle and\nthe rest I left to clean the bowls.\nThe rain was falling harder now and I made sure that the tent was\nsatisfactory. I laid out my sleeping bag, and I put all of my gear inside the\ntent, checking the lines and stakes. Everything was fine. In Switzerland I had\nonce camped in that tent for two months, and ever since that summer there\nwas a specific way in which everything had to be done.\nThe water on the stove cooled and I used it to clean up. I thought about\nTed Williams and wondered how he would like Sichuan. Probably not very\nwell; he had fought on the wrong side in the War of Resistance Against the\nAmericans and in Support of the Koreans, and during that war his plane had\nbeen shot down. But he was a hell of a good fisherman and maybe the Wu\nRiver would appeal to that. It wasn’t a bad place to be a waiguoren once you\nwere accustomed to things.\nThe rain came down hard after I got in the tent. I could hear the river\nrunning fast over the rocks. In the morning a rusted boat pulled up to the\nbank and for three yuan I rode it back to the East River dock. That was my",
        "first spring in Fuling.",
        "WHITE FLAT MOUNTAIN\nPAULOWNIA TREES BLOOM PURPLE AND WHITE along the lower\nslopes of White Flat Mountain. The trees’ flowers are short-lived—next week\nthey will begin to wither and fade—and the soft yellow of the rapeseed will\nsoon be cut down from the hills. After that, the bright green ricebeds will\ndisappear, moved and dispersed into the waiting muck of the paddies. Spring\nin Fuling does not arrive so much as it rushes through, a blur of changing\ncolors.\nToday is April 5, Qing Ming, the Day of Pure Brightness. He Zhonggui\nand his family are taking the ferry across the Yangtze to White Flat\nMountain. They are well dressed: the children in new clothes, the women in\nhigh heels, He Zhonggui in a checkered sports coat and a red paisley tie.\nThey stand out from the other passengers, most of whom are peasants\nreturning from market with empty rattan baskets and blue pockets full of\nmoney.\nHe Zhonggui’s parents were from peasant families on the mountain, and\nas a child he spent much time there, but now he rarely returns. He is the\nowner of a Fuling construction company, and there is little building to be\ndone on the steep slopes of White Flat Mountain. But his parents are buried\nthere, and the Day of Pure Brightness is a Chinese holiday of remembrance,\nof visits to rural graves in places like White Flat Mountain, where stone\ntombs stare silent and unblinking at the river valley and its breathless spring.\nHe Zhonggui is accompanied by a clan of fifteen people—aunts and\nuncles, cousins and nieces and nephews, ranging from old women in their\nsixties to a baby of fifteen months. The group disembarks on the northern\nbank and makes its way eastward along the Yangtze’s rocky shore.\nSomewhere in the middle of the clan is Dai Mei, He Zhonggui’s fourteen-\nyear-old niece. She is a talker—a bundle of energy in brown corduroy\noveralls and short bobbed hair, chatting constantly as she bounces from stone",
        "to stone.\nA few miles downstream, a slender white pagoda rises above the horizon,\nits distant shape shadowy and bright like a mirage in the late-morning mist.\n“Do you know why they built those?” Dai Mei asks. “They believed that a\ndragon was there, under the earth, and they believed that if they built the\npagoda he would stay there. But if it ever falls down, the dragon will come\nout.”\nShe pauses, looks up the hill, flicks her glossy black hair, and, like\nfourteen-year-old girls the world over, changes the topic with mind-numbing\nfluency. “My grandparents’ tombs are up there. Some of the peasants are\nburied down here on the lower part, but most are up high. They wanted a\nplace with good fengshui, and they thought it was better higher up. They\nchose the spots themselves. Often they asked a Daoist priest to help, and the\npriest told them whether a place had good fengshui or not. In fact, the priest\nonly cheated them—it’s just superstition. But even today many of the\npeasants still believe in fengshui, just like everybody used to. Our generation,\nthough, doesn’t believe in this kind of thing. We know it’s jiade, fake—it’s\nonly superstition. We believe in science, and we say things like that are\nfeudal ideas.”\nLike many young Chinese, whose instinctive rejection of all things\ntraditional has been more than amply complemented by school lessons, she\nuses “feudal” the way an American child would use “backward.” One of her\ncommon refrains is that China is “too feudal,” and on another occasion she\ncomplains vehemently about the older generation: “People in our China,\nespecially people in their sixties and seventies, are very, very, very feudal! If\nyou want to wear a short skirt, or a blouse that’s like this on your shoulders,\nthey’ll say it’s not proper. My mother isn’t feudal—she wears short skirts,\ntoo, because she looks very young. But my father is very, very, very feudal!\nWe call people like that Lao Fengjian—Old Feudal.”\nToday she keeps such ideas to herself. She says that she has no faith in\nfengshui or Buddhism, but she shrugs. “On a day like the Day of Pure\nBrightness,” she says, “we’ll do things the way our parents and the older\npeople want us to do them. We’ll go to our grandparents’ tombs and pray and\nburn incense, and we’ll act like we believe in all of it. But in our hearts we\ndon’t believe.”",
        "FIREWORKS EXPLODE ON THE SUMMIT, the sound echoing back\nand forth across the river valley, and the family slowly climbs the slope of\nWhite Flat Mountain. They follow narrow switchbacks of rough stone steps;\nthe pace slows; their breath comes in gasps. This is by far the steepest\nmountain in the Fuling area, and the only one that is actually something more\nthan a hill—even Raise the Flag Mountain, with its staircases of rice paddies\nand crop terraces, is too gradual to be considered a true mountain.\nMost of the south face of White Flat Mountain is too steep for terracing,\nand pines grow thick along its summit, above a rocky wall that falls away\nsheer for more than a hundred feet. This limestone cliff is possibly the origin\nof the mountain’s name—although, like so many other names in this part of\nSichuan, the truth has been lost in the past. Indeed, many locals say that the\nname is actually North Flat Mountain. In the local dialect both “white” and\n“north” are pronounced the same way—bei—and the confusion is heightened\nby some Fuling maps using “North Flat Mountain” while others refer to\n“White Flat Mountain.” In a region where literacy has only recently become\ncommon, names were spoken long before they were written down, and in the\nend the spoken word is still all that matters. You pronounce it bei.\nThe family climbs to the east of the cliff wall, where the slope is more\ngradual, and after thirty minutes they come to the home of He Zhonggui’s\ncousin. He is a peasant who lives above the mountain’s initial rise, and\neverybody stops to rest here on the edge of his threshing platform, in the\nshade of the farmhouse’s tiled eaves. For peasants, the threshing platform is\nthe center of home life—this is where grain is threshed, spices are dried,\nvegetables are cut, grandchildren are raised, visitors are served tea. And this\nparticular platform, perched high above the river, has a view whose\nmagnificence quiets today’s guests.\nBelow them is spread all the mountain’s layered scenery, with all its\ntextures and colors: the green terraced fields of wheat, split into neat rows;\nthe plots of rapeseed, their buds a wild tangle of yellow glory; the soft-\nflowered paulownias, rising above gray-roofed houses; the great Yangtze\nglinting silver in the sun; and, across the river, the hazy pagoda shimmering\nslender and white in the distance. A light breeze brushes the nearby rows of\nyoung wheat. The temperature in the shade is perfect.",
        "The peasant and his wife serve tea. The guests chat; the breeze blows.\nThe tea cools. After a polite amount of time has been spent, the clan files out\nbehind the house to the back fields, past a massive old tomb.\nNobody knows the name of the family that is buried here. “Qing\nDynasty,” the locals say, when asked when the tomb was built. But in Fuling\nthis is the standard response to almost any question about old tombs, ancient\nhouses, or other relics whose origins have been lost in the rush of the last\ncentury. “Qing Dynasty,” the people always say knowingly. They realize it’s\na safe guess—the Qing ruled for nearly three centuries, from 1644 to 1911.\nParadise Lost is Qing Dynasty, and the American Revolution is Qing\nDynasty, and the most recent Chicago Cubs World Championship is Qing\nDynasty. When people in Fuling say Qing Dynasty, often what they seem to\nmean is: It’s very old, but not as old as many other things.\nThey know that this is a landlord’s tomb, because it is easily five times\nthe size of the other graves in the area. The tomb is fifteen feet high, set into\nthe side of the mountain, and nine rows of corn have been planted on its\nearth-covered back. Nearby, a dark stand of bamboo rustles and creaks in the\nwind. Stone carvings decorate the tomb’s face, and several figures have had\ntheir heads knocked off—vandalism, perhaps from the Cultural Revolution.\nAnd maybe this was also when the family name was removed. But most of\nthe stone face is remarkably intact, and an inscription reads, in part:\nMay the orchids and laurels give sweetness to your heart\nMay your descendants find success\nAnd may your soul be at peace.\nLooking at such a tomb, one can only imagine the typical fate of a\nlandlord’s descendants: the post-Liberation executions, exiles, struggle\nsessions, reeducation camps. Probably the scions of this landlord did not find\nthe success he imagined—but this is only a guess. All that is certain is that\nthe tomb has no name, and here in the bamboo’s shade there are no orchids,\nand today on the Day of Pure Brightness there are no descendants paying\ntheir respects. Nearby, the family chatter as they offer paper money at the\ngraves of He Zhonggui’s father and uncle. But this massive tomb has no",
        "offerings other than the young corn along its back, and all is silent except for\nthe mysterious devotion of the wind among the creaking stalks of bamboo.\nHE ZHONGGUI’S FATHER AND UNCLE are buried side by side, a pair\nof solid limestone tombs facing south and east toward the Yangtze and the\nworld beyond. The visitors have walked single-file through wheat fields to\nthe graves, careful not to trample the young green stalks, and now they light\nfat red candles and burn piles of paper money.\nThe bills, which are in denominations of $800 million, say “Bank of\nHeaven” on the front. They are legal tender in the next world. The money\ncrumples into black balls of ash as the fire flickers and gasps. The candles\ndance in the Yangtze wind. Waves of heat come and go as the flames rise and\nfall.\nThe old women kowtow and pray before the burning money. After they\nfinish, the children take their turns, urged on by their elders. They giggle and\nsloppily kowtow three times, kneeling on strips of paper so their trousers and\ndresses won’t get dirty, and then they close their eyes and pray, sometimes\naloud. “Please help me do well on my examinations,” murmurs Dai Mei’s\ncousin, a sixteen-year-old boy in glasses.\nAfterward, the group files back through the wheat, but three young men\nstay behind. For most of the ritual they have hung back, tolerant but cool and\nuninterested; they are in their twenties, and the Day of Pure Brightness is not\na young man’s holiday. But now they clamber up and stand on the graves,\nholding cigarettes and long strands of fireworks, and then they light the fuses.\nGhosts and evil spirits scatter as the fireworks explode. The children clap\nand scream; the old people hold their ears and turn away. The young men\nremain calm—the fireworks erupt in a deafening roar, but each man holds the\nexploding string in hand until the flame leaps nearly to his fingers, and then,\nnonchalantly, he drops the strand and lights another. They do not plug their\nears. They do not laugh or grimace. They make no expression at all;\noutwardly they are completely cool. But something in their eyes cannot be\ncontrolled, flashing with the sheer exhilaration of standing on the tomb while\nall the scenes and sounds of the holiday suddenly converge on this spot: the\nthrobbing explosions, the heavy smell of gunpowder, the swirling dust and"

      "text": "myself sitting in this cadre’s office, bored to tears while he said, slowly,\n“How-are-you?”\n“Mr. Wang has heard that you studied literature,” Dean Fu said. “He\nwants to ask you some questions about American literature.”\nThis took me by surprise. I asked him what he meant.\n“Mr. Wang is the editor of the college literary magazine,” said Dean Fu.\n“He has more than ten thousand books.”\nHe paused to let the number sink in. Then he leaned forward and spoke in\na low voice. “Mr. Wang,” he said, “has the most books of anybody in Fuling\nTeachers College.”\nA proud smile flickered across Teacher Wang’s face and I could see that\nhe understood what had been said. I wondered if Sichuanese men had book\nrankings as well as alcohol rankings, and what the relationship might be\nbetween these two sources of prestige. This was all uncharted territory—in\nPeace Corps training nobody had warned us about books.\nI said that I knew less about American literature than English literature,\nbut I’d try to answer his questions. Teacher Wang nodded and shot off his\nfirst query in Chinese to Dean Fu, who translated.\n“Mr. Wang has a question about Saul Bellow,” he announced. “Does the\naverage American understand his books?”\nI said that I had read very little of Bellow’s work, but my impression was\nthat his style was accessible, and that he was considered one of the best\nJewish American writers and a voice of Chicago. Teacher Wang nodded, as if\nthis was what he had expected to hear. He had another question ready.\n“What about Joyce Carol Oates?” Dean Fu said. “Do you think that she\nfollows in the tradition of Virginia Woolf?”\n“Not really,” I said. “Most people say that Joyce Carol Oates isn’t a\nfeminist writer. Actually, some feminists criticize her.”\nThis led us to a discussion on feminism, followed by Toni Morrison and\nblack women writers, and then we came to southern literature. After that we\ntalked about Hemingway and the “Dirty Realism” of authors like Raymond\nCarver and Tobias Wolff. All of it was translated through Dean Fu, and as we\ntalked I realized that he had an even more impressive knowledge of American\nliterature than I had thought. I also realized that I was a jackass for assuming\nthat the ten-thousand-book Teacher Wang needed my help to say “How-are-\nyou.”\n\nAfter half an hour we moved to the banquet hall. The first toast was a\ngeneral one, for everybody at the table, and then Teacher Wang gave Adam\nand me a special toast. Party Secretary Zhang followed with another shot for\nthe entire party. When the next toast came around, Teacher Sai pushed his\ncup away and grinned nervously.\n“I can’t drink any more,” he said. “That is enough.”\n“Drink it,” said Party Secretary Zhang. “All of it.”\n“You know that I do not drink,” Teacher Sai said. He brought his hands\ntogether and bowed his head quickly in a pleading gesture. Teacher Sai was\none of the brightest of the department teachers, a pudgy man in his forties\nwho was always smiling. Tonight his face was already bright red after two\nshots. He shook his head again.\n“No, no, no,” said Party Secretary Zhang. “You must do it for our\nguests.”\n“I can’t.”\nThey were speaking English for our benefit, but then they shifted to\nChinese. While arguing they fought over the cup—Teacher Sai tried to push\nit away while Party Secretary Zhang held it firmly on the table. Dean Fu and\nTeacher Wang grinned. They joined in, scoffing at Teacher Sai until at last he\npicked up the shot glass. Everybody watched.\nIt took him a long time to drain the cup. He drank it in three painful sips,\nand after the last one he gasped and coughed. He put the cup back down on\nthe table. Within seconds the waitress was there to refill it. Teacher Sai\nquickly put his hand over the cup, shaking his head.\n“That is enough,” he said.\nParty Secretary Zhang tried to pry Teacher Sai’s hand away. The waitress\nstood by patiently, bottle in hand. It was a quintessentially Sichuanese scene\n—for every scroll painting of a lovely river they could have had ten depicting\nbaijiu arguments, two men scrabbling over a cup while a young woman\nwaited with a bottle.\n“Seriously,” Teacher Sai said. “That is enough for me.”\n“Miss Sai,” taunted Party Secretary Zhang, pulling at his hand.\n“Miss Sai,” echoed Dean Fu, grinning.\nTeacher Wang said something and everybody laughed. For a few minutes\nthe entire table was focused on Teacher Sai’s cup. It was hard to believe that\nless than an hour ago we had been talking about Saul Bellow and Joyce Carol\n\nOates. Finally Teacher Sai relented.\n“Only one more,” he said. “This is the last one.”\nThe waitress filled his cup. Teacher Wang smiled and turned his attention\ntoward Adam and me. He made a quick gesture, holding up his cup, and the\nthree of us drank. Teacher Wang downed the baijiu easily and he was not\nturning red.\nThe food came and for a while the shots slowed. When they resumed,\neverybody had forgotten about Teacher Sai, who was only good\nentertainment at the start and finish of a banquet. He was too much hassle\nonce the serious drinking started and now he sat sipping tea while the baijiu\nflowed in earnest.\nThere was strategy to this part of the banquet and usually the shots were\npreceded by low murmurings, the teachers speaking the Sichuan dialect while\nAdam and I muttered English back and forth. The trick was to get a two-for-\none—if Party Secretary Zhang toasted both Adam and me, then we would\nboth drink and immediately afterward Dean Fu could do the same. Our\nresponse was to hit them with a preemptive strike; if we sensed that they\nwere plotting, one of us would toast the pair, or the entire table, and then they\nwould have to recover before resuming the attack. Occasionally they tried to\nfocus on me, sensing weakness, but when that happened Adam would step in\nand cover me. That was acceptable in Sichuan—a friend could take a shot for\nyou. Sichuanese drinking was a lot like war.\nEvery banquet had a leader, a sort of alcoholic alpha male who controlled\nthe direction of the baijiu. Party Secretary Zhang always led the English-\ndepartment events, but tonight he deferred to Teacher Wang. The big man\nworked quickly and with surprising fairness, toasting the entire table until the\nother teachers started to weaken. After that he focused on Adam and me,\nscorning the usual two-for-one as he traded personal shots between the two of\nus. It was a remarkable exhibition. After half an hour the three of us were still\nthe most sober at the table, but I was fading quickly and Teacher Wang\nshowed no signs of slowing. I heard Dean Fu and Party Secretary Zhang\nasking him to ease up, because they were afraid I would get sick, and at last\nthe flurry of toasts ended.\nTeacher Wang began to tell a long story. It was about a pedicab and he\ntold it in Sichuanese while Teacher Sai translated. The story moved slowly\nand I was too drunk to listen carefully. My gaze wandered across the table\n\nuntil I found myself looking at the little man who had come with Teacher\nWang. I had forgotten entirely about him and now he smiled. He said\nsomething, but I couldn’t understand; he was a dialect speaker and in any\ncase the baijiu had not improved either of our language abilities. Finally he\nconcentrated very hard, pronouncing four Mandarin syllables clearly.\n“Sha shi bi ya,” he said.\n“I’m sorry,” I said in Chinese. “What did you say?”\n“Sha shi bi ya.”\nI shook my head and he repeated it a few more times, gesturing as if he\nwere reading a book. Finally something clicked in my mind.\n“Shakespeare?” I said.\nHe laughed and gave me the thumbs up. “Di gen si.”\n“Dickens?”\nHe nodded and laughed again.\n“Ma ke tu wen.”\n“Mark Twain.”\nSlowly we made our way through Melville, Norris, O’Connor, and\nCheever. It took me a long time to guess Norris and Cheever. There wasn’t\nanything else that we were able to talk about and I never learned the little\nman’s name, although he was able to communicate that he especially liked\nthe Norris novel McTeague, which is perhaps the only great American novel\nabout a dentist. Nowadays hardly anybody in America reads Norris but there\nwas at least one fan along the Upper Yangtze.\nTeacher Wang finished with the pedicab story. Even though I had missed\nmost of it I could gather that it was about a time when he was very drunk and\nspent half an hour negotiating with a pedicab, only to realize that he was\nalready in front of his hotel. All of the men laughed at the story. Listening to\nits translation reminded them that Teacher Sai was still there.\n“Drink,” said Party Secretary Zhang, pointing at Teacher Sai’s cup.\n“I can’t.”\n“Drink.”\n“I can’t.”\n“Yes.”\n“No.”\n“Drink.”\n“I’m sorry.”\n\n“Miss Sai!”\n“Miss Sai!”\nFinally he shuddered through another shot. It was clear that the banquet\nwas breaking up, and Teacher Wang held his cup up to Adam and me. We\nraised our glasses.\n“To books,” I said.\nBut Teacher Wang had something else in mind. He spoke to me,\nseriously now, and Teacher Sai translated.\n“Mr. Wang,” he said, “wants you to write something for the college\nmagazine.”\nOur cups were frozen above the table.\n“What do you mean?”\n“He wants you to write an article about literature.”\n“American or English? And how long?”\nThey discussed this quickly. Our three cups were still in midair; it was\nwithout question the most favorable instant for a request.\n“American is better,” said Teacher Sai. “Only about ten thousand words.”\nI caught my breath. “I don’t know American literature well enough for\nthat,” I said. “Tell him I can do either Elizabethan poetry or Charles Dickens,\nbecause that’s what I studied at Oxford. Or Shakespeare. But otherwise it\nwould be difficult. I don’t have many notes here.”\nThere was another discussion. My arm was growing heavy. Teacher\nWang nodded.\n“Dickens,” said Teacher Sai. “Ten thousand words.”\nWe drank the shot. The baijiu was starting to taste dangerously foul and I\nshuddered after it was down. A good banquet was like a good short story:\nthere was always a point, but you didn’t quite understand it until the very\nend. Now I realized why we had been invited tonight, but I wasn’t resentful;\nat least now I knew how a Sichuanese literary journal recruited new material.\nThe table bullied Teacher Sai for a few more minutes and then all of us\nstaggered out.\nI HOPED THAT EVERYBODY would forget about the promised essay,\nbut within a week the quiet reminders started. I delayed, explaining that I was\n\nbusy with teaching, but then I began to receive messages about Teacher\nWang’s impending deadline. Finally I sat down and wrote what he wanted,\nwhich was an essay about Dickens’ relationship to political reform.\nI wrote it as quickly as possible. I argued that Dickens was essentially a\nmiddle-class figure who liked writing about social problems not because he\nwanted revolutionary change, but rather because these subjects made for\ngood creative material. I knew the Marxists wouldn’t like this approach, so I\nadded a line that accused Dickens of being a Capitalist Roader. I liked being\nable to use that term in a literary essay. Otherwise the article was not very\nenjoyable to write, and I loaded the descriptions in order to jack up the word\ncount. Teacher Sai had to translate it into Chinese. For a solid week he\nstruggled with the damn thing, coming into my office with questions about\nmy inflated prose, holding his head in his hands.\nON THE SECOND DAY of January, the city of Fuling held a road race in\nthe center of town. It was the Twenty-second Annual Long Race to Welcome\nSpring, and all of the city’s schools and danwei, or work units, competed\nagainst each other. Two weeks before the race, Dean Fu asked if I would run\non the college team. He was obviously nervous, because it hadn’t been long\nsince the problems of the faculty basketball tournament.\n“You must understand,” he said, smiling uncomfortably. “There will be\nmany peasants and uneducated people. They don’t know anything about\nsportsmanship, and perhaps some of them will be rough. Also, in twenty-one\nyears they have never had a foreigner in the long race. They welcome you to\nparticipate, but I think it will be different from in America.”\nI could see that Dean Fu thought it would be simpler if I didn’t run, and I\nknew he was right. For a while I considered not taking part, because the\nbasketball tournament had been a low point in an otherwise good semester.\nAll of the difficult parts of my life were already public; there wasn’t any\nreason to seek out more crowds.\nBut there are no referees in running, and it is not a contact sport. There\nwould be crowds but I figured that at least I would be moving. It couldn’t be\nmuch different from a race in America—and even if it was, I was curious to\nsee what it was like, at least once. I told Dean Fu that I wanted to participate.\n\nHe explained that every runner had to have a physical exam, and a week\nbefore the race I visited a doctor in the college infirmary. It was a low tile-\nroofed building next to the croquet court, one of the old structures on campus\nthat remained from the pre-Cultural Revolution days when the college had\nbeen a high school.\nThe doctor checked my pulse and blood pressure. After each test he\nsmiled and told me that I was very healthy, and I thanked him. Then he led\nme to a side room where a dirty white box-shaped instrument hung on the\nwall. Dean Fu said, “Now you will have a chest X ray.”\nI stopped at the entrance to the room. “I don’t want to have a chest X\nray,” I said.\n“It’s no problem,” said Dean Fu, smiling. “It’s very safe.”\n“I don’t want a chest X ray,” I said again, and I looked at the dirty box\nand thought: Especially I don’t want this chest X ray. “Why is it necessary?”\n“Everybody in the race must have one. To make sure they are healthy.”\n“Everybody?” I asked, and he nodded. I asked how many people would\nbe running.\n“More than two thousand and five hundred.”\n“And all of them must have a chest X ray before they can run?”\n“Yes,” he said. “That is the rule. It is very safe.”\nIt struck me as a ludicrous notion—that a city with a per capita income of\nabout forty American dollars a month would require a chest X ray from each\nof the 2,500 participants in a four-kilometer road race. I had my suspicions\nabout what was really happening: some administrator in the college was\nprobably worried about me dropping dead in the middle of the race, and they\nwanted to cover their tracks. It was always Dean Fu’s job to convey such\ncommands to the waiguoren, and occasionally he served as a filter as much\nas a translator. It was a lousy job and I always felt sorry for him when I\nsensed that this was happening, but there was nothing to do about it except\ntry to find a tactful solution.\nWe were at an impasse. Dean Fu could see that I was serious about\nrefusing to have an X ray, and I knew that he couldn’t simply back down and\nsay that the procedure wasn’t in fact required. We stood there for a moment,\nthe doctor watching expectantly. Finally I told Dean Fu that I would go to my\napartment and call the Peace Corps office in Chengdu.\nI tried to call but the medical officer wasn’t in. I sat in my bedroom for\n\nten minutes, reading a book, and then I returned to the infirmary.\n“I’m very sorry,” I said, “but the Peace Corps told me I can’t have a chest\nX ray. I don’t know what we can do about this.”\n“It’s no problem,” Dean Fu said. “I just talked to some of the people in\ncharge of the race, and they said it is fine if you do not have an X ray. They\nwill give you an exception because you are a foreigner.”\nI thanked him and apologized for the hassle, and he apologized back.\nBoth of us shook the doctor’s hand. He walked us to the door, smiling and\nwaving as we left.\nTHERE WAS NO SCHEDULED TIME for the race to start. The runners\nassembled in a disorderly mob at the starting area, and at nine o’clock the\ncadres began their speeches. The race would begin whenever the speeches\nfinished, and the officials droned on and on while the starting line repeatedly\nbroke and surged. A small section would make a false start and the rest of the\ncrowd would react, and then the police would call everybody back. I tried to\njog in place to stay warm, fighting with my elbows to keep position.\nThe starting line was spread across a massive construction site where a\nnew public park was being built. The entire left side of the line headed\ndirectly toward a six-foot drop—a small, crumbling cliff. On the far right was\na narrow dirt road that provided the only safe exit for the runners, but it was\nso close to the start—less than forty yards—that it would be impossible for\nthe crowd to funnel in such a short distance. And even for the runners who\ndid make it safely, the course immediately took a ninety-degree turn that\nwould claim more victims.\nWithout question it was the most dangerous starting arrangement I had\never seen in a lifetime of racing. I was tempted to pull out, partly for my\nsafety but mostly because I wanted to be able to watch the disaster from the\nperspective of a spectator. Rob Schmitz, another Peace Corps volunteer, was\nvisiting us that week, and he and Adam took their cameras and gleefully\nwaited across the road.\nThe college team had staked out a spot on the right side of the line,\ndirectly in front of the exit. Most of them were physical education students,\nand usually we were the best team in the race, along with the Taiji medicine\n\nfactory. All of us squeezed together, waiting for the start. It was a cool\nmorning and the winter smog hung low over the city.\nFive minutes passed, then ten. The cadres kept talking, and the police\nwere having trouble holding everybody back. Either they were going to start\nthe race or it was going to start itself, and finally one of the cadres must have\nrealized this. He fired the gun.\nIt was China. Chaos, noise, adrenaline; fear and surprise and excitement;\na mass of bodies, everybody yelling, horns sounding, the earth pounding; all\nof us running madly, arms outstretched to clear room; legs pumping, dashing,\nsprinting, trying to keep the back kick low to avoid being tripped; some\nrunners shouting as they stumbled over the cliff, others skidding around the\nfirst turn, dodging the few unfortunate ones who fell and skidded below the\nrush of legs. The seconds slid past, each moment an eternity of concentration\nand effort. We flew down the street in a wild charging mob, hit the second\nturn, and headed west on Xinghua Road.\nThe course began to climb uphill. The scene was still shaky with\nadrenaline but I realized that the eternity of the start was over, and that I was\nno longer a part of the starting mob. After the beginning of a race there is\nalways that moment of disengagement, when the euphoria of being a part of\nsomething massive is over and you realize that you are alone, and that you\nhave your own race to run.\nI slowed down. Suddenly I felt tired; the adrenaline evaporated and\neverything slipped into focus. I checked myself—no scrapes, no bruises; no\nmemory of exactly how I had made it safely off the line. I glanced around\nme. I was in the lead pack, a group of perhaps fifty, and the others were also\nsettling in after the rush of the start. We were climbing steadily now and the\npace was slowing. I felt my legs come back to me, the numb excitement\nreplaced by the rhythm of a long hard run—steady steady steady steady, up\non my toes as the hill steepened. Police cars rolled their lights in front of the\npack. Far ahead, groups of school kids were trying to cheat, jumping into the\nrace with a lead of a hundred yards, but the cops pulled them out as they\ndrove past.\nThe entire first half was uphill, and by the time I took the lead, perhaps\ntwo minutes into the race, I could see that the others were finished. It was a\nvaried field—college students and danwei workers and a few athletes who\nclearly could have been good runners with more training—but all of them\n\nwere done. Quickly I slipped ahead.\nTo lead any big race is a strange feeling. People speak of the loneliness of\nrunning, but I’ve always felt that the sport is lonely only in the races, and\nespecially when the pack breaks and you find yourself alone in front. In the\npack you usually feel some solidarity with the other athletes, even though you\nare still competing, but in front there are no illusions. That’s when the race\nbecomes a chase—one man against the rest of the field—and I’ve always felt\nthat this is the loneliest feeling in the world. And it’s even lonelier when you\nare the only foreigner in a field of more than two thousand, and all along the\ncourse spectators are calling out “Waiguoren, waiguoren, waiguoren.” Out-\nof-country person, out-of-country person, out-of-country person.\nI looked back. Behind me I could see the rest of the field—an endless\nstream of people, a black-haired mob. The main pace car had slowed and I\nwas following a few strides behind its flashing lights. I looked back again, so\nI would remember the strangeness of the scene. The hill was steep now,\nclimbing toward the pointed tower of the Monument to the Revolutionary\nMartyrs. The street was lined with spectators and I could hear the wave of\nsurprise as I passed; they were talking excitedly and exclaiming with\namazement. “Waiguoren, waiguoren, waiguoren.”\nAnd I thought: Not today. If you’re looking for people who are out of\ntheir country, out of place, out of step, out of shape, awkward, clumsy; if\nthat’s what you’re looking for, look back there. Look for the ones who started\ntoo fast, or the men who have smoked too many Magnificent Sound\ncigarettes, or the people who are wearing too many clothes and are choking\nwith heat and sweat. Don’t look at me—I’ve done this for many years in\nmany places, and always it has been exactly the same. There are no referees,\nno language barriers, no complicated rules of etiquette. All you do is run.\nBy the turnaround I had more than thirty seconds on the next runner, and\nI took it easy from there. The second half was all downhill, and because it\nwas an out-and-back course I passed the rest of the field. The ones who\nweren’t too exhausted joined in the chorus: “Waiguoren, waiguoren,\nwaiguoren.” But it didn’t bother me a bit, because for those four kilometers I\nfelt completely at home.\n\nFOR THE VICTORY I won two pairs of polyester sports uniforms, both\ntoo small, with the characters for Fuling City inscribed proudly on the chest. I\nalso received a certificate testifying that “Comrade He Wei,” my Chinese\nname, had won the Twenty-second Annual Long Race to Welcome Spring.\nThe race organizers awarded me twenty yuan, and the college gave me five\nfor participating on its team. They also gave me one and a half yuan for\nundergoing the medical exam, which made me wonder how much I could\nhave made if I had agreed to the chest X ray. All told I cleared twenty-six and\na half yuan, which paid for two weeks of noodle lunches.\nI was on the local TV news for the following week, and the next day’s\npaper featured a front-page story about the race. They reported that an\nAmerican teacher from Missouri named H.Essler had participated, and there\nwas a detailed description of the way I had warmed up before the start. They\nreported the excitement of the college representatives when I finished in first\nplace, and they quoted one of the other top finishers, a young man from the\nmedicine factory who said, “If this race had been right after my military\ntraining, I definitely would have beaten that foreigner.” The end of the article\nread:\nThe competition also succeeded in establishing patriotism in sports.\nWhen our reporter asked, “What are your thoughts about a waiguoren\nfinishing first,” a Trade School student named Xu Chengbo said: “To\nhave a sports competition in a Chinese area and allow a waiguoren to\ntake first place, I feel very ashamed. This gives us a wakeup call: our\nstudents and adults need to improve the quality of their bodies, because\nif we improve our strength, we can be victorious!”…A Southwest\nMilitary School teacher said: “The waiguoren took the initiative, and\nthat sort of spirit deserves to be studied. Only if we plunge into\ndeveloping our bodies, and have more diligent and scientific training,\nwill we see the day when we achieve the championship!”\nIt wasn’t exactly the reaction I had hoped for, although I wasn’t\nsurprised. There was a great deal of patriotism in Fuling, and sports always\nmade these feelings particularly intense. That was why the basketball had\n\nbeen such a failure, and sometimes I wondered if it had been a bad idea to run\nin the race. A few of my Peace Corps friends thought that at least I shouldn’t\nhave tried to win. But I liked running races hard, just like many others in the\ncompetition, and I saw no reason to treat the people in Fuling like children. I\nwanted them to know that waiguoren were living in their city, and I wanted\nthem to see that despite all my struggles with the language, there was at least\none thing I could do well. If they reacted with shame, that was unfortunate,\nbut perhaps when they grew to know me better it would be different. I figured\nit was a good sign that my certificate read “Comrade He Wei.”\nA few days after the race, I had class with Teacher Liao, who beamed\nwhen we started the lesson.\n“I saw on the department message board that you won the long race in\nFuling!” she said. “I hadn’t heard—why didn’t you tell me?”\n“It’s not important,” I said. “In fact, I didn’t run very fast at all.”\n“Yes, you did!” she said, doubly pleased by my false modesty, which\nfollowed the appropriate Chinese custom. “That’s a very big race—in all of\nFuling City, you are the fastest person!”\n“There are probably better athletes who didn’t participate,” I said. “And\nyou know, Wang Junxia is still faster than me.”\nWang Junxia was the Chinese woman distance runner who had recently\nwon gold and silver medals in the Atlanta Olympics, and this reference made\nTeacher Liao even happier. She praised me again, and finally we settled\ndown to a chapter on how to say goodbye. Either I did unusually well or she\nwas in a particularly forgiving mood; on that day she hardly said budui at all.\n\nTHE WHITE CRANE RIDGE\nTODAY THE YANGTZE RIVER is two inches higher than it was in\nmidwinter 1,234 years ago. The intervening years have witnessed other\nchanges—the passing of five imperial dynasties; the arrival and departure of\nthe Mongols, the Manchus, the British, the Japanese; the construction of the\nGreat Wall and the destruction of the Cultural Revolution; the Great Leap\nForward and the Reform and Opening; the development of the Three Gorges\nDam from a half-formed dream to the biggest building project in China—but\ndespite all of these changes the level of today’s Yangtze is exactly two inches\nhigher than it was in 763. Two inches in 1,234 years.\nThis is the story that is told by the White Crane Ridge, an eighty-yard-\nlong strip of sandstone that sits like a temporary island in Fuling’s harbor. At\nmost the ridge emerges from below the muddy skin of the Yangtze for five\nwinter months, in the heart of the dry season, and the ridge does not appear at\nall if the year is unusually wet. When it does emerge, the sandstone speaks—\ntwenty-two pictures and over 300,000 characters are engraved on its surface.\nAlong the nearly four thousand miles of the Yangtze’s length, there is no\nother place where man has left such a vivid record of the river’s life.\nNobody knows for certain when the ridge was first used in this way, but\nvirtually all of the carvings refer to a pair of stone carp that are engraved at\nthe bobbing waterline of the river. Each fish is nearly two feet long and they\nswim one after the other, heading westward, their bellies forming a line that\nrepresented the low-water mark at the time of their engraving. In the hooked\nmouth of the forward carp is a lotus blossom. These fish were carved\nsometime in the Tang Dynasty before the year 763, which is the date of the\nfirst engraved reference to their appearance. This afternoon, the level of the\nYangtze is just a touch higher than the line of the carp.\nThe original purpose of the fish was practical rather than artistic. Never\nwas the Yangtze more dangerous to boats than in winter, when low water\n\nexposed shoals and crags. Pilots passing Fuling could study the White Crane\nRidge, note the water level in comparison to the twin carp, and predict the\ncondition of the river ahead. The fish swam in place; the river constantly\nfluctuated; the locals understood this relationship and it became part of the\nYangtze’s annual pattern.\nOver the years, other dynasties left their own engravings on the ridge,\nmost of which note the return of the Tang fish. Just above the two carp, a\nNorthern Song Dynasty carving greets their appearance in the year 971: “The\nwater of the river retreats. The stone fish are seen. Next year there will be a\nbumper harvest.” Ten feet higher on the ridge, time suddenly leaps three and\na half centuries to 1333, when Yuan Dynasty officials note the Tang carp’s\nreturn: “In Fuling the appearance of the stone fish indicates a great harvest,\nguarding the prefecture for the next year.”\nMost of the carvings follow this ritualized form—the date of the carp’s\nsighting, followed by a harvest prediction, all of which is inscribed in the\nname of the emperor. Central to this ritual was the belief that the appearance\nof these Tang fish was associated with harvests, and eventually the White\nCrane Ridge shifted from a navigational tool into an oracle of the mysterious\nand vital cycles of the natural world. And pinned through these never-ending\ncycles was the straight line of human history, as the representatives of\nemperor after emperor left their marks on the rock.\nThe ridge was only one of dozens of annual signs that were recorded in\nthis way by the emperor. He was the Son of Heaven, a representative of the\nunspeakable forces of nature, and yet the manifestation of these same forces\n—an earthquake, a flood, a famine—could signal that heaven had turned\nagainst a ruler and his dynasty. The emperor embodied what he could not\ncontrol and did not understand. As a result, he sought refuge in ritual, and the\nFuling government officials regularly engraved the stone in the name of their\nruler, despite the broken and weathered paragraphs of old that testified to lost\ndynasties and forgotten emperors. And the springtime rising of the Yangtze,\nthe swollen river sweeping over the characters, gave evidence that there were\nforces the emperor could only watch, and that his glorious titles, like the\ninscriptions, were nothing more than words.\nAnd so it goes with the Yuan. The 1333 inscription speaks optimistically\nof a bumper harvest, but the dynasty is already on the decline, having slipped\nfrom what was the largest empire the world has ever known—the empire of\n\nKublai Khan, the Mongol-ruled China that Marco Polo visited. But by 1333,\nMarco Polo is long gone, and Kublai Khan is dead, and the power of the\nYuan is fading. Their officials carve bravely onto the stone, but the dynasty\nhas only thirty-five more years before the wash of time covers it forever.\nDOCKED ON THE SOUTH SIDE of the White Crane Ridge are three\nsampans. The boats are wood, with arched roofs of bamboo and woven reeds.\nEach roof is less than three feet tall at the highest point, reducing wind drag\nand avoiding a structure that could tip the craft, which has no keel. The boats\nare light and narrow, low-gunneled, with virtually no freeboard, and they are\neasily maneuvered in the river’s current. Their design has not changed greatly\nsince people first began carving on the rock to which the sampans are\ntethered.\nFour women chat in the prow of a boat. All of them wear simple jackets\nof blue, and their clothes, like the boats, are dirty. They are river people who\nlive on their sampans; for most of the year they depend on fishing, but winter\nfish are sluggish and the owners of these crafts spend the season on the ridge.\nThey rely on tourism, using small rowboats to ferry visitors back and forth\nfrom shore.\nToday is a holiday and more than fifty visitors are wandering up and\ndown the sandstone, gazing at the inscriptions. Occasionally they will ask a\nquestion of one of the eight workers stationed on the ridge, who have been\nsent here by the Fuling City Cultural Relics Administration. Two of these\nstaff members have some formal education in archaeology, while the others\nare common workers whose job is to sell snacks, oversee the rowboats, and,\nfor two yuan, take photographs of visitors next to the ridge’s biggest carved\nfish.\nA cold wind runs down the corridor of the river valley, and the workers\nhuddle around their snack table, shivering and drinking hot tea. They watch\nthe Yangtze closely, measuring its level every day. Undoubtedly they dream\nof the river rising, because whenever it covers the carvings they can return to\nthe indoors work of their government office in town. For them, the\nappearance of the stone carp augurs nothing more than long cold days of\nexile out on the river.\n\nTo a certain degree this is appropriate, because a number of inscriptions\nwere made by government officials who for various infractions had been\nexiled to Fuling. It was the sort of place that made for a good punishment—a\nlonely river town far from the heart of the empire, a post where\ncommunications broke down and the civilized world slipped away. One\ncarving was mistakenly made in the name of an emperor who had actually\nalready died. News of his passing had not yet made its way down the\nYangtze, and so local officials didn’t realize that they were the subjects of a\nnew ruler.\nAnd while Fuling sometimes represented the end of a political career, the\nridge is testimony that other pursuits could flourish here. Poetry and\ncalligraphy were the traditional pastimes of the lonely exile, and many of the\nlocal officials left inscriptions that are works of beauty. Toward the western\nedge, four characters are inscribed with particular style: “The River Runs\nForever.” This carving’s exact date is unknown; it was made sometime\nduring the Kuomintang period, in the 1930s or 1940s, and the calligraphy’s\ndistinctive loops and curves are of the “running grass” script style. The last\ncharacter, nian, trails off in a long straight line that points like a dagger at the\nriver below.\nPerhaps the ridge’s most famous calligraphy consists of four large\ncharacters less than twenty feet from the Tang carp. These words are stacked\none on top of the other, and they follow the flowing form of the “running\nhand” style. Moss grows green in the ruts of the inscription, which says,\n“Pillar Rock in Midstream.”\nThe author, Xie Bin, was a celebrated calligrapher in the Fuling area,\nwhere his skills earned him the nickname Sacred Hand. He carved the phrase\nin 1881, during the Qing Dynasty, and the elegant inscription calls to mind\nthat period more than a century ago, when the pillar rock holds steady but\nChina is in trouble. The Opium Wars have been fought and lost; the Great\nTaiping Rebellion has been put down at enormous expense. European powers\ncontrol ports all along the Chinese coast. Government money to modernize\nthe navy is being diverted to build a new pleasure palace for Cixi, the\nEmpress Dowager. Thirteen years from now, the Japanese will invade Korea,\ntaking both the peninsula and southern Manchuria. But the White Crane\nRidge emerges as it always has, and Fuling’s Sacred Hand leaves his graceful\nmark.\n\nA Russian-made hydrofoil streaks past the north side of the rock, heading\ntoward Chongqing. The boat’s wake rises and swamps the lower section of\nthe ridge. Tourists scamper to higher ground, laughing, and the water breaks\nwhite over the characters and engraved fish. Then the waves subside, and the\ncarvings are clear once more, and the river runs the same way it has run\nforever.\n\nCHAPTER FOUR\n\nThe Dam\nI TAUGHT MY WRITING CLASS from a Chinese-published text called A\nHandbook of Writing. Like all of the books we used, its political intent was\nnever understated, and the chapter on “Argumentation” featured a model\nessay entitled “The Three Gorges Project Is Beneficial.”\nIt was a standard five-paragraph essay and the opening section explained\nsome of the risks that had led people to oppose the project: flooded scenery\nand cultural relics, endangered species that might be pushed to extinction, the\nthreat of earthquake, landslide, or war destroying a dam that would hold back\na lake four hundred miles long. “In short,” the second paragraph concluded,\n“the risks of the project may be too great for it to be beneficial.”\nThe next two sentences provided the transition. “Their worries and\nwarnings are well justified,” the essay continued. “But we should not give up\neating for fear of choking.” And the writer went on to describe the benefits—\nmore electricity, improved transportation, better flood control—and\nconcluded by asserting that the Three Gorges Project had more advantages\nthan disadvantages.\nI had some moral qualms about teaching a model persuasive essay whose\ntopic had been banned from public debate in China since 1987—this seemed\na slap in the face to the very notion of argumentation. At worst it was an\nexercise in propaganda, and at best it didn’t seem particularly sporting. But I\nhad nothing else to work with, and the truth was that the essay, apart from its\npolitical agenda, provided a good structural model. My job was to teach the\nstudents how to write such a composition, and so I went ahead and taught it. I\nreckoned there was no sense in giving up eating for fear of choking.\nI was punished by having that transition sentence infect my students’\npapers for the rest of the term. They were accustomed to learning by rote,\nwhich meant that they often followed models to the point of plagiarism. They\nwere also inveterate copiers; it wasn’t uncommon to receive the exact same\n\npaper from two or three students. There wasn’t really a sense of wrong\nassociated with these acts—all through school they had been taught to imitate\nmodels, and copy things, and accept what they were told without question,\nand often that was what they did.\nWhen I told them that the Three Gorges essay was a good model, they\nlistened carefully and adopted its nuances in future work. I assigned\nargumentative essays on whether students should be required to do morning\nexercises, and many of them opened their compositions by describing the\nbenefits of the morning routine. After that was finished, they made their shift:\n“But we should not give up eating for fear of choking.” Even students who\nwere writing on opposite sides of the issue used that same transition. Later I\nassigned an argumentative essay on Hamlet’s character, and they listed his\nshortcomings—indecisiveness, cruelty to Ophelia—and many of them\nseemed like good papers until suddenly that cursed sentence came from\nnowhere and boomed out, “But we should not give up eating for fear of\nchoking.” I came to loathe the phrase, and repeatedly I told them that it was a\nhorrid transition, but it always reappeared. At last I gave up, consoling myself\nby thinking darkly of the day when the river was dammed, and the Yangtze\nwould rise up and carry away all of the Handbooks of Writing and smash\nthem in the dam’s seven-hundred-megawatt turbines.\nThat was only fancy, of course—the new reservoir would cause the river\nto rise, but it wouldn’t climb as high as the teaching building. Some of my\nstudents said it would hardly reach the middle of the East River district, while\nothers said it would flood the entire neighborhood, rising all the way to the\ncollege’s front gates. None of them knew for certain, but they didn’t seem to\ncare. They had been told that the dam was beneficial, and that was enough.\nIN TOWN I KNEW EXACTLY where the waterline of the new Yangtze\nwould be, because there were signs that marked its future rise. One was in the\nold part of Fuling, painted in red on the side of a snack shop. There was\nanother in downtown’s Mid-Mountain Road, which was the second big street\nabove the docks.\nBoth of these signs said the same thing in huge red numbers: “177m.”\nThis figure represented the future water level of the reservoir, which at its\n\nmaximum could be filled to an elevation of 177 meters (581 feet) above sea\nlevel. There were red signs like this in all of the Yangtze settlements, and\nheading downstream the numbers marched steadily up the hillsides, until at\nlast you came to low-lying towns like Wushan, where the signs were so far\nabove the city that nothing would be left once the dam reached full capacity\nin 2009.\nBecause Fuling lies three hundred miles upstream from the dam site, the\nrise of the river here won’t be nearly as dramatic as in places like Wushan.\nBut even in Fuling the red numbers foreshadow what will be a massive\nchange: taking the White Crane Ridge as Fuling’s traditional winter\nbenchmark, the surface of the new reservoir will be more than 130 feet above\nthe Tang Dynasty twin carp.\nSometimes when I was in town I’d stop and watch the 177m signs for a\nfew minutes on an average morning. Outside the snack shop, children would\nbe playing, and stick-stick soldiers would be carrying loads up the steps, and\nthe woman who owned the shop would have a yellow pot of bean curd\nsteaming in her doorway. On Mid-Mountain Road there would be\nunemployed laborers standing with bow saws and paintbrushes, looking for\nwork, and shoeshine men and small-time entrepreneurs would have their\nstands set up next to the sign. Everywhere I looked, it was typical, everyday\nlife; and yet in a decade all of it would be below the level of the new\nreservoir. And by walking downhill I could see just how much more of the\ncity would be affected: the majority of the old town with its buildings of tile\nand wood, and the entire shop district of Mid-Mountain Road and Riverside\nRoad. They were lively parts of the city, and the people always seemed too\nbusy to look twice at those signs. The river wasn’t scheduled to start rising\nuntil 2003, which for the residents of Fuling was a long time away. They had\nother things to worry about.\nThey also had the government’s promise that it would build a dike around\nFuling to protect these low-lying districts. Whenever I asked people about the\nThree Gorges Project, they always shrugged and said that the city was going\nto build a 150-foot-high shuiba, a water-wall, which meant that the new dam\nwouldn’t affect their homes. But the details of this dike seemed awfully\nvague. Would it surround the entire city? When would it be built? If they\nbuilt a 150-foot high wall next to your home, wouldn’t that be awfully dark\nand unpleasant? And what about safety—could you really trust the shuiba?\n\nWhenever I asked these questions, nobody had any answers, and it seemed\nthat none of them entertained such doubts. There was going to be a shuiba—\nthat was all they knew and all that mattered. Even when I left Fuling, in the\nsummer of 1998, construction of the dike hadn’t yet begun, but still I didn’t\nhear of any worries or concerns.\nMostly I heard the advantages of the dam, which followed the three\npoints of my textbook’s essay: electricity, flood control, and transportation.\nThese are important issues for people in a place like Fuling, and with regard\nto all three the new dam will make a substantial difference. By far it will be\nthe largest hydroelectric dam in the world, its wall roughly six times the\nlength of the Hoover Dam’s, and the Three Gorges Dam’s twenty-six\nmassive turbines will produce 18,100 megawatts of electricity—the\nequivalent of ten nuclear reactors, enough energy to boost China’s national\noutput by 10 percent. The Yangtze’s summer floods, which in the past six\ndecades have killed more than 330,000 people, will be better controlled by\nthe dam. In effect, it will turn Chongqing into a seaport, as ten-thousand-ton\nships—three times the size of the current limit—will be able to navigate the\nupper river.\nThis last point was of particular interest to Fuling, because the largest\nships will not be able to go all the way to Chongqing in all seasons. There are\nsome narrow river passages between the two cities, and speculation is that\nFuling will become a major port to serve boats too large to reach Chongqing.\nThis will be a significant change, as Fuling, with its lightly populated Wu\nRiver, has previously played a relatively small role in Sichuan’s\ntransportation network. More important, this new status will end the city’s\nisolation. When I arrived in Fuling, construction had already begun on a\nhigh-speed expressway that would run to Chongqing, and there was talk of\nbuilding a railroad sometime after the year 2000. For the people of Fuling\nthese were long-awaited changes; soon their city would become something\nmore than a forgotten river town, and they would no longer be at the mercy\nof the Yangtze and its slow boats.\nBut at the same time this begged another obvious question: Can one\nreally believe that all of the people along the Yangtze—the boat captains, the\nbusinessmen, the flood-fearing peasants—will no longer be at the mercy of\nthe river? Or will the river still be in control, with the stakes of disaster raised\nby the effort to harness the Yangtze? The dam is being constructed on an\n\nearthquake fault, and the unstable Gorges have a long history of enormous\nlandslides that cause massive waves. And the Yangtze isn’t just water; the\nriver carries a thousand times as much silt as the muddy Mississippi. Cities\nlike Chongqing and Fuling spew their sewage more or less untreated into the\nriver, as well as waste from their factories, and there is speculation that all of\nthis filth and silt will back up behind the dam. A ten-thousand-ton ship won’t\nbe of much use in a four-hundred-mile-long bog.\nFor these and other reasons, the project has long inspired apocalyptic\nvisions from a host of experts, both Chinese and foreign. They envision a\nbroken dam, a silt-filled reservoir; they warn that the rising river will carry\nnew poisons that previously had been stored on its banks. The reservoir will\nflood thirteen cities, 140 towns, and 1,352 villages; it will swamp 650\nfactories and 139 power stations. For more than ten thousand years the river\nvalley has been home to human civilization, and all of man’s endless traces,\nthe garbage dumps and the chemical deposits, will be held stagnant in the\nnew reservoir. And the river isn’t something to be tinkered with lightly—over\n350 million people live in the Yangtze’s watershed, more than in America\nand Canada combined, one person out of every twelve on earth.\nExperts warn that mercury, lead, and other poisons from the flooded areas\ncould be carried into people’s water supplies, and they fear the outbreak of\nendemic infections along the soggy new valley: malaria, leptospirosis,\nJapanese B encephalitis. The dam’s forty thousand construction workers, all\nof whom are living temporary lives in temporary housing, will spread\ngonorrhea via the prostitutes who flock to the workers’ cities. AIDS could\nrun the same course. And where will these workers go when the dam is\nfinished?\nAnd what about the nearly two million people, mostly peasants, who will\nbe displaced by the new reservoir? The government has promised them\nbenefits of jobs and land, which will cost one-third of the entire project’s\nprice tag—thirty billion dollars, according to conservative estimates. But\neastern Sichuan has long been an isolated part of the country, and local\nofficials have little direct contact with the central government. Sending huge\nsums of money down the river is far more likely to lead to corruption rather\nthan efficient population transfer.\nThere are countless tombs, dozens of ancient temples, and many priceless\ncultural relics like the White Crane Ridge. What will be done with those? The\n\nridge would be a major historical monument in most parts of the world, but\nthere is so much history in the Three Gorges region that Fuling’s carvings\ndon’t even make the A-list of threatened artifacts. Downstream is Shibaozhai,\na stunning twelve-story pagoda from the eighteenth century, and beyond that\nis Yunyang’s seventeen-hundred-year-old temple to Zhang Fei, a hero from\nthe Three Kingdoms era. Both will be lost if expensive preservation measures\naren’t undertaken. And there are tombs of the Ba people, who lived in Fuling\nand the other Yangtze regions more than two thousand years ago, and whose\nremains have never been thoroughly studied. Little is known about them, and\nnothing more will be learned after their relics are flooded forever.\nThe dam also threatens wildlife: the Siberian crane, the cloud leopard, the\nfinless porpoise, the Chinese alligator, the Chinese white river dolphin, the\nChinese sturgeon, and 172 other species of fish. Already the development of\nthe Yangtze, which carries 80 percent of China’s river traffic, has been\nenvironmentally costly, and there are but one hundred river dolphins left.\nThis is one of five freshwater dolphin species in the world, and for millennia\nit adapted to the muddy waters of the Yangtze until now it is virtually blind,\nrelying on highly developed sonar capabilities. But today the river is full of\nboats, with the racket of engines growing louder every year, and the dolphin,\ndeafened by technology and blinded by evolution, is already having trouble\navoiding danger and finding mates. Ten-thousand-ton ocean vessels might\nfinish off the species.\nThese points have been made throughout the decades that the dam has\nbeen considered by Chinese leaders. The project was first conceived by Sun\nYat-sen in 1919, and it was seriously considered by both Chiang Kai-shek\nand Mao Zedong. For the dictators it had a classic Chinese appeal, at once\npragmatic and grandiose—a way to modernize a poor country while rallying\nnational pride, a modern-day infrastructure project on the scale of the Great\nWall and the Grand Canal. Mao’s engineers completed a full-scale survey in\n1955, and they might have started construction if not for the distractions of\nthe Great Leap Forward and the Cultural Revolution.\nBut there were always voices of dissent. Even in the 1980s, as Deng\nXiaoping and Premier Li Peng moved closer to beginning actual work on the\ndam, it was one of the few major issues in China that could be debated\npublicly. Criticism was accepted, and there was no shortage of it; many\nexperts believed that constructing a series of smaller dams on the Yangtze\n\nand its tributaries would have many of the same benefits without the risks.\nThe debates continued until finally in 1987 the government tired of this\nversion of democracy and silenced it. If China’s leaders wanted the largest\ndam in the world, it would be built, regardless of the risks. None of the\ndifficulties mattered—the silt, the earthquakes, the lost relics, the extinct\nspecies, the displaced peasants. The experts could be ignored, just as they had\nbeen ignored so many times in the past: when Mao encouraged high birth\nrates in the 1950s and 1960s; when the Great Leap Forward was launched;\nwhen the Cultural Revolution began. Sometimes you need decision rather\nthan debate. There’s no sense in giving up eating for fear of choking.\nBUT STILL THE CRITICAL VOICES wouldn’t go away. Dai Qing, a\nChinese journalist who was one of the project’s most vocal opponents, spent\nten months in prison after publishing a 1989 book condemning the dam. In\n1992, Premier Li Peng pushed the National People’s Congress to take a final\nvote on the project, which was duly approved. This was no surprise—the\nNPC wasn’t much more than a rubberstamp assembly—but nevertheless\nthere were signs of strong opposition, as a third of the representatives either\nopposed the project or abstained from voting.\nChina’s first environmental lobby group was formed in response to the\ndam, and careful criticism continued even as work began in 1993. In August\nof 1996, the month I arrived in Fuling, a number of archaeologists and other\nprofessors publicly requested President Jiang Zemin to step up efforts to\npreserve the flood region’s cultural relics. Protection work had been\nscheduled to begin in 1996, but nothing had yet been done, and the\npetitioners asked that $230 million be spent on various necessary measures:\nexcavations, relocated temples, new museums. There were proposals to\nprotect the island pagoda of Shibaozhai with a dike, and there was a plan to\nmove Zhang Fei’s temple, piece by piece, to higher ground. Tianjin\nUniversity proposed building an underwater museum to house Fuling’s White\nCrane Ridge. Tourists would access the museum via a tunnel on shore, and\nthe roof of the building would rise above the new reservoir in a shape that\nrecalled the ancient strip of sandstone.\nAll of these plans and complaints greatly annoyed the forces that were\n\npushing the dam forward. Wei Tingcheng, the seventy-year-old chief\nengineer who had spent virtually his entire professional life developing the\nproject, scoffed at the “palaces” that archaeologists were proposing. “To tell\nyou the truth,” he said, in a 1996 interview with the New York Times, “the\ncommon people of China have such a low education level that they will not\nbe able to enjoy these cultural relics, and only some of these experts will go\nto these museums.”\nIt wasn’t a particularly tactful remark, but in some ways it addressed an\nimportant issue: a country like China is accustomed to making difficult\nchoices that Americans might not dream of considering. I thought of this\nevery time I visited the White Crane Ridge, where I was always amazed to\nsee the conjunction of the ancient carvings and the timeless river. Nowhere\nelse had I felt so strongly that there are two types of history, natures and\nman’s, and that one is a creature of cycles while the other, with mixed results,\naims always at straightness—progress, development, control. And I sensed\nthat on the Yangtze it was a particularly dangerous violation to force these\ntogether, pressing the river’s cycles into stagnancy behind the long line of the\ndam.\nBut this was a poetic turn of thought, and most people in Fuling couldn’t\nafford it. They didn’t have the time or interest to visit the White Crane Ridge,\nand they didn’t worry much about the relationship between man and nature.\nOften there were no other tourists on the ridge besides me, and the only time\nI ever saw a big crowd was the day I researched my story about the carvings,\nwhich was on a weekend during the Spring Festival holiday in 1998. Most\npeople in Fuling had difficulty reading the inscriptions—the characters were\nof the traditional sort that had been simplified after Liberation, and all of the\ncarvings followed the formal language that had been used by the Chinese\nintelligentsia before twentieth-century linguistic reforms. Even educated\npeople often weren’t interested. If you wanted to see local history, it wasn’t\nnecessary to go to the hassle of taking a boat—you could wander into the\ncountryside and stumble upon Qing Dynasty tombs without even searching.\nI was impressed that the city sent so many caretakers out to the ridge,\nespecially since many of these workers were well enough trained to answer\nalmost any question about the carvings’ content and history. This was far\nmore than I would have expected in a city with essentially no outside\ntourism, and at a historical site where often there weren’t any visitors at all. It\n\nwasn’t like America, where an empty and featureless late-Qing Dynasty\nbattlefield might receive millions of dollars in funding, simply because some\nsoldiers had fought and died there during a civil war. There was a great deal\nof history in China and if you protected all the ancient sites the people would\nhave nowhere to grow their crops.\nThe final government decision on the proposed underwater museum\nhadn’t yet been made, but approval seemed unlikely. The issue was\nsometimes covered in the Chongqing Evening Times, and this government-\nrun newspaper was always careful to note that officials were also considering\nanother option, which involved preserving the carvings by making a complete\nset of rubbings before the dam was built. To them, this would undoubtedly be\nthe more practical solution—the region simply didn’t have the sort of\nresources necessary to build an underwater exhibition chamber, and the\nWhite Crane Ridge didn’t mean much to the average Fuling resident. It\nseemed most likely that the rubbings would be made and sent off to a distant\nmuseum, and then the flood would cover the ridge forever. Experts estimated\nthat within ten years of the dam’s completion the silt and sand of the new\nreservoir would erase all twelve centuries’ worth of carvings.\nIt didn’t surprise me that protecting the ridge wasn’t high on the list of\nlocal priorities, but it was more striking that people in Fuling seemed just as\npassive about the dam’s other issues, including resettlement. Apart from the\ndowntown area, where the dike would be constructed, there were still large\nnumbers of people who would be displaced by the new reservoir: the\nresidents of lower East River, the peasants at the base of White Flat\nMountain, and the people who lived on the lower slopes of Raise the Flag\nMountain. They were called yimin—immigrants—and some of them would\nbe moved to the new apartments that were being constructed behind our\ncampus. This had originally been farmland, and the peasants whose fields had\nbeen taken for the construction project were compensated with discount\nprices on new apartments, as well as the choice between a government job\nand a cash settlement. The ones I spoke with had been offered six thousand\nyuan, and all of them had taken the cash—it was a lot of money in Fuling, a\nyear’s wages at a decent salary. They were also provided with a living\nstipend of seventy yuan a month, and as far as they were concerned it was a\nsweet package. After all, the last decade had seen plenty of Chinese leave the\ncountryside in search of city jobs, and it didn’t take a great deal of money to\n\npersuade a peasant not to be a peasant anymore. Every time I walked through\nthe half-built complex I saw shops full of ex-peasants, playing mah-jongg\nand smoking Magnificent Sound cigarettes, waiting patiently for the day\nwhen the flood would drive their new neighbors up from the river’s banks.\nThere were reports of immigrants who had not yet received their\ncompensations, often because of corrupt officials who embezzled funds,\nwhich seemed to be a particularly serious problem in downriver cities like\nWanxian. But even in these instances the most common reaction seemed to\nbe one of quiet complaint rather than open protest. The truth is that the\ndisruption of the dam, which seems massive to an outsider, is really nothing\nout of the ordinary when one considers recent history in the local context.\nWithin the last fifty years, China has experienced Liberation, the radical (and\ndisastrous) collectivization of the 1958–1961 Great Leap Forward, the\nCultural Revolution, and Reform and Opening.\nFuling and the other Yangtze River towns have the additional experience\nof being a focal point of Mao Zedong’s Third Line Project, which had an\nespecially large influence on the region during the 1960s. The early\npreparations for this project started in 1950, when Mao sent Deng Xiaoping\nto the southwest so he could research the feasibility of moving Shanghai’s\nmilitary industry to remote mountain areas in Sichuan and Guizhou\nprovinces. The American atomic bomb triggered this plan, as Mao became\nincreasingly concerned that China’s heavily concentrated defense industry\nwas too susceptible to a U.S. attack. The Korean War accelerated the project,\nand eventually three-quarters of China’s nuclear weapons plants were\nincorporated into the Third Line, as well as more than half of its aeronautics\nindustry. The project was, as Harrison Salisbury describes it in his book The\nNew Emperors, “something like that of picking up the whole of California’s\nhigh-tech industry and moving it bodily to the wilds of Montana as they\nexisted, say, in 1880.”\nIn comparison it seems a small matter to turn the river into a lake. Much\nof Fuling’s economy had originally come via the Third Line Project, which\nmade the locals accustomed to massive changes. The local Hailing factory,\nwhich now produces combustion engines for civilian use, had formerly been\na defense industry plant moved from Shanghai. A few miles upstream from\nFuling is the Chuan Dong boat factory, which in the old days made parts for\nnuclear submarines. All of the local Chang’an-brand cabs—the name means\n\nEternal Peace—are made by a Chongqing factory that originally produced\nfirearms for the military.\nMany of the old Third Line factories had been converted in this way since\nDeng Xiaoping came to power and started dismantling the project in 1980.\nWith China’s foreign relations rapidly improving, the American threat\nseemed less serious (and, in any case, it was clear that there wasn’t much\nprotection in putting factories in places like Fuling). The Third Line had\nalways been a huge drain on the economy; in some years as much as 50\npercent of China’s capital budget was spent on the project. Never before had\nsuch a massive country reorganized its economy on such a scale—even\nStalin’s first Five-Year Plan couldn’t compare—and according to some\nestimates, the Third Line did more damage to China’s economy than the\nCultural Revolution.\nDespite its enormous scale, the project had been developed and\ndismantled in remarkable secrecy, as few locals in Fuling and the other Third\nLine towns ever had a clear notion of what was going on. They knew that\ncommands were coming in from Beijing, and that these commands were\nbringing factories from Shanghai; and they also knew that all of this had a\nmilitary sensitivity that required secrecy. It wasn’t something you asked\nquestions about, and after four decades of that it seemed natural enough not\nto ask questions about the dam. These things just came and went—just as the\nChuan Dong factory, which arrived to build nuclear submarines, was\nsubsequently converted to a boat plant, and eventually would disappear\nforever beneath the waters of the new Yangtze.\nBut even with all of this history in mind, I still found the lack of interest\nand concern about the dam to be remarkable. People were much better\neducated now than they had been in the past, and to some degree one would\nexpect China’s historical disasters to provide lessons that prevented their\nblind repetition. Nevertheless, it seemed clear that the dam and the fate of the\nlowland immigrants were not the concern of the average citizen. Once\nTeacher Kong and I talked about the dam during class, and I asked if the\ncoming changes worried him.\n“No,” he said, and I could see he thought it was a strange question.\n“Well, is anybody worried?”\nHe thought for a moment. “If you’re an immigrant,” he said, “then maybe\nyou’d be worried. But for most people it doesn’t make any difference.”\n\nThe longer I lived in Fuling, the more I realized that this was a\ncharacteristic response. It was strange, because foreign newspapers routinely\nprinted scathing reports on the project, and there were angry critics in cities\nlike Beijing and Shanghai. But in Fuling, where the dam would affect the\npeople directly, there was no sign of unhappiness. In the two years I lived\nthere, I never heard a single resident complain about the Three Gorges\nProject, and I heard gripes about virtually every other sensitive subject.\nBut there wasn’t a strong sense of community in Fuling, as remarks like\nTeacher Kong’s illustrated. Recent history had taught the people to be\ndisengaged from public affairs, and this separation was compounded by a\nsimple lack of awareness. Fuling residents didn’t have access to reliable\ninformation about important local issues, which, combined with the\nrestrictions on public protest, made it difficult for citizens to be involved in\nany direct capacity. Most important, they neither expected nor demanded\ninformation of this sort.\nIn my opinion, this disengagement was so complete that it couldn’t be\nblamed simply on post-Liberation patterns. The past fifty years had taught the\npeople not to meddle in public affairs, but to some degree Communism\nmerely built on the foundations of traditional Chinese collectivism, which\nhad shaped social patterns for centuries. This characteristic can be difficult to\ndefine, especially with regard to its effects. My students often wrote about\nhow the Chinese were collective-minded, which inspired them to help each\nother through Socialism, while the individualistic Americans followed the\nselfish road of Capitalism.\nI didn’t agree that our countries’ political differences were so neatly (and\nmorally) explained by these contrasting attitudes toward the individual and\nthe group. But I felt that the stereotype was more accurate with regard to\nclose social networks of families and friends. The families I knew in Fuling\nwere arguably closer than the average in America, because individual\nmembers were less self-centered. They were remarkably generous with each\nother, and often this selflessness extended to good friends, who were also\ndrawn into tight social circles. Collective thought was particularly good for\nthe elderly, who were much better cared for than in America. In Fuling I\nnever saw older people abandoned in retirement homes; they almost always\nlived with their children, caring for grandchildren and doing what they could\nto help out around the family farm, business, or home. There was no question\n\nthat their lives had more of a sense of purpose and routine than I had seen\namong the elderly at home.\nBut such collectivism was limited to small groups, to families and close\nfriends and danwei, or work units, and these tight social circles also acted as\nboundaries: they were exclusive as well as inclusive, and the average Fuling\nresident appeared to feel little identification with people outside of his well-\nknown groups. In daily life I saw countless examples of this sort of thought.\nThe most common was the hassle of ticket lines, which weren’t lines so much\nas piles, great pushing mobs in which every person fought forward with no\nconcern for anybody else. It was a good example of collective thought, but\nnot in the way my students said. Collectively the mobs had one single idea—\nthat tickets must be purchased—but nothing else held them together, and so\neach individual made every effort to fulfill his personal goal as quickly as\npossible.\nAnother striking example of this brand of collectivism involved the\nreaction to pickpockets on Fuling’s public buses. Once Adam was on a bus\nfrom East River and a shifty-looking passenger stepped off, and the person\nsitting next to Adam nudged his arm.\n“You should be careful,” he said. “That was a pickpocket.”\n“Why didn’t you tell me before he got off?” Adam asked, but there was\nno answer other than a shrug. I saw the same thing happen a number of times,\nwith people gesturing that I should watch my wallet, but never did they\nconfront the thief. When I asked my students about this, they said that\neverybody knew there were pickpockets who worked the buses, but nobody\ndid anything about it. According to my students, the people were afraid to\nresist, but it seemed there was more to it than that. As long as a pickpocket\ndid not affect you personally, or affect somebody in your family, it was not\nyour business. You might quietly alert the waiguoren, because he was a\nforeign guest, but even here you didn’t take any risks. Sometimes it was\nsafest to warn him after the pickpocket had already left the bus.\nThis same instinct led to the mobs that gathered around accident victims,\nstaring passively but doing nothing to help. Crowds often formed in Fuling,\nbut I rarely saw them act as a group motivated by any sort of moral sense. I\nhad witnessed that far more often in individualistic America, where people\nwanted a community that served the individual, and as a result they\nsometimes looked at a victim and thought: I can imagine what that feels like,\n\nand so I will help. Certainly there is rubbernecking in America as well, but it\nwas nothing compared to what I saw Fuling, where the average citizen\nseemed to react to a person in trouble by thinking: That is not my brother, or\nmy friend, or anybody I know, and it is interesting to watch him suffer. When\nthere were serious car accidents, people would rush over, shouting eagerly as\nthey ran, “Sile meiyou? Sile meiyou?”—Is anybody dead? Is anybody dead?\nIn the end, the divide between crowd and mob was extremely fragile in\nFuling. Something would happen—an accident, or, more likely, a public\nargument—and a crowd would appear, gathering its own momentum, swollen\nby people with one simple reason for being there: something was happening.\nAnd occasionally the sheer weight of a mass of people behind this single idea\nwas indeed enough to make something happen; an argument would escalate,\ndriven by the audience, or somebody from the crowd would start to\nparticipate and spur the action on.\nI was both disturbed and fascinated by Fuling crowds, partly because they\nso often gathered around me. If I stumbled upon an argument or any other\npublic event that had attracted a crowd, I invariably stopped to watch. But\nusually I watched the faces of the crowd rather than the actors themselves,\nand in their expressions it was hard to recognize anything other than that\nsingle eager observation: something was happening.\nFULING IS NOT THE ONLY PLACE IN CHINA where crowds have an\nedge, and countless writers, both Chinese and foreign, have remarked this\ntendency. Lu Xun, probably the greatest Chinese literary figure of the\ntwentieth century, wrote with intense feeling and frustration about the pre-\nCommunist tendency of the Chinese to ignore their fellow men in times of\nneed. I recognized this same frustration in the writing of my own students,\nespecially when they created stories about Robin Hood coming to China.\nMany of their tales featured Robin stealing from corrupt officials, but another\ncommon theme involved Robin acting in situations where the crowd was\npassive. One student wrote:\nOne day, haunting the street, he [Robin Hood] espied a pickpocketer\nreaching for money. At the same time he noticed that people around the\n\nwoman saw the pickpocketer’s deed, but what disappointed him was that\nno one stood out and prevented the young man. They pretended to see\nnothing….\nI was struck by how many stories described scenes of this sort, and\nalways they continued with Robin coming to the aid of a person who was\nabandoned by the crowd—a victim of thieves, or somebody publicly beaten\nby bullies, or a person drowning in a river while the mob watched. To my\nstudents, this was the quintessential vision of true heroism, to act while the\ncrowd did nothing, and their holding it up as the ideal suggested that it rarely\nhappened in real life.\nI sensed that this was a small part of what contributed to the passivity\nwith regard to the Three Gorges Project in Fuling. The vast majority of the\npeople would not be directly affected by the coming changes, and so they\nweren’t concerned. Despite having large sections of the city scheduled to be\nflooded within the next decade, it wasn’t really a community issue, because\nthere wasn’t a community as one would generally define it. There were lots\nof small groups, and there was a great deal of patriotism, but like most\npatriotism anywhere in the world, this was spurred as much by fear and\nignorance as by any true sense of a connection to the Motherland. And you\ncould manipulate this fear and ignorance by telling people that the dam, even\nthough it might destroy the river and the town, was of great importance to\nChina.\nThe dam was an issue for the people who were unfortunate enough to live\nalong the banks, but even they weren’t likely to cause trouble. Like most\nChinese, they had been toughened by their history, and this was especially\ntrue in a remote place like Fuling. All of the big changes that had ever\ntouched the city came from somewhere else—the Taiping warriors had\nwandered in from the east, and the Kuomintang had come from Nanjing, and\nthe Communist land reforms had been initiated in the north before working\ntheir way south to the river valley. The Third Line Project had come and\ngone, sweeping everything in its wake. In recent years, fancy new products\nhad started making their way down the Yangtze from Chongqing, along with\nthe legal changes that allowed the new free-market economics. Even\nwaiguoren were now starting to appear on the streets of downtown Fuling.\n\nYou accepted all of these developments and adjusted to them, because they\nweren’t under your control. It was like the Yangtze itself, which came from\nanother place and went somewhere else. Someday in the future it would rise\n130 feet, and you would cope with that as well. Once I asked a friend if there\nwould be any problems associated with the river’s future rise, and, like\nTeacher Kong, he seemed surprised at the question. “Well,” he said at last,\n“the boats will all float, so they’ll be fine.”\nThere was also a sense that the dam was simply a good idea. It meant\nelectricity, which represented progress, and this was the most important issue\nfor the vast majority of Fuling’s residents. The completed dam would\nsupposedly create enough electricity to replace the burning of fifty million\ntons of coal a year, which was no small benefit in a horribly polluted country\nwhere one of every four deaths was attributed to lung disease. There were\ndays when I stood on my balcony and felt a touch of sadness as I looked at\nthe Yangtze, because I knew its days as a rushing river were numbered. But\nthere were many other days when the smog was so thick that I couldn’t see\nthe river at all.\nI also gained new perspective on this issue during the winter, when there\nwere periodic power cuts to conserve electricity. My apartment had only\nelectric heating, and sometimes these blackouts lasted for hours—long, cold\nhours, the dark apartment growing steadily more uncomfortable until my\nbreath was white in the candlelight. I found that during these periods I didn’t\nthink too much about whether Fuling’s new dike would hold, or if the\nimmigrants would be well taken care of, or whether the White Crane Ridge\nwould be adequately protected. What I thought about was getting warm. Cold\nwas like hunger; it had a way of simplifying everything.\nAnd a lot of people in China still think in these terms. It’s different from\nAmerica, where there is an average of three thousand watts of electrical\npower for every citizen—enough for every single American to turn on an\noven and a hair dryer at once. In China, there are 150 watts per head, which is\nenough for everybody to switch on a light bulb or two. But even one light\nisn’t possible for the sixty million Chinese who have no electricity at all.\nThe history of such projects in China has two different aspects. The\ncountry has been controlling and harnessing water for centuries—no other\ncivilization on earth has such a long and successful history of turning rivers\nto man’s use. The development of central Sichuan province was originally\n\nsparked by the construction of Dujiangyan, a brilliantly designed irrigation\nproject that was constructed twenty-three centuries ago and even today still\nfunctions perfectly, turning the Chengdu Basin into one of the most fertile\nrice-growing regions in the country. Even the Yangtze has been tamed\nbefore, albeit on a much smaller scale; the Gezhou Dam was completed in\n1981 on a site downstream from the location of the current project.\nBut there is also the history of Henan province, where heavy rains in\n1975 caused sixty-two modern dams to fall like dominoes, one after another,\nand 230,000 people died. Although the scale of that particular disaster was\nunique, the poor engineering was less unusual: 3,200 Chinese dams have\nburst since 1949. In this century, the failure rate of Chinese dams is 3.7\npercent, compared to 0.6 percent in the rest of the world.\nIn the end I was like most people in Fuling—I passively watched the\npreparations for the project, and I tried not to be too judgmental. I was, after\nall, an outsider. But I figured it was better to be there before the dam than\nafterward, and it was good to see the White Crane Ridge and the Three\nGorges before the river was tamed. There was man’s history and there was\nthe Yangtze’s, and I didn’t particularly want to be there when they clashed,\nchanging the place forever.\nTHE SEMESTER FINISHED near the end of January, and we had four\nweeks off for the Spring Festival Holiday. Adam and I could go anywhere we\nwished—other volunteers were going to Japan, Thailand, Laos—but for us it\nwas easiest to go downstream, which was where we went.\nWe bought tickets on the afternoon Jiangyu boat because we had been\ntold not to. Our colleagues had warned us against those ships; they were dirty\nand crowded and served primarily as transportation for people who lived\nalong the river. They didn’t stop at the temples and interesting sights, like the\ntourist ships, and there wouldn’t be other waiguoren. All of that sounded\ngood—I had already seen enough temples, and the cliffs of the Gorges would\nlook the same from any boat. Mostly I was interested in catching a glimpse of\naverage life on the river.\nPreviously the Jiangyu line had been called “The East is Red,” in honor\nof the song praising Mao Zedong, but now there was a great deal of\n\ncompetition on the Yangtze and it was better not to remind potential\ncustomers of the sort of service they had received in the past. The boat we\ntook was named the Monkey King, taken from a character in the classic\nJourney to the West, which describes a seventh-century pilgrimage to India.\nThat had been during the Tang Dynasty, and the people along the Yangtze\nhad no bad memories associated with travel in those days.\nOur boat swung away from the docks on a beautiful afternoon, the sun\nshining bright on the White Crane Ridge. The Monkey King was everything\nwe had hoped for—pleasantly grimy, bustling with passengers, and there\nwere no waiguoren besides the four of us who were traveling together. In\naddition to Adam, there was another Peace Corps volunteer, Craig Simons,\nand a boyhood friend of mine named Mike Graham, who was teaching\nEnglish and studying Chinese in Xi’an. We settled on the back deck, standing\nin the sunshine and watching the river scenery.\nThe old familiar landscape slipped behind—White Flat Mountain\ndisappeared behind a bend, and Raise the Flag Mountain faded into the\ndistance. Strange new hills rolled eastward along the Yangtze. To me they\nwere nameless, without history, and every time we passed a pagoda-topped\nmountain or a riverside hamlet I wondered what had happened there. Had Shi\nDakai and his army passed through? Were there any echoes of the lost\ndynasties, any carved stones or ancient tombs? Had a sad-eyed calligrapher\nwith a steady hand ever been exiled to those shores? I was accustomed to\nbeing the one standing still; so often I had sat on my balcony, gazing down\non the ships and wondering where they were going; but now I was looking at\nthe land and thinking about what might have happened there. I realized that\nthis was how most passing tourists saw Fuling: a dirty harbor, a long sloping\nmountain, a wandering thought—did anything ever happen here?—and then\nthe river town was gone and new scenery came into view.\nThe sun glanced off the silver-brown water; hawks glided overhead. Men\nrode unsteady bamboo rafts along the river’s edge. Coal boats puttered past.\nWorkers quarried limestone along the shore, the clink of their chisels echoing\nclear above the winter river. We docked briefly at Fengdu, a long narrow city\nstretched across the river flats. Fengdu was low, too low; in a decade all of it\nwould be flooded. There was a pagoda on a hill just beyond town and that\nwas where the sun set, glowing orange for a moment and then disappearing\nbelow the green slope.\n\nA worker with a cigarette clenched between his teeth took down the\nChinese flag and put it in a box on the stern. Mike chatted with a former\nbiology student from Beijing, who explained that in 1989 he had taken part in\nthe student demonstrations; the subsequent crackdown had prevented him\nfrom pursuing an academic career. Instead he went into business with some\nfriends, producing fire alarms for boats, and this journey was both a business\ntrip and a victory tour. “Every boat on the Yangtze has our alarms,” he said\nproudly. There were still dissidents in prison for the political crimes of 1989,\nbut there was also a whole generation of young Chinese like this man, whose\npolitical record had pushed him to the relative freedom of business.\nThe hills were rising now, blue-green with the coming darkness, and\noften they were too steep for farming. On the north bank we passed a long\nwild hillside, empty except for two small white graves pressed close together.\nThey were completely alone and the fengshui was good; they faced south,\noverlooking the river, and perhaps they were high enough to foil the coming\nreservoir.\nThe boat cut its motor, coasting with the current. The air was still. Except\nfor us the river was empty; almost nobody was on deck. Everything was quiet\nas the heart of the Yangtze swept us onward. And in that moment I felt the\npower of the river, its massive silent strength pushing us downstream as night\ncrept over the valley.\nThe two lonely tombs slipped past in the twilight. The hills loomed black\nagainst the sky. Stars began to appear, faint and cold in the distance. And\nthen the motor rumbled to life once more, and darkness came, and I went to\nmy bunk in our third-class cabin.\nThere were ten beds and eleven people in our cabin; a young man and a\nwoman were sharing the bunk below Adam. On Chinese boats and trains it\nwas common for passengers to do that, because couples rarely paid for two\nseparate bunks, and often friends did the same to save money. Nobody would\nlook twice at two men lying together on a cramped berth.\nThe woman in our cabin was shy and she kept her eyes on the floor. She\nwas bundled in sweaters and her long black hair hung straight down her back.\nHer companion was also quiet; he asked politely where we were going, and\nthen he arranged their bunk and lay down to sleep.\nThe narrow beds had a thin bamboo matting and dirty old blankets. I slept\nrestlessly, waking while we docked at Wanxian and the city lights filtered\n\ninto the cabin. After an hour the boat set off once more, and at last I fell\nasleep, lulled by the steady hum of the motor.\nI woke again in the unknown darkness of the river. I had been dreaming,\nand for an instant I was lost—was I at home in Missouri? Or Chengdu?\nFuling? I recognized the Yangtze sounds and remembered, and I was starting\nto fall back asleep when I heard the noise.\nA creak; a muffled gasp. Steady deep breathing and a sound that was soft\nand wet but not riverine. What was that? More creaks; the breathing deeper,\nless steady. I listened until I was fully awake, and then I realized what it was.\nThe couple on the bunk below Adam, the shy woman and the young man,\nwere having quiet but determined sex as the boat rocked its way toward the\nGorges.\nThey didn’t make much noise. The young Chinese were accustomed to\nthat—small rooms, crowded apartments, furtive moments in shady park\ncorners. Some of our students went in pairs down to the banks of the Wu\nRiver on Friday nights. On the boat I tried not to listen too closely, and\nfinally I fell asleep again. The next morning I would learn that Craig had also\nbeen awake, listening in disbelief, but Adam had slept soundly, oblivious to\nwhat was happening below him. And the next morning the woman again\nlooked shyly at the floor, brushing her hair away from her face as she\nprepared to disembark at Wushan.\nWE SLEPT THROUGH THE FIRST GORGE. It was called the Qutang\nGorge and was reputed to be the most dramatic of the three, the Yangtze\nnarrowing to 350 feet as it rushed beneath two-mile-high mountains. There\nwas some uncertainty among the Monkey King’s staff as to what time we\nwould reach the Qutang, but the general consensus was that we would pass\nthrough the gorge at daybreak, so I woke up early and waited on deck. Old\npeople were already doing their taiji exercises on the stern, and an enormous\nyellow moon followed us down the river. The valley was deeper now, the\nbare hills breaking into red cliffs of stone. The river flowed swift between the\nmountains. Mike joined me on deck, and together we watched the sunrise,\nwaiting for the gorge, until a passenger informed us that Wushan, our stop,\nwas just ahead. In the darkness we had slipped through the Qutang without\n\nknowing it.\n“Oh, well,” Mike said, disappointed, and then he brightened. “Hey, at\nleast we still have two more left.”\nThe town of Wushan was named after the mountain that loomed above its\nharbor, and the mountain was named after its resemblance to the character wu\n—“witch” or “wizard.” The town’s name meant Witch Mountain, and its\nwinding streets were decorated with Three Gorges water-level signs,\nforeshadowings of the hydroelectric wizardry yet to come. This was what\nMao Zedong had envisioned during a visit to Wushan in 1956, when he\ncomposed the poem “Swimming,” which describes how man can overcome\nnature through the glory of the dam:\nWalls of stone will stand upstream to the west\nTo hold back Wushan’s clouds and rain\nTill a smooth lake rises in the narrow gorges.\nIn the center of town, a billboard gave a detailed schedule for the\ncounty’s future. In 2003, when the first stage of the dam will be completed,\nthe river will rise 52.72 meters in Wushan, and then by 2009, when the\nproject is finished, the water will climb another 40 meters. By 2003, 37,908\npeople will be transferred to new homes; another 18,545 by 2009. All of this\nwas reported impassively by the billboard, which also noted the total area of\nmoved housing (1,026,082 square meters by 2003! An additional 530,094 by\n2009!), and the sign itself, with its dizzying flood of statistics, will be\ndrowned in a decade, mercifully.\nWushan was a classic river town, a larger version of Fuling’s old section,\nall tiled roofs and grimy steps and tiny alleys. The traffic was bad, taxis\nhonking their way angrily through the twisted Qing Dynasty streets, but that\nwouldn’t be a problem for long. They’d have a chance to start over, and\nundoubtedly the new Wushan would be better designed for automobiles. But\nin the meantime it was a good place for wandering and we spent two days\nthere, sleeping in the Red Flag Hotel and exploring the hills above the\nDaning River.\nThe Daning was cold and clear, rushing in angry rapids below sheer cliffs\n\nof limestone, and peasants above the cliffs were harvesting hay with scythes.\nThey tied the harvest into braids so it could be carried easily on metal-tipped\nstaves, which they used to haul the hay down to the river’s edge. On the\nbanks of the Daning they piled the hay onto wood flat-bottomed boats that\nrode the rapids down to Wushan and the Yangtze. It was a wild ride—a\nboatsman standing in the prow, using all his weight to steer an enormous\nsweep oar while another man worked a long oar to port. The hay would be\ntaken down the Yangtze to the city of Wuhan, where factories would churn it\ninto paper, and for their efforts the peasants made the equivalent of 2.4\nAmerican cents per pound, or forty-eight dollars for every ton of hay that was\ncut and braided and steered down the rushing river.\nWe spent a day hiking in the mountains, where the cliffs were so steep\nthat we couldn’t see the Daning far below, and the peasant children dropped\ntheir scythes and laughed in surprise whenever they saw us. Following the\nhay paths, we made our way down to the river, where we waved boats over to\nthe rocky shore to ask for rides. That was what we wanted—to ride the hay\nharvest down the cold clear Daning—but the peasants had been instructed\nthat waiguoren were contraband and they laughed and told us it was too\ndangerous. We bartered with one boatsman for a ride that everybody knew\nwas impossible, and he complimented us on our fledgling Chinese, and we\npraised the beauty of his countryside.\n“This place?” he said, cocking an eyebrow. “This place is too poor!”\n“But your scenery is very famous—that’s why we came.”\n“There aren’t any roads here,” he said. “Look at those people working in\nthe mountains—life here is too xinku, difficult. Every place with mountains\nlike this is poor.”\nHe shook his head and arranged the load on his boat. He was a small wiry\nman in his thirties and his eyes were hard and dark beneath a shock of black\nhair. When everything in the boat was ready, he lit a cigarette and set off for\nthe work of the rapids. But there was a gleam in his eye as he watched the\nriver, and when he hit the fast water his body grew taut, his face glowing with\nconcentration and skill and joy, the stubborn cigarette somehow surviving the\nspray of the mountain river.\n\nTHE NEXT DAY we rode the Daning the way tourists were supposed to, on\nthe authorized boats that charged eighty yuan and came with a guide. He\nshowed us the rock formations we had paid to see—the Pig God Praising\nBuddha, the Dragon’s Head, the Horse’s Ass, the Lying Beauty—and the rest\nof the tourists, all of whom were Chinese, squealed in delight as they tried to\nrecognize the shapes in the broken cliffs. This was a ritual at every Chinese\nnature site; there seemed to be no value in the natural world unless it was\nlinked to man—some shape that a mountain recalled, or a poem that had been\nwritten about it, or an ancient legend that brought the rocks to life.\nThe guide also pointed out the tiny square holes that had been carved into\nthe cliff twenty feet above the river, where in ancient days there had been a\nplank road for the trackers who hauled the boats upstream. Legend said that it\nwas along this route that the Tang Dynasty concubine Yang Guifei had her\nfavorite lichees transported in the late ninth century, heading north to the\ncapital of Chang’an. In those days, Fuling’s lichees were considered the best\nin China—even today that is still one of Fuling’s nicknames, the Lichee City\n—and for Yang Guifei the fruit was carried down the Yangtze and up the\nDaning. She was one of Chinese history’s Four Great Beauties, the sort of\nwoman for whom lichees travel great distances, and her charms so beguiled\nthe Emperor Xuanzong that his control over the country’s affairs loosened\nuntil at last rebellion broke out. The emperor fled to Sichuan, and Yang\nGuifei tried to follow, but soldiers captured her and forced her to hang\nherself. The heartbroken emperor died in exile, and his son’s effort to\nmaintain control failed, and the Tang Dynasty, after ruling for nearly three\ncenturies, collapsed—all for the love of a beautiful woman who liked Fuling\nlichees.\nWe cruised north through the Daning’s Small Three Gorges, the river\nclear and bright in the morning sunshine. The empty hay boats were making\ntheir way back upstream, the peasants wading in the shallows and towing\ntheir craft by rope through the rapids. Golden monkeys scrambled over the\ncliffs of the Bawu Gorge, swinging heavily from bushes and calling out on\nthe banks behind us.\nSeveral times the boat stopped at concrete docks, where we disembarked\nand were ushered along new-built walkways, bordered by stand after stand of\npeasants selling the same goods: Three Gorges postcards, Three Gorges\nvideos, painted rocks, grinning Buddhas, fake jade bracelets, fake ancient\n\ncompasses, fake old coins. There weren’t many tourists, because it was\nwinter, but still it was easier to sell fake things than cut hay and ride it down\nthe river for 2.4 cents a pound.\nAnd they knew the crowds would come in summer. All across China and\noverseas, a major advertising campaign was exhorting tourists to see the\nGorges before they were flooded, and the concrete walkways were part of the\npreparation for the mobs. There was something cynical about these ads:\nCome and see this place before we destroy it. But the campaign was\neffective: in 1997 Wushan would draw more tourists than any other Chinese\ncounty.\nThe peasants were aggressive salespeople, shouting and shoving their\nwares in our faces. By the third stop, I imagined the coming waters\ninundating the tourist walkways and their stalls, and I thought: Good. This\nwas how I sometimes felt on bad days in Fuling, when there was a hassle on\nthe docks and I became a sort of Chinese Noah. Let the waters come and\nwash all of this away.\nBut these dark thoughts disappeared once I was back on the river, gazing\nat the clear fast-flowing water. That would disappear as well—the Daning\nwas doomed to rise nearly three hundred feet, its gorges half filled, and these\nrapids would run clear no more. It would be part of the new reservoir, with\nthe same stagnant water as the Yangtze. Probably that would make things\neasier for the hay boats, but I suspected that the gleam in the boatsmen’s eyes\nwould also fade away.\nI felt the same sense of loss the next day, when we caught another slow\nboat down through the big gorges on the Yangtze. Again it was a lovely\nmorning, cold and bright, the wind whipping between the cliffs of the Wu\nGorge. We passed the Xiangxi River, home of Qu Yuan, the third-century-\nB.C. poet, and the home of Wang Zhaojun. She was another of the Four\nGreat Beauties, married off to the Huns for diplomatic reasons during the\nHan Dynasty. As a girl she had washed her handkerchiefs in the river; or\nperhaps she had washed the river in her handkerchiefs, because finally the\nwater ran fragrant, sweetened by the beauty on its banks, which was how it\ncame to be called the Xiangxi—the Fragrant River.\nThere was so much history along the Yangtze that one couldn’t harbor\nillusions about untouched nature. Every rock looked like something; every\ntributary carried its legends; every hill was heavy with the past. With all of\n\nthis history, it was impossible to say that the new dam was an entirely new\nsort of violation: Wang Zhaojun had turned her river into perfume, and now\nLi Peng and the engineers would turn theirs into electricity. Even the relic of\nthe White Crane Ridge had started as a sort of vandalism—Tang Dynasty\nboatsmen scratching onto a perfectly innocent piece of sandstone—and if the\nman-made dam destroyed the man-made carvings, there was perhaps\nsomething appropriate about that. The engravings had been made to serve\nboatsmen, just as the river had always served man in so many ways.\nBut to have it simply stop—to turn the river into a lake—for some reason\nthat bothered me more than anything else. In a selfish way, I didn’t mind so\nmuch the lost temples, or the scenery’s lessened magnificence, or even the\ndisplaced people. The part that bothered me the most was all that stagnant\nwater; I didn’t want to see the Daning and the Xiangxi and the Yangtze slow\ndown. I couldn’t explain it other than that they were clearly meant to rush\nforward; that was their essential nature. There was power and life and\nexuberance in those rivers, and in a decade all of that would be lost.\nWe came out of the Xiling Gorge and cruised into the construction site of\nthe dam. It was absolutely indescribable—too many cranes, too many\ndredging boats, too many piles of dirt and stone on the river’s banks. I had\nmy notebook out but I wrote nothing; the size of the thing overwhelmed me.\nAcross a distant mountain an enormous propaganda sign proclaimed in\ntwenty-foot-high characters: “Build the Three Gorges, Exploit the Yangtze.”\nEven those eight characters, although they said a great deal, didn’t describe\nvery much.\nThe only describable part of the scene was our boat. It slowed as we\nreached the construction site, and every passenger came shivering onto the\ndeck. There were People’s Liberation Army soldiers, young couples with\ntheir babies, and old peasants in military surplus coats. Many of them had\nstayed in their cabins when we went through the Wu and Xiling Gorges,\nbecause it was so cold, but now everybody stood entranced on deck as we\npassed the cranes and trucks and piles of stone. They snapped pictures. They\npointed at the cranes. The Chinese flag flapped in the wind. I looked closely\nat the faces around me, and what I saw was awe and determination—awe at\nthe massive scale of the dam, and determination to withstand the cold and see\nevery inch of the project that they could. Even the babies seemed to have that\nlook in their eyes.\n\nTHE WU RIVER\nTHE OLD FISHERMAN has no real hope of catching anything. “The\nfishing’s no good now,” he says. “In the winter it’s too cold; the fish don’t\nmove much. Mostly I come here because I’m retired—I come just to play.”\nHe smiles and looks out over the green water of the Wu River. The old man\nis perched on a rock, and beside him his rod is also sitting upright, anchored\nunder a stone. For hours at a stretch they sit beside each other, the old man\nand his fishing rod, and on cold days like today they are as silent and still as\nthe rocks themselves, until the fixed points of the scene—the rocks, the rod,\nthe old man—seem a world apart from the cold green water that rushes past\non its way to the Yangtze.\nEverything seems slow next to the current of the Wu. At the river’s\nmouth even the great Yangtze appears to stand still, its muddy water sluggish\nin comparison to the quick-moving tributary. The waters of the two rivers are\nso different that on a day like today their junction is defined by a line that\nlooks as sharp and straight as a border on a map: the Yangtze is brown, the\nWu green, and they meet like two slivers of painted glass that have been\npressed neatly together below the rough-browed peak of White Flat\nMountain.\nThe Wu is a mountain river. It starts in the heart of Guizhou province,\nwhere the hills are wild and the people few, and it falls east and north to\nSichuan. There are only a handful of cities along its length, none bigger than\nFuling, and so the water stays green and clear until it meets the Yangtze. The\nWu isn’t wide enough for big river cruisers—many of its navigable channels\nnarrow to thirty or forty feet during the dry season—and in any case there is\nno reason for the big boats to follow the green track upstream. Even here on\nthe banks of the East River district, where the heart of the city lies just across\nthe Wu, one can look upriver and see wild steep mountains in the distance.\nThey crowd against the narrow airspace above the river, and their rugged\n\nblue shapes give some sense of the remoteness of the upper Wu.\nAll rivers have distinct personalities, intangible traits that go beyond\nwidth and length and swiftness, and the two rivers in Fuling are so dissimilar\nthat their conversation is limited to the terse color line at the Wu’s mouth.\nThe Yangtze is peopled—it has been channeled, prodded, diverted, dammed;\nbuoys mark its shallows and boats of all sizes crest its polluted waters. It goes\nto Shanghai. The Wu—clear, green, lightly traveled—comes from the\nmountains. One river is all about origin; the other, destination: this is what\ndefines the contrast in their personalities. The Yangtze in its size and majesty\nseems to be going somewhere important, while the Wu in its narrow\nswiftness seems to have come from someplace wild and mysterious; and the\nfaint forms of its distant hills suggest that the river will keep its secrets. You\ncan fish all day long and the Wu will give you nothing.\nCarp are a slow-water fish and they are all the old man is hoping for,\nalong with the other eight fishermen who sit here with their rods. They are\nspread across a rocky inlet that breaks the river’s flow, their lines trailing off\ninto a dead spot where the water bulges slightly as the current rebounds from\nthe rocks. “The carp around here can be from one to eight pounds,” the old\nman says. “In town you’d pay seven or eight yuan a pound, but we don’t sell\nthem—we eat them ourselves. You can also catch black carp, but usually\nthat’s in the faster current. The river has yellow croaker, too—that’s the best\nfish in the Wu, but you can’t catch it here on the banks. It sells for twenty to\nthirty yuan a pound! And in the summer there’s grass carp, but in the\nsummer, when the fishing’s better, there are so many more people here.”\nThe fisherman is sixty-five years old, and for more than a decade he has\nbeen retired from the Chongqing factory where he used to work. He wears\nheavy-rimmed glasses and a dirty worn suit, and he is bent by age. They are a\ncontrast, this pair—the fragile-looking old man and his brand-new eight-foot-\nlong collapsible aluminum rod. “It cost one hundred and fifty yuan,” he says\nproudly. He is smoking, like all of the other men on the bank, and he smells\nfaintly of alcohol. He talks about another kind of fish, perhaps the best fish in\nthe river, the fish nobody ever catches. He says its name, but he is a dialect\nspeaker and the word—something like sanyu—is hard to understand, and he\ndoesn’t know how to write it. In any case, great fish are often nameless. “It’s\nvery rare and very good to eat,” he says, “but our government protects it. It\ncosts one hundred yuan a pound! If you catch it and nobody else is around,\n\nyou can walk away. But if anybody else is there you have to throw it back.”\nHe says this with a certain seriousness, as if he were quoting from a law that\nexplicitly gives such instructions. He clears his throat and spits on the rocks,\nand then he looks down his empty line to the dead spot in the river.\nTHE CHARACTER for Wu is shaped vaguely like a bird—a tiny tuft on\ntop, a square head with a hooked beaklike notch, a single straight line that\nrepresents a wing. Like some Chinese characters, its form echoes part of the\nmeaning: “crow.” It also means black, or dark, and perhaps the name refers to\nthe color of the river, the way it swells an angry blue-black when storm\nclouds roll in over the valley, their heavy shadows bruising the water long\nbefore a drop has struck the surface.\nBut nobody in Fuling seems to know for certain the origin of the river’s\nname, and its color is as quicksilver as the brown Yangtze is unchanging. In\nsummer, when the rains are frequent and the snowmelt steady, the swollen\nWu tends to run a smooth brown, its color fading indistinctly into the muddy\nYangtze. As the dry season begins in late autumn, the river shifts from brown\nto gray to deep blue-green, until at last in winter it stretches like a narrow\nband of jade scratched white by the rapids.\nNow the dry season is past its midpoint but the spring rains have yet to\ncome, and for weeks the Wu has run blue-green without change. It is late\nafternoon; the rapids near the bank flicker in the setting sun. Beyond the old\nfisherman, slabs of sandstone are jumbled into the very heart of the river, and\na pair of students have leaped from rock to rock until they stand on a stony\nisland in the midst of the rushing current. It is a beautiful spot—so close to\nthe water that one can feel the cold air pushed by the current, the uneven chill\nthat the river has swept north all the way from Guizhou. The students sit on\nthe rock, gazing at the scenery, listening to the river. For a moment in the\nheart of the Wu there is no sound other than the fluid voice of its current.\nNorth of the students, a boat is docked near the road that runs down from\nthe East River district, and five men chat on the deck while the sun sets. Their\nboat is eighty feet long, its deck half covered with barrels of ferric oxide.\nTomorrow there will be more cargo to load, but today’s work is finished, and\nthe men smoke cigarettes while they rest and watch the sun drop.\n\nSoon they will be bound for the city of Jiangyin in Jiangsu province, a\nthousand miles down the Yangtze. They will float under the cliffs of the\nThree Gorges, past the lowlands and lakes of central China, and on toward\nthe country’s far east. The journey will take seven days.\n“Usually we don’t go that far,” says the owner of the boat. “Usually we\ngo to Hunan—we take these barrels downriver and then we bring back\nfeldspar for the ceramics factory. It takes about five days to get to Hunan.\nThat’s Chairman Mao’s home province, did you know? We usually stop\nabout half an hour from his hometown of Shaoshan. No, I’ve never been\nthere. But Hunan is good—it’s better than here. The transportation is more\ndeveloped, and so is the economy. It’s flatter there—it’s not a mountainous\nregion like this. Fuling has bad transportation. Most places I’ve seen in China\nare more developed than here.”\nThe man is forty-three years old, and without talking to him it would be\ndifficult to guess that he is the owner of the boat. He wears a dirty gray suit\nand tennis shoes, and he squats on the deck, smoking Magnificent Sound\ncigarettes. He smokes the cheap ones, the four-yuan packs that are the\nstandard for Fuling’s laobaixing, Old Hundred Names, the common folk. His\nhands are dirty. His shoulders are broad and strong. He is a hands-on boss; he\nsupervises the loading, and he rides down the Yangtze with the other eight\nworkers who make up his crew. Clearly he is close to the other men, and he\ncarries himself more or less as one of their equals—in fact, he is slow to\nacknowledge that the boat is his. But the others treat him with a quiet respect,\nand when a stranger approaches it is the boss who does most of the talking.\n“Two of the workers can drive,” he says. “I can’t, but you only need two\n—one to drive and one to rest. It’s harder to drive a boat than a car, you\nknow. It only takes two or three months of studying to learn to drive a car,\nbut on the river it takes five years before you’re ready for the examination. A\nlicense costs ten thousand yuan. It takes so much money and trouble because\nif you make a mistake with the boat, it’s very dangerous.\n“The Three Gorges aren’t too risky if you understand the river, though.\nOf course, if you don’t know the river, it’s difficult, but we’ve been through\nthere many times. And after all those trips it’s not so interesting anymore.\nThe scenery is beautiful, of course, but I’ve seen it many, many times.”\nHis remarks echo the words of another boatsman, written long ago: “Now\nwhen I had mastered the language of this water, and had come to know every\n\ntrifling feature that bordered the great river as familiarly as I knew the letters\nof the alphabet, I had made a valuable acquisition. But I had lost something,\ntoo. I had lost something which could never be restored to me while I lived.\nAll the grace, the beauty, the poetry, had gone out of the majestic river!”\nAnd undoubtedly Mark Twain, who also lamented the construction of\nwing dams along the Mississippi, would have been even more saddened to\nsee a river like the Yangtze trapped behind huge walls of concrete. But this\nFuling boatsman is still a boatsman; his interest is shipping, not the lore and\nhistory and poetry of the river. He shrugs when asked about the new dam; it\nwon’t have much effect on his trade. The major change will be that he’ll have\nto traverse the new locks, an eight-step process that will likely take six or\nseven hours. But that won’t be a problem, and in any case he is a man who\nhas struggled against the river as often as he has been borne by its current. In\na small way he tames the Yangtze every month, and the taming of it on a\nlarger scale does nothing but impress him.\n“That dam is very big,” he says. “Have you seen it? Since they diverted\nthe river it’s very wonderful. Now we go through a side channel like this—”\nWith his finger he sketches on the deck of the boat: the bend of the new\ndiversion, the dry riverbed, the construction site. The other men watch,\ninterested. The sun has dipped below the western hills; the air is growing\ncolder. There are no boats on the Wu now and the twilit water has a purple\ntint.\nThe boat’s cabin glows white in the dying light. The men continue\ntalking, and the boss explains how most of his working life was spent as a\ntechnician for the local television broadcasting company. “It was a good job,”\nhe says. “The working conditions were good, but the salary was too low, so I\ndecided to change. I bought this boat in 1993, for more than four hundred\nthousand yuan. Most of the owners of this kind of boat are like me—we’re\nindependent, without a danwei. The owner decides where it goes and how\nlong it will take. That’s good—we have freedom. Usually we make about one\ntrip a month, and then we rest here in Fuling. This is our hometown, myself\nand all the workers. It’s good to see other parts of China, but this is where we\nlive.”\nHe motions broadly with his Magnificent Sound cigarette—to the hills of\nthe East River district, to the fading blue mound of Raise the Flag Mountain,\nto the gray downtown buildings and their early-evening lights. The lights\n\nstreak orange across the dark rapids of the untamed Wu, illuminating the cold\nclean water that rushes into the brown Yangtze and then runs eastward—past\nthe Three Gorges, past Mao’s home province, past Jiangyin, where the men\nwill finish their next journey, past Shanghai to its muddy mouth and the\nemptiness of the East China Sea.\n\nCHAPTER FIVE\n\nOpium Wars\nI LEARNED ABOUT DENG XIAOPING’S DEATH from Anne, one of\nmy students. I had just returned from vacation; it was the heart of the dry\nseason and the Wu River was low. Children along the shoreline flew kites,\nthe way they did all across China after the Spring Festival.\nOn February 20, I noticed that the Chinese flag on the teaching building\nwas at half-mast. But I didn’t think much of it until I went to get my spare\nkey from Anne, who lived downstairs and had been watching my apartment.\n“Have you heard what happened?” she asked.\n“Here in the college?”\n“No, in Beijing,” she said. “Deng Xiaoping is dead.”\nI said that I was sorry, and I asked when he had passed away.\n“Yesterday. They told us on the television today before noon. When I\nheard, I felt like crying.”\nShe smiled as she spoke, but it was the Chinese smile that served as a\nmask against deeper feelings. Those smiles could hide many emotions—\nembarrassment, anger, sadness. When the people smiled like that, it was as if\nall of the emotion was wound tightly and displaced; sometimes you caught a\nglimpse of it in the eyes, or at the corner of a mouth, or perhaps in a single\nwrinkle stretching sadly across a forehead. Anne had high cheekbones and\ndeep dimples, and today I thought I saw a trace of her sadness wavering\nalong her cheek.\n“The funeral will be on Tuesday,” she said. “They will cancel class in the\ncollege.”\n“Well,” I said, “he had a very long life.”\n“He was ninety-three years old. I think that everybody in China is sad\ntoday. Especially here in Sichuan—you know that Deng Xiaoping was from\nSichuan.”\nShe smiled once more, but now the sadness at her dimple shivered away\n\ninto pride. I took my key and thanked her, heading back upstairs to my\napartment.\nI thought about Anne’s father, the math professor who had spent eight\nyears of the Cultural Revolution working in a Sichuan coal mine, and I knew\nthat Deng Xiaoping had suffered hardships of the same kind. He had been\npurged twice, and his son had been paralyzed after a mysterious fall from an\nupper-story window during an interrogation by Red Guards. And yet Deng\nhad survived to lead the country out of the Cultural Revolution, and he was\nresponsible for the recovery of people like Anne’s father.\nThere had been no other modern Chinese leader quite like Deng\nXiaoping. His appearance was unassuming; he was short, and as a young man\nhe hadn’t been handsome like Zhou Enlai and Mao Zedong. He had grown up\nin the countryside northeast of Chongqing, where he acquired the tastes and\nhabits of a peasant. His spitting was famous, at least overseas—virtually\nevery foreign description of Deng Xiaoping noted that he spat loudly during\nimportant meetings. But he was capable of what the Chinese called “eating\nbitter”—enduring hardships—and he had a practical, hard-headed\nintelligence, which was why he was able to turn China away from the\ndisasters of a state-run economy. He was blunt, too, which was one reason\nwhy the pro-democracy demonstrations in 1989 had been suppressed with\nsuch violence. Much of what was good and bad about the Sichuanese could\nbe seen in the character of Deng Xiaoping.\nMany of my students were from Guang’an, the same region where Deng\nhad grown up. During the first semester I had asked Anne’s third-year class\nto write about their heroes, and, apart from the eleven students who chose\npeople in their families, the results were as follows:\nSeven wrote about Mao Zedong.\nFour wrote about Deng Xiaoping.\nFour wrote about Zhou Enlai.\nThree selected Napoleon, because he “broke the system of\nfeudalism in Europe.”\nOne chose Kong Fansen, a Chinese worker-martyr who died in\nTibet.\nOne chose George Washington.\n\nOne chose Nathan Hale, “an American revolutionary.”\nOne chose Muhammad Ali.\nThey had a taste for heroes who made Revolution. Even Ali was a\nrevolutionary of sorts, a man who gave up his livelihood to protest against the\nVietnam War. I admired Ali myself, but it bothered me that so many of my\nstudents idolized Mao Zedong. Wendy, who was one of the brightest in the\nclass, wrote:\nThough [Mao] is responsible for the Great Cultural Revolution, we\nmustn’t deny his achievements. As everyone knows, no gold is pure, no\nman is perfect. So we must look at things dialectically. He is the savior\nand the Red Sun of China, and he is my hero, too.\nSeth wrote along the same lines:\nOf course, Mao had a lot of mistakes, but one flaw cannot obscure the\nsplendor of the jade. He is still respected by Chinese people. His body\nblend with China’s mother earth. It can be asserted that if there is no\nMao, Chinese revolution would be much inferior. So I think Mao\nZedong fully deserve a worthy [spot] in the world’s history. I am afraid\nonly Lenin and Churchill can compare with him.\nTeaching in Fuling forced me into something approaching a personal\nrelationship with China’s past leaders, which was strange considering that\nthey had meant nothing to me during the first twenty-seven years of my life.\nBut now I encountered them everywhere—the entrance of the college library\nhad a wall-sized replica of Mao’s calligraphy, and his portrait hung in the\nbuilding where I taught. Taxi drivers dangled Deng icons from their rearview\nmirrors. Students talked about China’s politicians all the time; their writing\nwas heavy with Mao quotes, and they referred constantly to Deng Xiaoping\nand Zhou Enlai. To the people in Fuling, these men were much more than\npolitical leaders, and in turn I found myself developing strong feelings about\n\neach of them. It was like living in a new land and coming to grips with the\ngods they worshiped there.\nI disliked Mao intensely. This was not unusual for a waiguoren; there\nweren’t many reasons to like him when you came from outside. Much of\nMao’s appeal lay in his inspiring the Chinese to be proud of themselves and\ntheir country, but to a foreigner most of this pride seemed hollow—ignorance\nand jingoism, smoke and mirrors. In Fuling I came to dislike the sight of his\nfat smug face, and I disliked his pithy sayings and neat theories that were so\neasily memorized. Especially I disliked Mao’s story “The Foolish Man Who\nMoved the Mountain,” which was a favorite of my students’. It was a simple\nfable: An old man lived near an inconvenient mountain, and he tried to\nconvince the other villagers to help him move it. Of course, everybody\nscoffed at him; you can’t move a mountain! But the old man was stubborn, as\nwell as dedicated, and every day he shoveled alone at the mountain. At last\nhe moved the entire thing all by himself, and the villagers realized they had\nbeen wrong.\nPerhaps it was a useful story for children, but Mao had made this sort of\nnonsense the foundation of economic policies that affected hundreds of\nmillions of people. The 1958–1961 Great Leap Forward had been about old\nmen moving mountains: peasants were told to smelt iron in their backyards\nso that China’s industrial production could overtake Britain’s, and the result\nwas massive deforestation and the worst famine in mankind’s recorded\nhistory, killing between 30 and 45 million people. Yet less than four decades\nlater, my students still wrote about how they were inspired by “The Foolish\nMan Who Moved the Mountain.” Every time I read a student’s summary of\nthe story, something inside of me tightened and I nearly responded: Leave the\nmountain alone, you old jackass. But of course I refrained, the same way I\nwas careful not to let my students know that I hated Mao Zedong.\nZhou Enlai baffled me—he was the most foreign of the Chinese gods. He\nwas also the most respected; nationwide polls showed that he was by far the\nbiggest hero of the younger generation. They admired him because he was a\nmaster diplomat, and because he had softened the damage of the Cultural\nRevolution. These points were true—there was no doubt that his skills had\ndeeply impressed every foreign dignitary he ever met, and it seemed clear\nthat the Red Guards would have done even worse damage if Zhou had not\nreined them in at key points. But unlike Deng Xiaoping, Zhou had never\n\nopenly opposed the destruction, and even at the height of the madness he\ncould be found onstage at the rallies, waving his Little Red Book along with\nall the other fanatics.\nI thought there was something slippery about him—he was handsome and\nbrilliant, and he was good at saving his own skin. I felt that a mature\npolitician who had maintained a high position throughout the Cultural\nRevolution could not be an entirely good man, just as any adult German who\nhad risen in the Nazi hierarchy was at least partly complicit in its crimes. But\nfor the Chinese, this was an over-simplification; they were more likely to see\na politician like Zhou as an Oskar Schindler—a man who recognized the\nsystem as wrong but worked from within to temper its ill effects. There is a\nsort of pragmatic heroism in such figures, and the Chinese have always been\npragmatists, much more so than Westerners.\nI was much more sympathetic, though, to Deng Xiaoping’s brand of\npragmatism. He had his share of flaws—he had been prominent in the Anti-\nRightist campaigns of the late 1950s, when Mao solidified his hold on the\ncountry, and of course Deng had approved the violent repression of the 1989\nprotests. But at least he was capable of departing from the Party line, which\nhe proved during the Cultural Revolution, when he stepped away from the\nfawning example of Zhou Enlai and criticized the movement. As a result,\nDeng was purged, his family was punished, and his son was thrown out of a\nwindow. His criticism wasn’t very political, but he wasn’t the sort of man\nwho was interested in politics for its own sake. And he was a survivor—\nalbeit in a very different way from Zhou Enlai. I liked this about him, and\nespecially I liked Deng Xiaoping because he reflected what I admired most\nabout the Sichuanese—their toughness and their lack of pretension. In the\nend he was the only Chinese god that I understood, and I felt a touch of\nsadness at his passing.\nON THE TUESDAY MORNING after Deng Xiaoping died, there was a\nmemorial service in Beijing’s Great Hall of the People. It was broadcast live\non China Central Television, and every danwei in the country was expected\nto gather and watch the ceremony together. All flags were flown at half-mast,\nand at ten o’clock, when the service began, there was a three-minute period\n\nof nationwide mourning during which factories, boats, warships, cabs, trucks,\nand trains blew their whistles and horns. In China, that kind of memorial was\nmuch easier to organize than a moment of silence.\nOur morning classes were canceled, and all of the students and teachers\nin the English department met in a lecture hall to watch the service. The\nteachers gathered at the front of the room. Adam and I took places at the\nback, because we were uncertain of the protocol and didn’t want to draw\nattention. Horns echoed up from the rivers as everybody stood solemnly.\nParty Secretary Zhang led the ceremony in the classroom. He followed\nthe televised service and gave sharp commands to the students and teachers:\nwe stood when the dignitaries in the Great Hall of the People stood, and we\nkowtowed when they kowtowed. Together we bent forward at the waist three\ntimes, slowly, and then Party Secretary Zhang told us to sit down for the\nmemorial speech.\nPresident Jiang Zemin spoke for fifty minutes. At the start he was broken\nup, wiping his face and sobbing, and I could see that some of the students\nwere also crying. A handful of freshmen boys in the back started to giggle.\nBut they kept quiet and most of the group was sober, and after ten minutes\neverybody was simply bored. From outside I could hear the sounds of\nlaborers working on the new dormitory behind my apartment. I thought that\nof all the memorials, Deng would have liked that one the most—the steady\nhomage of clinking chisels as yet another building was constructed in China.\nAfter the service was over, Adam and I walked home with Teacher Liu.\nShe was one of the highest-ranking teachers in our department, a fifty-three-\nyear-old woman who was married to Party Secretary Wei, the top Communist\nParty cadre in the college. They lived on the third floor of our building, but I\nhad rarely spoken with Teacher Liu—like most of the cadres, she seemed\nslightly uncomfortable around us. But today for some reason she was eager to\ntalk as we made our way around the empty croquet court.\n“I am almost the same age as New China,” she said. “I was six years old\nwhen they started New China. So in some respect I saw New China grow up\n—we were both young at the same time. You probably have heard that in the\nearly years after Liberation there were many political campaigns. Especially\nin the 1960s and the 1970s—in those years there were always political\ncampaigns.”\nThe three of us came to our apartment building. As a sign of mourning\n\nshe wore a white paper flower on her chest, and she fiddled with it when we\nstopped at the entrance. She looked up at me with a tight blank smile but her\neyes glistened full of tears.\n“The political campaigns didn’t stop until Deng Xiaoping came,” she\nsaid. “We were so happy.”\nFor a few seconds she fumbled with her words. She held everything\ncarefully—the smile frozen on her face, the tears hanging stubbornly in her\neyes. She gathered herself and spoke again.\n“Now we have so much freedom,” she said, in a sort of fierce whisper.\n“We are so free. We have so much freedom now.”\nI stood there awkwardly, nodding as if I understood. I couldn’t imagine\nthinking that life in the college was any sort of true freedom, although I knew\nthat I would feel differently if I had spent the Cultural Revolution in China.\nAnd perhaps I also would have felt differently if I were married to the\nhighest-ranking Communist official in the college. I knew this thought was\ninappropriate but still I couldn’t push it away.\nShe seemed to sense this—not so much my different concept of freedom\nas my inability to imagine the horrors of China’s past.\n“You can’t know what it was like,” she said. “In those days we had so\nlittle. Half a jin of meat.” She said it hungrily, her eyes fixed on me. A jin\nwas slightly more than a pound.\n“Half a jin of meat for one month,” she said. “Every month we had\ntwenty-seven jin of rice. That’s all—twenty-seven jin! Do you know how\nlittle that is? Now a family might eat that much in a week; for us it was a\nmonth. An entire month! In those times we were always hungry.” She held\nher stomach, her eyes still glistening, and I realized that true hunger was even\nharder for me to imagine than being overjoyed at the freedom of Fuling\nTeachers College.\n“When I finished university,” she said, “I was sent to the remote\ncountryside. It was near the Wu River, almost to Guizhou. I was a peasant.\nYou must remember that my home was Chongqing; I was not from the\ncountryside. I was not a peasant. But I could not go back to my home. For\nthree years I was a peasant, and then for three years I taught in a country\nschool. Middle school. I taught the students to read.\n“You cannot imagine those times. Jiang Qing”—she hissed the name, the\nway I’d heard other Chinese say it—“Jiang Qing, Mao’s wife, she said no\n\nneed to learn, no reason to learn the ABCs. No ABCs!” And she repeated it a\nfew times, her voice rising angrily—no ABCs, no ABCs, no ABCs. She\nseemed to realize that it sounded almost silly to be crying and saying that, but\nthere was no other way to express what it was like to have been an educated\ncity woman in the countryside, a teacher with nothing to teach. Even now\nthere was no way to tell us what it was like to be fifty-three years old and still\nburn with the memory of time wasted like that. Adam and I stood there in\nsilence. I thought that I should say something, and finally I asked her how\ntoday had been different from the services when Mao died in 1976.\n“At that time, every danwei had a committee in charge of mourning,” she\nsaid: “We wore white, we made wreaths, and for a week there was mourning.\nEverybody worked for the funeral. Students, teachers, workers, peasants—\neverybody worked. Everything was stopped. This time it is very different.”\nShe swept the air with her arm, gesturing out to the teaching building, the\ncity, the boats on the rivers. “This,” she said, “is cheap.”\nShe spat out the word, and then she wiped her eyes and went inside the\nbuilding. I had seen more emotion from her in five minutes than I usually saw\nin weeks of Fuling conversations. I passed her in the street the next day and\nshe smiled but said nothing, the same way she always had in the past. Over\nthe next year and a half we never had another serious conversation.\nFOR THE FIRST SIX WEEKS of term, all of the third-year students\nreturned to their hometowns to do practice teaching, and I only had four\nhours of class a week. They were first-year speaking classes and the\npreparation work was not difficult. My job took perhaps five hours a week.\nBy now Adam and I were spending less time together, although usually\nwe met for a meal at least once a day. We had always been concerned about\nrelying too much on each other, which was a common pattern for Peace\nCorps volunteers in China. Living as a foreigner in a small town in Sichuan\nwas often difficult, and the temptation was to withdraw into the foreign\ncommunity—even if it was a community of only two.\nThis was an easy way to miss whatever the town had to offer, and it was\nalso an easy way to ruin a friendship. Somehow, most of the Peace Corps\npairings worked out, but there were a few that didn’t, sometimes\n\nspectacularly. Occasionally volunteers could hardly speak to each other after\na year. This wasn’t what either Adam or I wanted from our experience in\nFuling, and so that was our balancing act—to be friends without the\nclaustrophobia, to support without leaning.\nProbably it helped that in certain respects we were similar. Adam was\nfrom Minnesota; I was from Missouri; both of us had gone to university on\nthe East Coast. Our parents taught in colleges. We had lived overseas before.\nEach of us was independent—that was crucial. And each of us had an\nanalytical turn of mind, which was often how we dealt with Fuling, talking\nwith each other as we tried to figure out why things happened the way they\ndid.\nBut we spent most of our time together doing what the Chinese call chui\nniu—“blowing the bull.” We told old stories and talked sports; we joked\naround and created our own mythology of Fuling, composed of the places\nand people we saw every day: Rat Girl, Jackson, Left Eye, Copy Girl, the\nClub, the Karaoke Boat, the Hepatitis B Barber Shop. None of it would have\nmade sense to anybody else, like our language itself. Really we had four\nlanguages: Chinese; Special English, which we used when speaking slowly\nwith the students; Normal English, for the rare times when we happened to\ngo someplace where there were other waiguoren; and Fuling English, which\nwas what we spoke when we were together. Fuling English consisted of a\ncombination of slang from our previous lives, references to the local\nmythology, and a sort of pidgin Chinese: certain useful Chinese words and\nphrases, spoken without tones, and often corrupted with an English “s” at the\nend (there are no plurals in Chinese and words never end in an “s” sound). In\nour Fuling English, guanxi meant “relationship” xiaojies were “young\nwomen” mafan was “trouble.” When you spent that much time with a person\nit was inevitable that you developed your own language—and part of that\nlanguage was that there were many things that didn’t have to be said at all.\nThe need for space was one of those unspoken understandings, and\nduring the start of the second semester we began to drift into more\nindependent lives. I focused on studying Chinese, and I also started to spend\nmore time in the city, which was slowly becoming less intimidating. I\nrealized that the key was finding places I went to regularly—it was no good\njust to wander around downtown Fuling, because that way I attracted too\nmuch attention and the passersby shouted at me. It was better to go to the\n\nsame places at the same times every week, and then the people became\naccustomed to me and it was easier to have conversations.\nOften I stopped by the South Mountain Gate Park, where there was a\nphotographer named Ke Xianlong who was interesting to talk with. He was a\ndialect speaker but he was very patient, and three or four times a week I’d\ntalk with him and then make my way up to the Wangzhou Park at the top of\nFuling City.\nThe park had a nice teahouse where I’d sip tea and study my textbook.\nThere was a friendly xiaojie named Song Furong who worked there, along\nwith some other girls whose names I never learned, and we’d kid each other\nand they’d teach me words I shouldn’t know. I always used the words\ninnocently, as if I had no idea what I was saying, and the xiaojies would\ncover their mouths and howl with laughter.\nI started to realize that in a place like Fuling it actually wasn’t so difficult\nto learn spoken Chinese once you had the foundation. Virtually nobody knew\nEnglish, and there was so much curiosity about waiguoren that people\nconstantly approached me, and once we started talking there seemed no limit\nto their interest and patience. The most important part of my study routine\nwas simply making myself available—I sat in the teahouse with my textbook,\nand whoever was walking past would stop to see what the waiguoren was\nreading. We’d start talking and if it was a good conversation it would last for\nthirty minutes, and then somebody else would stop. I’d spend three hours\nthere, the xiaojies refilling my cup whenever it cooled, and in that time I’d\nhave conversations with more than a dozen people. The city was teaching me\nChinese.\nAbove the teahouse was a karaoke bar where they had prostitutes, and\nsometimes young men would walk past me on their way upstairs. Often they\nwere drunk, moving in packs with their beepers and cigarettes, and\nsometimes they’d stop to talk. Usually I could tell they just wanted to give\nthe waiguoren a hard time and I’d pretend I didn’t understand, and they’d\nlaugh and move on. Song Furong thought that was funny, and after the young\nmen had left we’d talk about why I hadn’t liked them. That was something\nelse I realized that semester: One of the benefits of being a waiguoren was\nthat nobody could tell how much you knew.\nI had finished the language lessons about catching trains and saying\ngoodbye, and now my new textbook dealt with Chinese history and politics.\n\nIt was a Chinese-published book with a Chinese political agenda, which\nmade the classes much more interesting, because the vocabulary was useful\nand I could watch the way my tutors reacted to the material. One chapter\nfeatured a political debate between two fictional American students of\nChinese, one of whom asked how it was possible that China could be a\ndemocratic country when it was led by only one party. The other American\nstudent, named John, answered:\nWhy can’t a country led by a single party achieve a high level of\ndemocracy? The Chinese Communist Party represents the interests of\nevery group, and the Chinese people enjoy wide-ranging democratic\nrights.\nWhen we reviewed that lesson one day in class, Teacher Kong paused\nand ran his finger over the paragraph. “Some people,” he said, “would not\nagree with that.”\nI said that I didn’t know much about it, although most Americans had\ntheir own opinions about Chinese politics.\n“What do most Americans think?” he asked.\n“Most Americans think that China is not a democratic country.”\nI wouldn’t have said that to any of my students, or anybody on the street,\nbut it was different with Teacher Kong. I knew he wasn’t a dissident—and\nindeed he would join the Communist Party himself the next year—but he was\nslow to judge and he could listen to ideas without either flatly accepting or\nrefuting them. In Fuling those were rare qualities.\n“Our China is different from America, I think,” he said. “The education\nlevel in America is higher. Most of the Chinese are peasants, and if they\nchose our leaders directly it would be dangerous, because anybody could lie\nto them, or trick them. China isn’t ready for that yet. But that’s just my\nopinion—I don’t know if it’s correct or not.”\nHe appeared to be slightly uncomfortable with the subject and I didn’t\npursue it. And in truth I wasn’t certain about my own notion of democracy,\nwhich had broadened considerably since my arrival in China. Part of this was\nbecause the Chinese government also claimed the word, which made me\n\nconsider how it was sometimes abused in America. Teacher Kong’s remark\nwas cynical, but at the same time there was a strain of idealism in the way he\nlooked at American-style democracy, because he didn’t realize that in fact the\npoor and uneducated rarely bothered to vote in the United States. Sometimes\nthat was how I felt about democracy—regardless of whether it was the\nChinese or the American government claiming to be empowered by the\ncommon man, part of it was dishonest wordplay. But even at my most cynical\nI recognized that there was an enormous difference in the degree of\ndishonesty.\nLiving in Fuling taught me that democracy is as much a matter of\ntolerance as of choice. After talking with Teacher Kong, I thought about my\nown participation in America’s system, and I realized just how shallow my\ninvolvement had been. I had never cast a vote that truly made a difference,\nand I never would; elections are not decided by a single tally. Nor had I ever\nplayed a major role in organizing a demonstration, and I had yet to react to an\ninjustice by writing letters or alerting the press. Essentially, this was the\nextent of my role in American democracy: casting meaningless votes and\naccepting the results. But still I didn’t feel particularly powerless, because I\nknew that my role resulted from my own decisions, and I could always\nincrease my involvement if something struck me as intolerable. In the past I\nhad simply chosen not to be involved, and this choice was just as democratic\nas any positive act.\nMany of these democratic options had been made extremely difficult in\nFuling, where the price of dissent was high. Or at least I assumed that it was,\nbecause I had read about Chinese dissidents; I certainly didn’t meet very\nmany in Fuling. It was far more common to meet people like Teacher Kong,\nwho seemed uninspired by the notion of democracy. Of course, such citizens\nwere the natural by-product of a system like China’s, but this worked both\nways: the Chinese system could also be seen as the natural creation of people\nwho had little faith in their own power. As to which had come first, the\npeople or the system, that was hard to say. But it was striking that while most\nFuling residents were completely disengaged from public affairs, there wasn’t\na strong sense of powerlessness that accompanied this condition. Rather they\ndidn’t seem to care very much, and it wasn’t much different from the way I\nfelt in America. In the end, Fuling struck me as a sort of democracy—perhaps\na Democracy with Chinese Characteristics—because the vast majority of the\n\ncitizens quietly tolerated the government. And the longer I lived there, the\nmore I was inclined to see this as the silent consent of people who had chosen\nnot to exercise other options.\nThe week after my class with Teacher Kong, I reviewed the same chapter\nin my textbook with Teacher Liao. When we came to John’s response, I\nasked her what she thought.\n“That’s correct,” she said. “China is a democratic country.”\n“But some Chinese think it’s a problem that there’s only one party, don’t\nthey?” I asked.\n“No,” she said. “All of us support the Communist Party. And we have\nelections all the time—we had one recently. China is a democratic country.”\n“Do you think that China has any Capitalist Characteristics?” I asked,\nbecause this was something else that Teacher Kong and I had discussed. We\nhad talked about the way capitalism was taking hold as Chinese state-owned\nenterprises were privatized, and how the reforms allowed people to own\nprivate businesses. But everything was different with Teacher Liao—the\nlanguage was the same, but its political parameters shifted dramatically\nwhenever I changed between my two teachers.\n“China has no Capitalist Characteristics,” she said flatly. “It is Socialism\nwith Chinese Characteristics.”\nIt was pointless to argue with Teacher Liao, at least with regard to\npolitics, where she strictly followed the government line. And it was\nremarkable how far this line stretched; in Fuling bookstores you could buy a\ncopy of the Constitution of the People’s Republic of China, which included\nArticle 35, Section II:\nCitizens of the People’s Republic of China enjoy freedom of speech,\nof the press, of assembly, of association, of procession, and of\ndemonstration.\nThat was almost as good as the slave-owning American revolutionaries\nwriting about equality. My favorite part of the Chinese Constitution was\nArticle 32, Section 1:\n\nThe People’s Republic of China may grant asylum to foreigners who\nrequest it for political reasons.\nNewspapers were the same way, and anybody in Fuling who wanted real\nnews relied on either the Voice of America, itself a propaganda organ, or\nxiaodao xiaoxi, which translated as “small alley news,” or word of mouth. It\nseemed incredible that in a modernizing country of China’s size many people\nturned to rumor as the most reliable source for information about current\nevents. To me, this was the most substantial political distinction between\nAmerica and China—even though much of what America believed about\nitself was also fraudulent, at least the press and publishers could express\nunorthodox views. It wasn’t until I went to China that I realized a person\ncould become homesick for conspiracy theories.\nAt the start of the spring semester, an English-speaking teacher from\nanother department asked if he could borrow some literature books, and I\ninvited him to stop by my apartment. I showed him my small collection—\nHemingway, Jack London, Mark Twain, a Norton Anthology. I also had\nsome political books about China, which he examined carefully.\n“Those books all criticize China,” I said. “I don’t know if they are true or\nnot, but probably you wouldn’t like them.”\nHis eyes lit up. He was a tiny man with thick glasses and a jutting jaw,\nand he took my copy of China Wakes and looked at the back cover. “In China\nwe can’t get books like this,” he said.\n“That book is very negative,” I said. “It was written by two reporters for\nthe New York Times. Some of it is about the student protests in 1989.”\n“Can I borrow it?” he asked.\nI saw no harm in that and I gave him the book. I asked him how he\nusually found out about things that were forbidden, and he mentioned the\nsmall alley news. Recently the foreign press had carried reports of ethnic\nunrest in the far-western province of Xinjiang, and out of curiosity I asked if\nhe had heard anything.\n“I’ve heard that there are some problems there,” he said. “Or actually,\nthey said on the television that there are no problems there. But if there were\nno problems, why would they say so on the television? So I knew there must\nbe something wrong. But I don’t know exactly what is happening.”\n\nI gave him a recent copy of Newsweek that included an article about\nXinjiang, and he took his book and left. Over the semester he came\nperiodically to borrow my books, although he never said much about what he\nthought of them. He was a shy, quiet man who never seemed comfortable\ntalking with me, and it was the same way with a couple of young English\nteachers who occasionally stopped by my apartment. I sensed that these men\nwere searching for friendship, but something seemed to be holding them\nback. Perhaps it was their own uncertainty, but more likely it was the\nwarnings of the college; I never learned for sure. To me they were nothing\nmore than shadowy figures who seemed to be groping for something that\ncouldn’t be found in Fuling.\nTeacher Liao was different—she had no patience for the foreign view of\nChina. In some ways I couldn’t blame her; the American press tended to\nportray a China that was overwhelmingly negative and Beijing-centered. And\nyet like any waiguoren in China, I knew that I had access to a great deal of\ninformation that was unavailable to the Chinese, and as a result I often felt as\nif I understood the political situation better than the locals. It was impossible\nto avoid this type of arrogance, even though I realized that it was misleading\nand condescending, and I was careful not to voice my opinions openly. But\nTeacher Liao obviously noticed my skepticism about the material we studied,\nand I, in turn, sensed her suspicion of what I had been taught in America. She\nliked that I was learning Chinese fairly quickly, and I could see that she\nrespected my efforts to study the language. But as my Chinese improved we\nbegan to see each other more clearly, and soon there was no avoiding the\ncentral issue in our relationship: that I was a waiguoren and she was Chinese.\nDuring the spring semester our relationship grew increasingly unhealthy,\nfueled by the political and historical lessons in my book, and often there was\na definite tension as we prodded each other carefully. When the textbook\ndiscussed the Opium Wars, she quietly pointed out that America had also\nbenefited from the unequal treaties that were forced upon the Chinese, and\nshe lingered over the description of the waiguoren looting and burning the\nSummer Palace. During our review of the chapter on science and technology,\nshe was careful to note that although the American experts had said there\nwere no major oil reserves in China, native scientists had discovered the vast\nDaqing fields after Liberation. This pleased Teacher Liao immensely—she\npointed out that the Chinese were now self-sufficient in oil, whereas America\n\nhad to rely on the Middle East.\nI had never been a patriot, and certainly I had never been patriotic about\noil, but things were different now—I was a waiguoren, and I was developing\na waiguoren’s sensitivity to any sort of slight. The second time Teacher Liao\nbragged about China’s oil self-sufficiency, I noted that China had actually\nbecome a net oil importer in 1995. Although Teacher Liao distrusted my\nsources (Newsweek), I could see that she was annoyed by the readiness and\nprecision of my statistics. And I pointed out that Americans don’t worry\nmuch about being self-sufficient in things like oil, because we have good\nrelations with many countries and have never made an effort to close\nourselves to the outside world. More sensible voices sounded in my head—\nwhat about Pat Buchanan? America First? the anti-Chinese laws in the\nnineteenth century?—but balance was not my goal. I was fighting fire with\nfire, and I responded to propaganda with more of the same.\nThose were our Opium Wars—quiet and meaningless battles over\nChinese and American history, fueled by indirect remarks and careful\ninnuendo. The same thing was happening in Adam’s classes, and sometimes\nwe discussed the best way to react when Teacher Liao started to needle us\nabout the unequal treaties or the loss of Hong Kong. It was difficult because\nshe always had the advantage; the book was on her side, and so was the\nlanguage. In Chinese, the Korean War is known as the “War of Resistance\nAgainst the Americans and in Support of the Koreans,” and it is difficult to\ndiscuss a war with that name and make the Americans look good. And the\nChinese use personal pronouns when they speak of national affairs—it’s “our\nChina” and “your America.” I found this to be a small but critical quirk in the\nlanguage; every political discussion quickly became polarized, and every\naspect of America—both its successes and its failures—became my personal\naffair.\nIn response, Adam and I learned to attack Teacher Liao’s soft spots. It\nwas always effective to mention innocently how rich Hong Kong had become\nunder British rule, and we knew that we could get a rise out of her by talking\nabout Premier Li Peng. He wasn’t popular in China—in particular, many\nChinese intellectuals hated him, because of his old-style conservatism and\nbecause he had supported the use of violence in quelling the Tiananmen\nSquare protests. And it was no secret that the foreign press criticized him\nmercilessly. One day there was a lull in class and I brought up the subject,\n\njust to see how Teacher Liao would react.\n“What do the Chinese people think of Li Peng?” I asked.\n“All of us like Li Peng,” she said quickly. Invariably her responses were\nlike that—all or nothing, white or black.\nI nodded and continued, “He had some guanxi with Zhou Enlai, didn’t\nhe?”\n“What do you mean?”\n“I don’t know how to say it—I read in a history book that Li Peng didn’t\nhave parents.” I was trying to say “orphan” in a roundabout way I was hoping\nto get to nepotism. “How do you say it if a child doesn’t have parents?” I\nasked.\n“Sishengzi?” she said.\n“Right,” I said. “I read that Li Peng was a sishengzi, and Zhou Enlai took\ncare of him.”\nHer reaction was immediate.\n“Budui!” she said angrily. “That’s foreign luanshou! That’s waiguoren\ntalking noise! It’s not true! I know you read that in your foreign newspapers,\nbut it’s completely false!”\nIt was the first time I’d seen her openly angry, and I had never imagined\nthat Li Peng’s adoption was such a touchy subject. I asked her to write that\nword, sishengzi, and she scratched it hard on my notebook, her face red. The\nthree characters translated literally as “personal child.” I grabbed my\ndictionary and looked it up: “illegitimate child; bastard.” I had been saying\nthat Li Peng was Zhou Enlai’s bastard son.\n“Uhm,” I said, “that’s not the right word. Sorry.”\nI picked up the dictionary again and fumbled through it until I found the\ncorrect term: gu’er. I apologized again for the mistake and she seemed\nrelieved; yes, she said, Li Peng had been adopted by Zhou Enlai. I left it at\nthat—I was embarrassed to have pushed her so far, even if it had been partly\nunintentional. The next class she asked me pointedly why the American\ngovernment helped its athletes take performance-enhancing drugs, and we\nwent around again, this time with me on the defensive. And so it went every\nother week, our Opium Wars raging as the countdown to Hong Kong’s return\ndrew closer and closer.\n\nONE DAY IN LATE MARCH, I was studying Chinese at my desk when I\nsaw a lizard skittering across the ceiling. He was dull green with bulging\nblack eyes, and he moved in jerks and starts, like a film missing every third\nframe.\nHe was the first one I’d seen since October. On warm autumn nights the\napartment had been full of them, slipping across the ceiling in search of\nmosquitoes. Light startled them; often I’d walk into a room, flip the switch,\nand three or four would fall off the ceiling. They always landed flatly, their\nwebbed feet slapping against the concrete floor. The March lizard was a\nsmall one, and he crept slowly around the doorway and disappeared.\nThe peach trees on Raise the Flag Mountain showed tiny white buds.\nFlowers on campus were beginning to bloom, and every few days we had\nrain. The sand banks and rocky islands in the rivers were steadily shrinking.\nThe White Crane Ridge disappeared.\nFor two days the winter fog faded and the sun shone more brightly than it\nhad in months. I went running in a short-sleeved shirt. Peasants in the fields\nwere wading behind oxen, plowing the mud. Rice-planting season was here.\nAnd then the cold returned as suddenly as it had left. The fog came back\nand settled thick above the rivers. Some of the flowers died. The buds on\nRaise the Flag Mountain paused. The peasants kept plowing. In the stairway\noutside of my apartment, I found a dead lizard, his dusty eyes gray and dull.\nA FEW DAYS LATER I took a long hike up the Wu River. I packed my\ntent and sleeping bag, along with my camping stove. I put a compass in my\npocket. Recently my younger sister Angela had sent me an old paperback\ncopy of Ted Williams’s baseball autobiography, which I brought as well. I\nhoisted the pack onto my shoulders and walked out the side gate of the\ncollege.\nI headed south past the mouth of Mo Pan Valley and up the street through\nthe Taiji medicine factory district. Everybody stopped to stare as I walked\npast; I heard laughter behind me. An old man paused on the side of the road,\nsmiling. “Are you going home?” he asked.\n“Yes,” I said, and I waved to him and kept walking.\nIt was a gray, misty morning, with a cold wind blowing down the Wu\n\nRiver valley, but it felt good to have a full pack on my shoulders, and it felt\ngood to be walking. I came to the Wu River Great Bridge, where the East\nRiver road swung west across the water, and I crossed the street, taking the\nfootpath that ran above the river. All winter I had looked out my window at\nthe steep green hills and the far bend of the Wu, hazy in the distance, and all\nwinter I had been thinking: Someday in the spring I’ll see what’s beyond that\nbend.\nThe water was a chalky green and I followed the paths along the Wu’s\nwestern bank. I passed the first side valley with its broken Buddhist shrine\ntucked underneath low trees, and I walked through some small farms and\ncame to the Fuling Liangtang ore factory, where they dug gravel out of the\nhills. A pale dust covered everything—the docks, the workers’ dormitories,\nthe massive steel chutes that carried the rocks down from the hills. In the\ncenter of the complex was a sign:\nHappy Happy Go to Work,\nSafe Safe Return Home\nIn Chinese you can double adjectives for emphasis, and that was a\ncommon propaganda message in factories and construction sites. It was\nalways a pretty good indication that you should keep moving. There were lots\nof those signs across the Yangtze River, where they were blasting the hell out\nof the mountains with dynamite to make a new highway to Chongqing.\nThe air in the ore factory tasted like dirt and jackhammers roared steadily.\nWorkers—curious curious, surprised surprised—stared at me as I passed. I\nclimbed the torn hillside above the factory, the dust settling dry in my throat,\nand then the path swung west into another cross valley and I had entered the\ncountryside.\nThe Wu was bordered by high white cliffs of limestone, and crops in the\nlower valley were terraced atop walls of rock. Wheat stood in neat rows,\nnearly ready for harvest, and the hills were sprinkled with the yellow of\nrapeseed coming into season. I walked alongside vegetable plots—radishes,\nonions, purple-flowered broad beans. Down along the valley floor were\n\nfarmhouses, mud-walled with tile roofs, and a cow grazed beside a stand of\nbamboo. The noise of the factory was gone; I heard birds chirping, and\noccasionally a rooster crowed. Banana trees stood in the lowlands, their dead\nleaves rustling in the slight breeze.\nI kept the river to my right and followed the paths that looked good as I\nmade my way south. In the wider valleys, the peasants were plowing their\npaddies behind placid water buffalo, and they always stopped in astonishment\nwhen I walked past. The water buffalo stood thoughtfully while the peasants\nasked me where I had come from and where I was going. I had no clear\ndestination in mind, which bothered them; their shouts echoed up through the\nvalley: “Butong! Butong! That path doesn’t go through! Come back!” I\nalways heard the same thing but I kept walking, because one path always led\nto the next peasant home and from there another trail set off through the hills.\nHere the water of the Wu looked even cleaner than in Fuling, a deep dull\ngreen that was torn into white strips by the rapids. The river traffic was light\n—the occasional ferry, a barge every half hour or so, some small sampans\nflitting along the banks. The little boats bumped over the rapids and then\nsettled calm in the deep water.\nBy noon I could feel a rhythm developing—the steady footsteps, the even\nswing of my pack—and I wondered what it would be like to keep going, to\nwalk south into Guizhou and beyond, watching the hills change and listening\nto the accents become less and less intelligible. Even here it was difficult to\ncommunicate with the people; their dialect was much stronger than in the city\nand usually they were overcome with the shock of seeing a waiguoren. It was\nhard to ask them for directions, because they always believed that I was\nhopelessly lost and they wanted to help me catch a boat back to Fuling. But I\nsmiled and thanked them, heading off southward while their warnings rang in\nmy ears.\nSometimes the white cliffs rose too steeply and I detoured away from the\nriver, and then I used my compass and kept an eye on the deep airspace\nabove the Wu. You could see it from miles away, because the hills fell away\nsuddenly at the edge of the river valley, leaving an emptiness that hung like a\nshadow across the sky. And so even when the water was out of sight I\nfollowed the Wu’s reflection along the horizon as it twisted south.\nIn late afternoon the sun shined weakly through the fog as I made my\nway down a steep path toward the banks of the river. I had no idea how far\n\nI’d gone—perhaps twelve miles, maybe fourteen. I met four people who had\njust returned on the last boat from Fuling, and they warned me that there\nwouldn’t be another one until early tomorrow morning. I said that was fine.\nThey asked where I had come from, and I told them I was an American\nteacher who worked in the city.\n“How much money do you make?” asked a young man. He was dressed\nin a new sweater and he had just done some shopping in the city. His was a\ncommon question and I answered it truthfully, as I always did. I made one\nthousand yuan a month, which was almost 120 American dollars.\n“Wah!” he said. “That’s not enough! A waiguoren should make more\nthan that! Why don’t you find another job?”\nEverybody told me that wherever I went. One of the difficult aspects of\nbeing a Peace Corps volunteer was that the locals often thought you were a\nfool for accepting such low wages. The man shook his head and then his\ngirlfriend stepped forward shyly, asking why I had come to this part of the\ncountry.\n“It’s spring and I like walking,” I said. “And in Fuling I have no work to\ndo.”\nThis was even more ridiculous than my salary and they shook their heads.\n“You carry too many things,” the woman said, tugging at my bag. That was\nalso true and I was happy to see that the people in this remote place were as\nsensible as the ones I knew in Fuling. They waved goodbye and headed up\nthe path, and I walked down through a narrow gorge to the Wu.\nNobody else was down by the water. It was rocky along the bank, with a\nbig slab of limestone where the docking ferries had worn a deep square\ngroove. Higher up there was a grassy spot overlooking the river. I pitched my\ntent there and it was a good place for sleeping. There were no houses nearby\nand the cliffs rose sheer into the mist.\nI sat on a rock at the water’s edge, watching the river. I took out Ted\nWilliams’s book and started reading:\nI wanted to be the greatest hitter who ever lived. A man has to have\nhis goals—for a day, for a lifetime—and that was mine, to have people\nsay, “There goes Ted Williams, the greatest hitter who ever lived.”\nCertainly nobody ever worked harder at it. It was the center of my heart,\n\nhitting a baseball.\nIt was a good book to read at the end of March on the banks of the Wu\nRiver. I finished half of it there on the rock, and then the mist grew heavier\nand the temperature dropped. A sampan drifted past and I sat motionless, so\nthe passengers couldn’t see me in the growing darkness. They were husband\nand wife, like so many of the pairs that worked the small fishing boats. The\nwoman stood sculling in the stern with the long oar while her husband\nworked the nets at the prow. They did not speak to each other. I wondered\nwhat that would be like, to be married to somebody and spend all day\nworking together on a boat that was fifteen feet long. The couple on the\nsampan seemed to be handling it all right. They worked skillfully and all I\ncould hear was the soft slipping sound of the oar and the quiet splashing as\nthe man pulled the nets on board. It was too dark to see if they had had any\nluck. They drifted out of sight around the bend, heading downstream.\nThe rain started softly and I found a rock overhang that kept my stove\ndry. I arranged everything carefully and boiled the rest of the water I had\nbeen carrying. I cooked oatmeal and then noodles, and after eating I turned\noff the stove so the water would cool. Some of it I poured into my bottle and\nthe rest I left to clean the bowls.\nThe rain was falling harder now and I made sure that the tent was\nsatisfactory. I laid out my sleeping bag, and I put all of my gear inside the\ntent, checking the lines and stakes. Everything was fine. In Switzerland I had\nonce camped in that tent for two months, and ever since that summer there\nwas a specific way in which everything had to be done.\nThe water on the stove cooled and I used it to clean up. I thought about\nTed Williams and wondered how he would like Sichuan. Probably not very\nwell; he had fought on the wrong side in the War of Resistance Against the\nAmericans and in Support of the Koreans, and during that war his plane had\nbeen shot down. But he was a hell of a good fisherman and maybe the Wu\nRiver would appeal to that. It wasn’t a bad place to be a waiguoren once you\nwere accustomed to things.\nThe rain came down hard after I got in the tent. I could hear the river\nrunning fast over the rocks. In the morning a rusted boat pulled up to the\nbank and for three yuan I rode it back to the East River dock. That was my\n\nfirst spring in Fuling.\n\nWHITE FLAT MOUNTAIN\nPAULOWNIA TREES BLOOM PURPLE AND WHITE along the lower\nslopes of White Flat Mountain. The trees’ flowers are short-lived—next week\nthey will begin to wither and fade—and the soft yellow of the rapeseed will\nsoon be cut down from the hills. After that, the bright green ricebeds will\ndisappear, moved and dispersed into the waiting muck of the paddies. Spring\nin Fuling does not arrive so much as it rushes through, a blur of changing\ncolors.\nToday is April 5, Qing Ming, the Day of Pure Brightness. He Zhonggui\nand his family are taking the ferry across the Yangtze to White Flat\nMountain. They are well dressed: the children in new clothes, the women in\nhigh heels, He Zhonggui in a checkered sports coat and a red paisley tie.\nThey stand out from the other passengers, most of whom are peasants\nreturning from market with empty rattan baskets and blue pockets full of\nmoney.\nHe Zhonggui’s parents were from peasant families on the mountain, and\nas a child he spent much time there, but now he rarely returns. He is the\nowner of a Fuling construction company, and there is little building to be\ndone on the steep slopes of White Flat Mountain. But his parents are buried\nthere, and the Day of Pure Brightness is a Chinese holiday of remembrance,\nof visits to rural graves in places like White Flat Mountain, where stone\ntombs stare silent and unblinking at the river valley and its breathless spring.\nHe Zhonggui is accompanied by a clan of fifteen people—aunts and\nuncles, cousins and nieces and nephews, ranging from old women in their\nsixties to a baby of fifteen months. The group disembarks on the northern\nbank and makes its way eastward along the Yangtze’s rocky shore.\nSomewhere in the middle of the clan is Dai Mei, He Zhonggui’s fourteen-\nyear-old niece. She is a talker—a bundle of energy in brown corduroy\noveralls and short bobbed hair, chatting constantly as she bounces from stone\n\nto stone.\nA few miles downstream, a slender white pagoda rises above the horizon,\nits distant shape shadowy and bright like a mirage in the late-morning mist.\n“Do you know why they built those?” Dai Mei asks. “They believed that a\ndragon was there, under the earth, and they believed that if they built the\npagoda he would stay there. But if it ever falls down, the dragon will come\nout.”\nShe pauses, looks up the hill, flicks her glossy black hair, and, like\nfourteen-year-old girls the world over, changes the topic with mind-numbing\nfluency. “My grandparents’ tombs are up there. Some of the peasants are\nburied down here on the lower part, but most are up high. They wanted a\nplace with good fengshui, and they thought it was better higher up. They\nchose the spots themselves. Often they asked a Daoist priest to help, and the\npriest told them whether a place had good fengshui or not. In fact, the priest\nonly cheated them—it’s just superstition. But even today many of the\npeasants still believe in fengshui, just like everybody used to. Our generation,\nthough, doesn’t believe in this kind of thing. We know it’s jiade, fake—it’s\nonly superstition. We believe in science, and we say things like that are\nfeudal ideas.”\nLike many young Chinese, whose instinctive rejection of all things\ntraditional has been more than amply complemented by school lessons, she\nuses “feudal” the way an American child would use “backward.” One of her\ncommon refrains is that China is “too feudal,” and on another occasion she\ncomplains vehemently about the older generation: “People in our China,\nespecially people in their sixties and seventies, are very, very, very feudal! If\nyou want to wear a short skirt, or a blouse that’s like this on your shoulders,\nthey’ll say it’s not proper. My mother isn’t feudal—she wears short skirts,\ntoo, because she looks very young. But my father is very, very, very feudal!\nWe call people like that Lao Fengjian—Old Feudal.”\nToday she keeps such ideas to herself. She says that she has no faith in\nfengshui or Buddhism, but she shrugs. “On a day like the Day of Pure\nBrightness,” she says, “we’ll do things the way our parents and the older\npeople want us to do them. We’ll go to our grandparents’ tombs and pray and\nburn incense, and we’ll act like we believe in all of it. But in our hearts we\ndon’t believe.”\n\nFIREWORKS EXPLODE ON THE SUMMIT, the sound echoing back\nand forth across the river valley, and the family slowly climbs the slope of\nWhite Flat Mountain. They follow narrow switchbacks of rough stone steps;\nthe pace slows; their breath comes in gasps. This is by far the steepest\nmountain in the Fuling area, and the only one that is actually something more\nthan a hill—even Raise the Flag Mountain, with its staircases of rice paddies\nand crop terraces, is too gradual to be considered a true mountain.\nMost of the south face of White Flat Mountain is too steep for terracing,\nand pines grow thick along its summit, above a rocky wall that falls away\nsheer for more than a hundred feet. This limestone cliff is possibly the origin\nof the mountain’s name—although, like so many other names in this part of\nSichuan, the truth has been lost in the past. Indeed, many locals say that the\nname is actually North Flat Mountain. In the local dialect both “white” and\n“north” are pronounced the same way—bei—and the confusion is heightened\nby some Fuling maps using “North Flat Mountain” while others refer to\n“White Flat Mountain.” In a region where literacy has only recently become\ncommon, names were spoken long before they were written down, and in the\nend the spoken word is still all that matters. You pronounce it bei.\nThe family climbs to the east of the cliff wall, where the slope is more\ngradual, and after thirty minutes they come to the home of He Zhonggui’s\ncousin. He is a peasant who lives above the mountain’s initial rise, and\neverybody stops to rest here on the edge of his threshing platform, in the\nshade of the farmhouse’s tiled eaves. For peasants, the threshing platform is\nthe center of home life—this is where grain is threshed, spices are dried,\nvegetables are cut, grandchildren are raised, visitors are served tea. And this\nparticular platform, perched high above the river, has a view whose\nmagnificence quiets today’s guests.\nBelow them is spread all the mountain’s layered scenery, with all its\ntextures and colors: the green terraced fields of wheat, split into neat rows;\nthe plots of rapeseed, their buds a wild tangle of yellow glory; the soft-\nflowered paulownias, rising above gray-roofed houses; the great Yangtze\nglinting silver in the sun; and, across the river, the hazy pagoda shimmering\nslender and white in the distance. A light breeze brushes the nearby rows of\nyoung wheat. The temperature in the shade is perfect.\n\nThe peasant and his wife serve tea. The guests chat; the breeze blows.\nThe tea cools. After a polite amount of time has been spent, the clan files out\nbehind the house to the back fields, past a massive old tomb.\nNobody knows the name of the family that is buried here. “Qing\nDynasty,” the locals say, when asked when the tomb was built. But in Fuling\nthis is the standard response to almost any question about old tombs, ancient\nhouses, or other relics whose origins have been lost in the rush of the last\ncentury. “Qing Dynasty,” the people always say knowingly. They realize it’s\na safe guess—the Qing ruled for nearly three centuries, from 1644 to 1911.\nParadise Lost is Qing Dynasty, and the American Revolution is Qing\nDynasty, and the most recent Chicago Cubs World Championship is Qing\nDynasty. When people in Fuling say Qing Dynasty, often what they seem to\nmean is: It’s very old, but not as old as many other things.\nThey know that this is a landlord’s tomb, because it is easily five times\nthe size of the other graves in the area. The tomb is fifteen feet high, set into\nthe side of the mountain, and nine rows of corn have been planted on its\nearth-covered back. Nearby, a dark stand of bamboo rustles and creaks in the\nwind. Stone carvings decorate the tomb’s face, and several figures have had\ntheir heads knocked off—vandalism, perhaps from the Cultural Revolution.\nAnd maybe this was also when the family name was removed. But most of\nthe stone face is remarkably intact, and an inscription reads, in part:\nMay the orchids and laurels give sweetness to your heart\nMay your descendants find success\nAnd may your soul be at peace.\nLooking at such a tomb, one can only imagine the typical fate of a\nlandlord’s descendants: the post-Liberation executions, exiles, struggle\nsessions, reeducation camps. Probably the scions of this landlord did not find\nthe success he imagined—but this is only a guess. All that is certain is that\nthe tomb has no name, and here in the bamboo’s shade there are no orchids,\nand today on the Day of Pure Brightness there are no descendants paying\ntheir respects. Nearby, the family chatter as they offer paper money at the\ngraves of He Zhonggui’s father and uncle. But this massive tomb has no\n\nofferings other than the young corn along its back, and all is silent except for\nthe mysterious devotion of the wind among the creaking stalks of bamboo.\nHE ZHONGGUI’S FATHER AND UNCLE are buried side by side, a pair\nof solid limestone tombs facing south and east toward the Yangtze and the\nworld beyond. The visitors have walked single-file through wheat fields to\nthe graves, careful not to trample the young green stalks, and now they light\nfat red candles and burn piles of paper money.\nThe bills, which are in denominations of $800 million, say “Bank of\nHeaven” on the front. They are legal tender in the next world. The money\ncrumples into black balls of ash as the fire flickers and gasps. The candles\ndance in the Yangtze wind. Waves of heat come and go as the flames rise and\nfall.\nThe old women kowtow and pray before the burning money. After they\nfinish, the children take their turns, urged on by their elders. They giggle and\nsloppily kowtow three times, kneeling on strips of paper so their trousers and\ndresses won’t get dirty, and then they close their eyes and pray, sometimes\naloud. “Please help me do well on my examinations,” murmurs Dai Mei’s\ncousin, a sixteen-year-old boy in glasses.\nAfterward, the group files back through the wheat, but three young men\nstay behind. For most of the ritual they have hung back, tolerant but cool and\nuninterested; they are in their twenties, and the Day of Pure Brightness is not\na young man’s holiday. But now they clamber up and stand on the graves,\nholding cigarettes and long strands of fireworks, and then they light the fuses.\nGhosts and evil spirits scatter as the fireworks explode. The children clap\nand scream; the old people hold their ears and turn away. The young men\nremain calm—the fireworks erupt in a deafening roar, but each man holds the\nexploding string in hand until the flame leaps nearly to his fingers, and then,\nnonchalantly, he drops the strand and lights another. They do not plug their\nears. They do not laugh or grimace. They make no expression at all;\noutwardly they are completely cool. But something in their eyes cannot be\ncontrolled, flashing with the sheer exhilaration of standing on the tomb while\nall the scenes and sounds of the holiday suddenly converge on this spot: the\nthrobbing explosions, the heavy smell of gunpowder, the swirling dust and",

          "text": "cloying song, but like so many of the bad music programs on television it had\na sort of fatal attraction—I always watched it to the bitter end. The song’s\nconclusion featured representative minorities dancing on the Great Wall,\ndressed in traditional costumes as they sang about how much they loved their\nChina. Every time I watched it, I thought: Your China built that wall to keep\nyou people out.\nIt seemed there was always something of this sort on television—at\nvirtually any hour of the day you could find a channel that was focusing on\nsome happy minority, usually the Tibetans. This kind of entertainment struck\nme as uniquely hypocritical, at least until the next year when I returned home\nfrom China and tutored at a public elementary school in Missouri, where the\nchildren celebrated Thanksgiving with traditional stories about the wonderful\nfriendship between the Pilgrims and the Indians. I realized that these myths\nwere a sort of link between America and China—both countries were\narrogant enough to twist some of their greatest failures into sources of pride.\nAnd now that I thought about it, I remembered seeing Indians dance more\nthan a few times on American television.\nBut just like Thanksgiving, the Great Wall had outgrown its original\nsignificance and now it simply meant greatness.

            "cloying song, but like so many of the bad music programs on television it had\na sort of fatal attraction—I always watched it to the bitter end. The song’s\nconclusion featured representative minorities dancing on the Great Wall,\ndressed in traditional costumes as they sang about how much they loved their\nChina. Every time I watched it, I thought: Your China built that wall to keep\nyou people out.\nIt seemed there was always something of this sort on television—at\nvirtually any hour of the day you could find a channel that was focusing on\nsome happy minority, usually the Tibetans. This kind of entertainment struck\nme as uniquely hypocritical, at least until the next year when I returned home\nfrom China and tutored at a public elementary school in Missouri, where the\nchildren celebrated Thanksgiving with traditional stories about the wonderful\nfriendship between the Pilgrims and the Indians. I realized that these myths\nwere a sort of link between America and China—both countries were\narrogant enough to twist some of their greatest failures into sources of pride.\nAnd now that I thought about it, I remembered seeing Indians dance more\nthan a few times on American television.\nBut just like Thanksgiving, the Great Wall had outgrown its original\nsignificance and now it simply meant greatness.

His daughter had just graduated from the\nChinese department of Yulin Teachers College. They were friendly, well-\neducated people, and during the week I spent in Yulin I went to their home\nevery day. Often they served me a late breakfast, and after eating we would\nsit with tea and watermelon in the shade of their living room.\nLuo Xiaolei had spent five years in prison during the Cultural Revolution,\nbecause he was an intellectual and a Christian, and his father had been exiled\nto ten years of labor in a remote part of the desert. The old man didn’t say\nmuch about that experience, except that the work was difficult and served no\npurpose. That was often the way people described their exiles—the wasted\ntime was the worst part.\nI found it easy to speak openly with the Luos, because their experiences\nhad made them skeptical, and because soon I would leave this place. That\nwas the best part of traveling—I wasn’t really accountable for things I did\nand said; I could wander off with anybody and talk about anything I wanted.\nIt wasn’t like living in Fuling, where people kept track of me and there was\nalways the knowledge that I still had another year left in the river town.

            "The old man’s son was named Luo Xiaolei; he was in his mid-forties and\nhe edited a local literary magazine. His daughter had just graduated from the\nChinese department of Yulin Teachers College. They were friendly, well-\neducated people, and during the week I spent in Yulin I went to their home\nevery day. Often they served me a late breakfast, and after eating we would\nsit with tea and watermelon in the shade of their living room.\nLuo Xiaolei had spent five years in prison during the Cultural Revolution,\nbecause he was an intellectual and a Christian, and his father had been exiled\nto ten years of labor in a remote part of the desert. The old man didn’t say\nmuch about that experience, except that the work was difficult and served no\npurpose. That was often the way people described their exiles—the wasted\ntime was the worst part.\nI found it easy to speak openly with the Luos, because their experiences\nhad made them skeptical, and because soon I would leave this place. That\nwas the best part of traveling—I wasn’t really accountable for things I did\nand said; I could wander off with anybody and talk about anything I wanted.\nIt wasn’t like living in Fuling, where people kept track of me and there was\nalways the knowledge that I still had another year left in the river town. There\nwere many good things about having a home in China, but that was one of\nthe drawbacks.\nOne afternoon, Luo Xiaolei asked me what I thought about teaching in\nChina, and I realized that it was a difficult question.\n“Mostly I like it very much,” I said, “and especially I like the students.

There were often schedules like this for the\nyoung Chinese I knew; they were pragmatists about love as well as politics\nand nearly everything else.

He saw that I was jotting in my notebook, but unlike most people he\ndidn’t ask what I was writing, probably because he guessed the truth. Usually\nI told people that it was my diary, or sometimes I simply said, “I’m writing\nmy foreign language.” That was enough to satisfy nearly everyone—if you\nknew a foreign language, it was obvious that you would spend a great deal of\ntime writing it. Nobody seemed to realize that in fact I was writing about\nthem and everything else around me, but the man from Hebei watched my\npen skim impulsively over the pages and I sensed that he knew that he was\nbeing described. But he still spoke freely; we talked lightly about politics,\nand the Communist Party, and I asked him if he was a member.\n“No,” he said. “I don’t want to be.”\n“Why not?”\n“Too much trouble. My friends—and most young people—all of us are\nthe same. We’re not interested in that. It’s not the same as your America. We\nonly have one party in our China.”\nThe differences between these countries interested him. “All Chinese like\nAmericans,” he said, a while later. “But many Americans think there are\nproblems with human rights here. In fact, Old Hundred Names doesn’t care\nabout that. Old Hundred Names worries about eating, about having enough\nclothes. Look out there.”\nHe pointed out the window—a dusty village, garbage beside the tracks, a\nskinny donkey followed by a peasant in blue. Old Hundred Names.\n“Do you think people like that worry about democracy?” he said. “They\nneed to improve their living standard and then they can start thinking about\nother things. That’s the problem with America and China—you can’t\ncompare them in the same breath.”\nWe slipped away from politics; he talked of marriage and how after three\nmore years he would find a wife. There were often schedules like this for the\nyoung Chinese I knew; they were pragmatists about love as well as politics\nand nearly everything else. The young man explained his reasons—in three\nyears he would be twenty-eight years old, which was neither too old nor too\nyoung, and by then he should have enough money to get married. It took a\ngreat deal of money to marry, he said, and it wasn’t something you wanted to\ndo in a place like Xinjiang. In three years he hoped to live in Hebei, or"

They weren’t oases in the romantic sense: no palms or shining\npools of water; just concrete and dust and glass. It was as if the oases and the\ndesert had been reversed; we would roll out of town and I would breathe a\nsigh of relief, unable to imagine that once these places had been inviting to\ntravellers. The land was barren but it was also mesmerizing, and the towns\nhad no charm."

Like most of my friends in Fuling, she\nwatched an enormous amount of television, and one day she came to class\nparticularly interested in what she had seen.\n“Last night there was a waiguoren on television,” she said, “He was\nspeaking Chinese.”\n“Was it Da Shan?”\n“No, it wasn’t Da Shan; his Chinese wasn’t nearly as good as Da Shan’s.\nHis Chinese wasn’t as good as yours.”\n“That can’t be true.”\n“Actually, his grammar was better than yours, but his pronunciation was\nworse. His tones were bad.”\n“I don’t believe it.”\n“I’m not kidding,” she said. “I think your Chinese is better than that of\nthe waiguoren who was on television. And if you improved your grammar, it\nwould be much better.”\n“Where was he from?”\n“Australia. He was very ugly—he had bad skin and very long hair. He\nwas extremely hard to look at.”\nFor a moment we sat there, silent in our shared distaste for the longhaired\nwaiguoren with bad tones on television. Then we started class, and Teacher\nLiao paid particularly close attention to my grammar.\nAfter that she kept me updated on the waiguoren who appeared on\ntelevision. For the most part it was a small and select group, with Da Shan as\nthe mainstay, and all of the regulars were very good at Chinese—it was clear\nthat I still had years to go before I could enter that league. But Teacher Liao\napparently felt that there was hope, and occasionally a waiguoren with tone\nproblems would appear and she would criticize him mercilessly. Always she"

Virtually all educated Chinese recognized the\nallusion, and there were subsequent writers who had used the two characters\nin other poems. Suddenly, Adam went from pig feed to a noble-sounding\nclassical allusion—that was how easily a waiguoren could redefine himself in\nChina.\nI never changed my Chinese name, but I sensed the ease with which my\nChinese identity became distinct from my American self. Eventually, I came\nto think of myself as two people, Ho Wei and Peter Hessler. Ho Wei wasn’t\nreally a person until my second year in Fuling, but as time passed I realized\nthat he was becoming most of my identity: apart from my students,\ncolleagues, and the other foreigners, everybody knew me strictly as Ho Wei,\nand they knew me strictly in Chinese. Ho Wei was completely different from\nmy American self: he was friendlier, he was eager to talk with anybody, and\nhe took great pleasure in even the most inane conversations. In a simple way\nhe was funny; by saying a few words in the local dialect he could be\nendlessly entertaining to the people in Fuling. Also Ho Wei was stupid,"

        "smoke and sunshine, the long streak of the Yangtze far below like a dragon\nbasking in the sudden roar of the valley.\nTHE PROCESSION CONTINUES UP THE MOUNTAIN, past green\nrows of broad beans, past waist-high wheat, past another steep ridge of short\nterraces and winding stone paths. The Yangtze is still visible to the south.\nFireworks echo in the distance. The family continues to the tomb of He\nZhonggui’s mother, who is buried farther up White Flat Mountain, in a plot a\nfew minutes away from the grave of her husband. She died thirty years after\nhim, and perhaps she had different ideas about the fengshui of the mountain.\nIn those days it was not uncommon for a couple to be buried separately.\nA tablet on the front of her tomb is engraved with five large characters:\nLi Chengyu, Mother of He. Below this title are two neat columns of names.\n“See, those are her descendants,” Dai Mei says, when she comes close to\npay her respects. “The women are on the left and the men on the right. And\nthere’s my name!”\nShe reaches out and touches the very last name on the list. Between Dai\nMei’s name and the name of her grandmother are more than a dozen others.\nSome of them have also come today to pay their respects, while others live\ntoo far away. Still others have died themselves. But everybody has been\naccounted for on the tablet. Dai Mei runs her finger over the engraved strokes\nof her name, and then she says, simply, “That’s me.”\nIN LATE AFTERNOON the family returns down the mountain. They have\neaten lunch on another cousin’s threshing platform, and now they take their\ntime going home, stopping occasionally to enjoy the scenery.\nBut He Zhonggui has no great love for the land. To most outsiders, the\nfields seem beautiful and romantic, but his parents lived here, and the\nmountain represents a hard life that he is happy and proud to have left behind.\nHe stops to rest halfway down the hillside, and staring out at the Yangtze he\nspeaks softly. “I grew up in the city,” he says. “Not here in the countryside.\nBut we were still poor; my father worked on the docks. At fifteen, I went to\nwork, too. I went all alone, and I worked in construction. I was just a",
        "common worker. I was the same age as her.”\nHe points at Dai Mei, and for a moment it seems that he will continue the\nstory, but he falls silent. He is not a great talker, and perhaps the tale has\nalready been told too many times.\nIn any case, its trajectory is clear. It can be seen in everything about him\n—his clothes, his confidence, his cellular phone, which has rung several\ntimes during today’s rituals. And the tale can also be seen in his home, a\nthree-story building that he has constructed in the heart of downtown Fuling.\nAll of the residents are his relatives—a daughter on this floor, a brother on\nthat landing, another brother in between. The apartments are ranged around\nan open-air courtyard, and the family members can easily call out to each\nother across floors. The apartments themselves are spacious and equipped\nwith top-of-the-line VCD players and karaoke machines. The ceilings are\ndecorated with faux-jeweled light fixtures, baroque patterns of plaster detail,\nand velvet tapestries of deep red and purple. From the roof, which has a green\nfish pond and an orange tree, one can look over Fuling’s tiled roofs to the\nYangtze River and the fields of White Flat Mountain.\nThere are very few private cars in Fuling, but He Zhonggui owns a brand-\nnew Red Flag sedan. He likes to point out that this is the same type of car that\ntransported Mao Zedong and Deng Xiaoping. He Zhonggui drives the car\nhimself, and later today he will drive it slowly and lovingly across town to\nthe East River district. He will drive past an apartment building that he\nrecently constructed, which he will point out with quiet pride. It is a massive\nuptown building of white tile and blue glass, the same kind of structure that is\nspringing up without distinction all over China. The car will slow as it passes\nthe building, and He Zhonggui will turn on the air-conditioning and ask, “Is it\ncool enough back there?”\nBut this is later. First he leads his clan back down the twisted stone path\nof White Flat Mountain, and at its foot he buys ice cream for everybody as\nthey wait for the ferry. They eat their ice cream on the pebbled shore of the\nYangtze. Above them, the mountain grows quiet; today’s fireworks are\nfinished. A breeze runs east through the valley. The pagoda is clear now in\nthe afternoon sun. The family finishes their ice cream, and, laughing, they\nwash their hands in the spring river.",
        "CHAPTER SIX",
        "Storm\nIN THE BEGINNING OF MAY there was a fire high in the mountains east\nof Fuling. For weeks it had been hot—hot and hazy, bright blurry days with\ntemperatures in the nineties. Ribbons of dust hung above the unpaved roads\nbehind campus, and the air was heavy with the heat. Everybody told me that\nthe spring rains had been too infrequent, and then the fire broke out on Two\nViews Mountain.\nThe mountain was the highest in the area; from its summit on a clear day\nyou could see both Fuling and Fengdu. There were forests up there, as well as\nsmall farms, and the fire burned out of control. Nobody knew how it had\nstarted. There was a hot dry wind coming off the Yangtze and it swept the\nflames across the mountain.\nOn the first night of the fire they took fifty student volunteers from the\ncollege to fight it, and the following morning another two hundred went.\nFrom my balcony I watched the second group gather in the front plaza. All of\nthem were boys, dressed in their military training uniforms, and they laughed\nand chattered excitedly as they waited to leave. Buses took the volunteers\naway and the campus was quiet again.\nThat day the sun was a hot dull disk in the sky and smoke filtered down\nfrom the mountains. I could smell it from my balcony. Many of the boys\nwere gone from my classes, and as the day passed I wondered how they were\ndoing up on Two Views Mountain. The girls were distracted and classes did\nnot go well.\nLater I was studying in my bedroom when I saw black clouds fill the\nwestern sky across the Wu River. A sudden wind began to blow papers off\nmy desk. I closed the window and took my laundry off the line, and then I\nwent through my apartment and fastened all the windows and doors. The\nstorm was close now, swelling dark behind the city, and I could hardly shut\nmy living-room windows against the force of the wind.",
        "I turned off the lights and put new batteries in my flashlight. I went out to\nmy glassed-in kitchen balcony just as the rain was starting. It fell in sharp\ndiagonal streaks, the wind growing even stronger, and the branches of the\ntrees bent angrily. Across the courtyard, the windows of the teaching building\nshattered as they blew shut, and the students shouted and screamed. They\nalways yelled in excitement whenever the big storms came, and sometimes\nthey forgot to fasten the windows. In spring the landings were often full of\nbroken glass from the storms.\nI heard more glass shattering down in the East River district, where\npeople scurried across the streets. On the western flank of Raise the Flag\nMountain there was a sudden blue flash, followed by an explosion, and then\nall the lights in Fuling went out.\nI watched the storm from my balcony. Clouds rolled in low over the\nmountains and the rain fell harder. The sky darkened and then suddenly\nflared white, as if somebody had scratched an enormous match against the\nquick-moving clouds. A tangle of lightning illuminated the peak of White\nFlat Mountain. For an instant the summit loomed high above the Yangtze,\nfrozen in the electric flash, but then the mountain disappeared as thunder rang\nthrough the angry sky. Soon the rain brought a mist over the rivers, until at\nlast the Yangtze was invisible and the Wu was only a flat streak of gray that\nblended smoothly into the unknown horizon.\nAfter half an hour the heavy storm was finished. The hills looked green\nagain; the dust and smoke had been rinsed from the air. It rained lightly\nthroughout the evening. The next day my students returned from the hills,\nand it turned out that the storm had put out the fire before they even made it\nto the mountain. But the trip had been a break from the routine, and they were\njust as excited to return as they had been to leave.\nTWO WEEKS LATER, the college had a three-day track meet in the new\nstadium that had been constructed in the shadow of Raise the Flag Mountain.\nMost Chinese schools had sports days in the spring, but ours was especially\nbig that year because of the new athletic complex, and because Hong Kong\nwould return in a month and a half.\nEverything that semester had to do with Hong Kong, just as everything in",
        "the fall had been related to the Long March. There was a spring examination\ncontest about Hong Kong’s economics, and the Party Members wore special\nHong Kong pins that distinguished them from the other students. A\n“Welcome Back Hong Kong” sign decorated the entrance to the library, and\nevery day they changed the numbers to show how many days it was until the\ncolony returned to the Motherland. Sometimes I asked my students how\nmany days were left, and they always knew the exact number.\nThey spent weeks preparing for the track meet. The serious athletes\ntrained on the old athletic grounds beside the cafeteria, and everybody\npracticed for the parade that would precede the event. The boys worked on\ntheir goose-step military marches while the girls prepared elaborate flag\ndances, and during their Sunday-night political meetings they sang songs\nabout Hong Kong.\nThe opening ceremonies for the competition were held in a downpour.\nThe Hong Kong banners drooped sadly, and the brightly colored helium\nballoons refused to rise. But the celebration continued: the students, more\nthan a thousand of them, slogged grimly along the muddy track, and they\nwore tight faces as they did their dances in the pouring rain. Nearly all of the\nspectators left, and the cadres, who huddled under the overhang in the center\nof the stands, shivered as they reviewed the marching. Next week all of my\nclasses were full of coughs and sniffles.\nThe athletic competitions were postponed for two days, and then the\nweather improved and the meet went off without a hitch. Classes were\ncanceled, and the students were seated around the stadium according to\ndepartment. It was a serious competition. All of the girls’ events over four\nhundred meters in length ended in every single competitor collapsing at the\nfinish, and before their races the runners carefully recruited groups of friends\nto carry them away after it was over. In a way it was touching, like a soldier\nwriting a farewell note home before going into battle. A girl would give her\nfriends clear instructions, and then after the race she would collapse in their\narms and be carried out of the stadium gates, gasping and crying—exit stage\nright, a curious form of Sichuan opera. In the boys’ races it was less common,\nbut still about a quarter of the runners collapsed at the finish. Friends helped\nthe boys to the department aid tables, where they were given hot tea and\nMagnificent Sound cigarettes. After five minutes they were fine.\nI was scheduled to run the 1500 meters, the 5000 meters, and the 4×100-",
        "meter relay. Faculty members had their own teams, and there were special\nraces for the retired teachers, who ran hard but never collapsed at the finish.\nBecause I had won the Fuling road race, I was entered in the student\ncompetition, and this spectacle—the foreign teacher going head to head\nagainst the students—was enough to work the crowd into a frenzy. They\npressed close along the finish area, until only the first two lanes were open,\nand my own students lined the backstretch. Huang Xiaoqiang, the owner of\nthe noodle restaurant where I usually ate lunch, came onto campus with his\nson to cheer for me.\nThe other runners were excited about competing against the waiguoren\nand they started too fast, the roar of the spectators in their ears. But from the\nbeginning I could tell that it was a different crowd from the January road\nrace; I heard voices calling my own name, both in English and Chinese, and\nthe English department students cheered as I steadily came from behind. I\nwon both races easily, and at the end of the 1500, when my students gathered\nto greet me at the finish, I felt more like a member of the department than a\nwaiguoren. It was the same way in the sprint relay, in which the distance was\ntoo short to give me an advantage and I ran the second leg without\ndistinction. Party Secretary Zhang anchored our faculty team, sprinting past\nthe Chinese department in the homestretch, and all of the English students\ncheered madly. Afterward the four of us posed for pictures with Raise the\nFlag Mountain in the background, and Party Secretary Zheng beamed and lit\na cigarette.\nBut during the 5000 meters the physical education students in the crowd\nstarted taunting me, shouting “Hahlllooo!” and “Yangguizi!” as I went by.\nYangguizi meant “foreign devil,” and they quieted down after some of my\nstudents scolded them, but I still heard their mocking cries, and in response I\nput my head down and ran hard for the last mile. It was unnecessary to do\nthat—I was already winning and I could feel a cold coming on. But I couldn’t\nhelp it; in a race that was the only way I would ever react to being taunted.\nI returned home to discover that I had a fever of 102 degrees. I realized\nhow foolish it had been to run the 5000 meters hard, and I saw that there was\nnothing much good about competing in events like that. I was too competitive\nand the locals were even worse; no matter how much things improved,\ninevitably it seemed to come down to me against everybody else. I decided\nthat it was more enjoyable to watch than to run, and after that I never raced",
        "again.\nALL THROUGH THE COURSE OF THAT SEMESTER, my health\ngrew steadily worse. A few times I ran a fever, but mostly I was developing\nchronic sinus problems from the pollution, and I was always on antibiotics. It\nwas a strange time, because despite the health problems I had never been so\nsatisfied with life in Fuling. I was growing comfortable in the city, and I was\nstarting to make friends who spoke no English. My Chinese life was\ndeveloping and now I sensed that in the second year everything would be\nbetter.\nEven my classes with Teacher Liao had become markedly less tense. It\nwas as if our Opium Wars had allowed each of us to see the other clearly,\nalbeit in very brief flashes of contrary opinions, but the honesty of these\nviewpoints seemed to matter more than their substance. To some degree I\nknew where she stood—she had definite suspicions about waiguoren and\ntheir views on China, but she was open enough to make these suspicions\nclear. Increasingly I was inclined to see this as a welcome change from the\nEnglish department cadres, who smiled and treated me kindly but never\ndropped their guard. Teacher Liao at least respected me enough to provide\nglimpses of her viewpoints, and I sensed that she saw me in a similar light—a\nwaiguoren who didn’t always respect China but was at least willing to talk\nabout it. Our Opium Wars didn’t end in victory or loss; rather they quietly\nslipped away, and increasingly I enjoyed my classes.\nBut at the same time part of me was starting to wear thin, both physically\nand psychologically, and I knew that I needed time away from the pressures\nof living in a small place like Fuling. Adam was the same way, and as the\nsemester wound down there was something grim about the way we pushed\nonward. The term was scheduled to end just after Hong Kong returned to\nChina, on midnight of June 30, and after that we would be free to travel and\nstudy Chinese.\nI had first sensed the magnitude of Hong Kong’s return during the first\nterm, when I asked one of my third-year classes to write about the happiest\nday of their lives. Most of them responded as I had expected—they described\nthe day when they received their admission notice to the college. Don, who",
        "was from a particularly poor part of the Fengdu countryside, wrote:\nOn that day, I got up very early. As soon as I had breakfast, I went to\nthe post office very quickly. I was very eager to see my score of entering\ncollege. The postman saw me coming toward him, so he shouted at me,\n“congratulations! This is your admission book.” I caught it from his\nhand. I lifted it above my head. I shouted without consciousness, “I have\nsucceeded at last!” At that time my happy tears came out of my eyes.\nThis is the result that I worked hard for fifteen years. During fifteen\nyears, I had studied very hard all the time. As a son of farmer, I wanted\nto go out of the countryside. It is the only way that I study harder than\nthe people in city or town. I didn’t disappoint the heavy expectation my\nparents and relatives had given. It was a turning point in my life. I can\nenter college to study a lot of knowledge. Thirty-first August 1994, I\nwill never forget you. You are my happiest day of my life. You are what\nI got with my sweat and blood.\nProbably three-quarters of the responses were of this sort, and they made\nfor pleasant reading: I saw the way that education was making a difference in\nmy students’ lives, and I was a small part of that process. But I was less\ninspired by the two students who wrote that the happiest day of their lives\nhadn’t happened yet, because it would be when Hong Kong returned to\nChina. One of them, whose English name was Peace, wrote:\nI’m sure that the day of July 1st, 1997 is my happiest day. On that day\nall of us Chinese will be cheerful and happy. Because the day of July 1st\n1997 is very especial day for us. Hong Kong will be restored to China\non that day, this shows accomplishment of the great cause of\nreunification in China. All of us know that the return of Hong Kong to\nthe motherland and China’s resumption of the exercise of sovereignity\nare a firm position and are not negotiable. Of course, I am happiest on\nthat day.",
        "As the semester progressed, I was struck by how all of the political\nclasses and special events had made the return of Hong Kong a personal\nevent in the lives of my students. Ostensibly, of course, my subject matter\nhad nothing to do with Chinese politics, but it was inevitable that\noccasionally we drifted in that direction. For literature class we studied Kate\nChopin’s short story “Désirée’s Baby,” which led us into discussions about\nracism. We talked about the situation of blacks in America, and the issue of\ninterracial marriage, and the students asked me if there were any prejudices\nand stereotypes about Chinese people in America. I told them that current\nstereotypes often had to do with Chinese-Americans being overserious\nstudents, but I mentioned that in the nineteenth century many Westerners had\nbelieved that the Chinese were weak and incompetent.\n“Why was that?” one of the students asked.\n“Well, I guess it was because of the Opium Wars,” I said.\n“What do you mean?”\n“You know what happened in the Opium Wars,” I said. “At that time,\nChina wasn’t a very powerful nation, and it wasn’t difficult for the foreign\ncountries to defeat the Chinese armies. As a result, many of the foreigners\nbelieved that the Chinese people were weak. This idea changed later, of\ncourse, but at that time it was a common prejudice.”\nAfter I spoke there was silence and the students stared at their desks. That\nwas always what happened when you broke a taboo—there was an instant\nhush and you found yourself looking at forty-five circles of black hair as the\nstudents dropped their heads. They had done the same thing a week earlier,\nduring another discussion on racism, when I had said gently that I thought\nracism and xenophobia were problems everywhere, even in China.\n“There is no prejudice or racism in China,” Wendy said quickly, and I\ncould see that she was offended. She was one of the best students, as well as\none of the most patriotic.\n“I don’t think it’s that simple,” I said. “Why is it that people often shout\nat Mr. Meier and me when we go to Fuling City?”\n“They are being friendly,” Wendy said. “They just want to talk with you,\nbut they aren’t educated. They aren’t trying to be rude.”\n“Sometimes I’ve had children throw things at me,” I said. “That doesn’t\nseem very friendly.”\n“They are only children!”",
        "“But their parents just laughed and did nothing to stop them,” I said. “I’m\nnot saying that this is such a terrible thing, but I don’t think racism and bad\nbehavior toward foreigners are issues only in America. These problems could\nbe improved in China as well.”\nThe students dropped their heads and there was an uncomfortable silence.\nI realized that this was something we couldn’t talk about, and quickly I\nchanged the subject back to “Désirée’s Baby” and American racism. As a\nforeign teacher you learned to respond to the moments when the heads\nbowed, and mostly you learned that it was impossible to criticize China in\nany way. But I was still surprised to see that a week later my reference to the\nOpium Wars touched this same sensitivity.\nIt was especially odd considering that earlier in the semester, during our\nunit on “Rip Van Winkle,” they had shown no sensitivity whatsoever with\nregard to more recent periods in Chinese history. My assignment had been to\nperform skits about a Chinese Rip Van Winkle; each group had to write and\nperform a story from a different period. One of them was about a Chinese\nman who had gone to sleep in 1930 and woken up in 1950, and another\nspanned 1948 to 1968, and so on. Among the seven groups it was a capsule\nof twentieth-century Chinese history, and I was especially curious to see how\nthe group assigned to the Cultural Revolution would depict such a painful\nperiod.\nIn their skit, Rip was played by Aumur, an owlish boy with thick glasses\nand short black hair. He woke up confused, and soon the other students in the\ngroup, who were Red Guards, put a dunce cap on his head. They wrapped a\nCAPITALIST ROADER sign around his neck, and they tied his hands\nbehind his back. Roughly they forced him to his knees before the class. The\nRed Guards crowded around and then the struggle session began.\n“Why aren’t you a Red Guard?” one of the girls shouted at him.\n“What’s a Red Guard?” Aumur asked, confused.\n“You know what a Red Guard is! Why are you a Capitalist Roader?”\n“I don’t know what you are talking about. What’s a Capitalist Roader?\nMy name is Rip Van Winkle and I’m a loyal soldier in the Kuomintang\narmy.”\n“What did you say?”\n“I’m a loyal soldier in Chiang Kai-shek’s Kuomintang army. I’m just a\npoor man—”",
        "“A Counter-Revolutionary! He’s a Counter-Revolutionary!”\n“My name is Rip Van Winkle and I’m just a—”\n“Shut your mouth!” the girl screamed. “Now you will do the airplane!”\nTwo of them forced him to a standing position, pulling his arms back.\nThe other students beat spoons against metal bowls and shouted as they\nmarched back and forth. I watched from the back of the room, hoping\ndesperately that Dean Fu wouldn’t happen to walk past my class and poke his\nhead inside. I didn’t want to explain how “Rip Van Winkle” had taken us to\nthis point.\nThe strangest part was that the class loved it—by far it was the most\npopular of all the skits, and the audience cheered and laughed. This wasn’t at\nall what I had expected; I had thought that they would find a way to perform\na tactful skit that avoided the uglier aspects of that period, because I knew\nthat many of the students had parents who had suffered during the Cultural\nRevolution. But I never would have guessed it from watching them; nobody\nseemed upset, and the skit was as hilarious as A Midsummer Night’s Dream\nor any other comedy. It was similar to what the Chinese writer Lu Xun once\nremarked: “People with good memories are liable to be crushed by the weight\nof suffering. Only those with bad memories, the fittest to survive, can live\non.”\nBut my students’ memories weren’t uniformly bad. Although they joked\nabout the Cultural Revolution, they were incredibly sensitive about the\nOpium Wars. I knew that part of this sensitivity stemmed from my being a\nforeigner, but there was also a degree to which time had been turned around\nin their eyes, until events of the mid-1800s were more immediate and\nunresolved than the struggles of their parents’ generation. Chinese history\nbooks deemphasized the Cultural Revolution, and the issue of Mao Zedong’s\nexcesses was neatly handled by Deng Xiaoping’s judgment that the Chairman\nhad been 70 percent correct and 30 percent wrong. These were numbers that\neverybody seemed to know, and they had an almost talismanic ability to\nsimplify the past. During conversations, I sometimes nonchalantly mentioned\nthat Mao had been 67 percent correct, just to see what sort of reaction I\nwould get. Invariably the listener corrected me immediately. It made the\nCultural Revolution seem incredibly distant, a question of statistics: the\nlifetime batting average of Mao Zedong.\nIn contrast, nothing was simple about the Opium Wars, which seemed far",
        "heavier in the minds of my students. All year long they had been drilled on\nthe shamefulness of that history, and the return of Hong Kong was portrayed\nas a redemption that would have a real impact on their lives. In contrast, the\nstudent protests of 1989 were the most distant event of all, because as far as\nmy students were concerned the violence had never happened. They had been\nforced to undergo tedious military training as a direct result of the Tiananmen\nSquare crackdown, and yet some of these Sichuanese students were so\npatriotic that the return of Hong Kong would be the happiest day of their\nlives.\nThis was how the changeover looked on campus, but as I spent more time\nin the city I began to realize that everything was different for the average\nChinese worker, the sort of person who was described as laobaixing, “Old\nHundred Names.” Two or three times a week I stopped to chat with Ke\nXianlong, the forty-seven-year-old photographer in South Mountain Gate\nPark, and the more I got to know him the more I was surprised at his political\nviews. He was completely uneducated but he had interesting ideas;\nsometimes he talked about the need for more democracy and other political\nparties, and these were views I never heard on campus. Once I mentioned\nHong Kong, but he simply looked bored—it meant nothing to him.\n“If Hong Kong hadn’t been British for so many years,” he said, “it\nwouldn’t be as rich as it is today. If it had been Chinese, it would have had\nthe Great Leap Forward and the Cultural Revolution and all the other\nproblems, and those would have affected its development. We would have\nruined it like everything else.”\nI had never heard another person in Fuling say anything remotely like\nthat, and I told him that none of my students would agree with him.\n“Of course they have different ideas than me!” he said scornfully. “What\ndo they know? They’re too young! They don’t understand the real world;\nthey have no experience.”\n“But even the older teachers I know don’t have ideas like that.”\n“Of course! They have those political classes every week—they have to\nbelieve whatever the Communist Party says. We Old Hundred Names can\nhave our own ideas. I don’t have to study that stuff they study in the college.”\nI realized that as a thinking person his advantage lay precisely in his lack\nof formal education. Nobody told him what to think, and thus he was free to\nthink clearly.",
        "It wasn’t the sort of revelation that inspires a teacher. The more I thought\nabout this, the more pessimistic I was about the education that my students\nwere receiving, and I began to feel increasingly ambivalent about teaching in\na place like that. In particular it bothered me that very little in my relationship\nwith the third-year students had changed since the fall. They had always been\nobedient and respectful, and they were incredibly enthusiastic about\nliterature. I had a great deal of faith in poetry, but nevertheless this faith had\nits limits; I believed that my job was not only to teach literature but also to\ndevelop a mutual respect and understanding that would allow us to exchange\nideas comfortably. I could see this happening with my Chinese tutors, despite\nthe enormous language and cultural barriers that had made things so difficult\nin the beginning, and this change was impressive because it had required a\ngreat deal of patience and effort from everybody involved. Mostly, it had\nrequired honesty, even if these moments of candor were occasionally\nunpleasant.\nBut my relationship with the students was still miles away from making\nthis transition. I could not mention Chinese xenophobia without their\nbecoming defensive, which told me that they identified more with the random\nChinese harasser on the street than they did with their waiguoren teacher.\nAnd there were still far too many moments when they dropped their heads in\ndiscomfort. This was something I came to loathe—the great head bow.\nWhenever that happened, I realized that I was not teaching forty-five\nindividual students with forty-five individual ideas. I was teaching a group,\nand these were moments when the group thought as one, and a group like that\nwas a mob, even if it was silent and passive. And always I was a waiguoren\nstanding alone at the front of the class.\nOther aspects of local life were starting to disturb me as well.\nIncreasingly I realized that I was being monitored in Fuling, although it was\nhard to tell what the point was. My letters home often showed signs of\ntampering, and occasionally I received something that had been opened. That\nspring my parents mailed me a copy of the New York Times travel section, in\nwhich I had written a story, but somewhere along the way my article had\nbeen carefully cut out. The strangest part was that the story had been about\nthe Mississippi River, and the only reference to China was the brief\nbiographical note at the end of the article, which said I lived in Fuling. Not\nlong after that, I sent my parents a long letter on computer disk, and by the",
        "time they received it one section of the text had been erased and replaced\nwith a string of x’s. It was the only sensitive part of the letter, a description of\nan incident in which I had been harrassed by three drunk college students.\nThe rest of the story was intact, and out of curiosity my father took it to a\ncomputer expert at the University of Missouri, who said that the change could\nonly be the result of deliberate tampering. It was impossible for a disk error\nto produce an alteration like that.\nThese incidents were mildly disturbing, but mostly they were pathetic.\nWhat was the point of censoring an article about the Mississippi River? Who\ntook the time to read letters sent by foreign teachers in places like Fuling?\nCouldn’t this effort be put to some more useful application? I figured that the\npurpose must be intimidation—it was so clumsily done that they obviously\nwanted me to know it was happening. But in fact the tampering was far more\neffective in giving me examples of the kind of pointless paranoia that\ncomposed Communist China.\nCollege life also showed signs of well-organized monitoring. In January,\nanother Peace Corps volunteer near Chengdu had been taken to the local\npolice station after an altercation with a cab driver. The volunteer was clearly\nin the wrong, and eventually he was sent back to America; but during\nquestioning he learned that the police station had a record of everything\ncontroversial that he had ever said in class. All of it was there—his remarks\nabout Capitalism, and Mao Zedong, and everything else that was sensitive in\nany way. He had been particularly disrespectful of the Chinese political\nrestrictions, but I knew that all of us had stumbled across those lines in one\nway or another. And I knew that in the Fuling police station there was\nprobably a file with my remarks about Chinese xenophobia and the Opium\nWars, along with many other things that I had said in class.\nThere were students whose job was to report on the material I covered—\npolitical informers, more or less. Most likely they were the best students;\nprobably they were some of the ones I liked the most. But still they kept track\nof what I said, and it was hard not to think about that when I taught.\nONE OF THE MOST DIFFICULT THINGS to do in class was to have a\ndebate, because usually the students’ opinions were exactly the same. You",
        "had to think of something foreign like Robin Hood, because in those cases\nthey couldn’t turn to what they had been told to think. The point was, more or\nless, to trick them into coming up with their own opinions. In the fall it had\nworked well with Robin Hood, and in the spring it was the same way with\nAdam’s planned-birth-policy debate.\nHe was doing a unit on population problems in his culture class, and we\nthought of the debate topic one night while we were sitting on my balcony\ndrinking local beer. There was no way you could ever debate openly about\nChina’s planned-birth policy—nobody would dare to oppose it—but you\ncould speak freely about America. So that was the topic: Should America\nalso have a law that limits most couples to one child?\nAdam did it with four classes, and it always divided them evenly. There\nwas a pattern to these divisions—the Party Members and the other students in\npositions of authority were always in favor of instituting the policy, while the\nopposing side included more of a fringe element. They wouldn’t have been\nconsidered a fringe element in an American class, of course, but in Fuling\nthey stood out—some of the quieter students, the ones who seemed slightly\nremoved and had nothing to do with the political organization of the class.\nIn every case they ended up debating about China without realizing it,\nwhich of course was exactly what Adam had wanted. During the last debate,\nas the arguments grew heated, a student named Rebecca stood up.\nHe was one of the third-year students who had chosen his English name\npoorly. He had bristly crew-cut hair and tired eyes, and it was clear that he\nwas intelligent, but he was hopelessly lazy and often failed examinations. I\nnever saw him associating with other students. In the debate he was opposed\nto America’s adopting the one-child policy, and he quickly made his point.\n“In America,” he said, speaking clearly, “the people are used to having\nmore freedom than we have in China. They are very concerned with human\nrights. Americans would never support the one-child policy, because they\nwould see this as going against their freedom.”\nHe sat down. An angry murmur ran through the class; for an instant it felt\nlike one of those times when they bowed their heads awkwardly. But then\nsomebody rebutted Rebecca and the moment passed, and the debate\nconcluded without any more comments of the sort.\nThe next day I finished literature class and Rebecca followed me into the\nhall. He asked if he could borrow a magazine, and I told him to come with",
        "me to my office, where we had stacks of old Newsweeks that the Peace Corps\nhad sent us.\nWe were walking up the stairs when Rebecca spoke again. “I think you\nmust notice that in China there is not as much freedom as in America,” he\nsaid. There were students all around us and many of them could speak\nEnglish. Adam had told me about yesterday’s debate, and I knew that must be\nwhat was on the young man’s mind.\n“Let’s go into my office,” I said. “I have lots of magazines there.”\nI left the door partly open. In the hallway it was too loud for people to\nhear us, and I assumed that Rebecca must already have a reputation; a closed\ndoor would only seem suspicious. But he didn’t seem worried about that—he\nsat down and looked me straight in the eye.\n“I often think that our China has many problems,” he said. “There is not\nenough freedom in China. I think in America you have more freedom.”\nIt was the first time I had heard a student speak this way, and I wasn’t\nsure how to respond. “I guess I would agree with you,” I said slowly.\nHis English was not very good and he had to think for the words. After a\npause he said, “I very much admire your American freedom.”\n“But some people think Americans have too much freedom,” I said.\n“That is one of the reasons why there is so much crime in America. People\nhave the freedom to own guns, and they can have any strange ideas they\nwant.”\n“I think that is not so important,” he said. “The life for most people in\nAmerica is very good, and the economy is very good, because there is so\nmuch freedom.”\n“I think that most of your classmates would not agree with you.”\n“No!” he nearly shouted. “They are all different. But they say that I am\nnot the same—sometimes they say that I am a ‘New Man.’ They don’t\nunderstand why I think this way.”\n“Well,” I said. “I guess I agree with your ideas. But I think you probably\nshould be careful.”\n“Sometimes I have fear,” he said. “Often I am afraid I can’t say what I\nthink.” The crowds in the hall were diminishing, and it was growing quieter,\nand I was thinking: Why are you still talking so loudly? But it was clear that\nhe had steeled himself for a long time to have this conversation, and he\nignored everything else as he stared at me and spoke evenly.",
        "“I don’t like this college,” he said. “I don’t like the rules, and I don’t\nagree with the ideas of the other students. And I don’t like the rules in\nChina.”\n“Probably things will be different in the future,” I said. “And already I\nthink they are a little different in places like Beijing and Shanghai.”\n“Everything changes too slowly in China,” he said. “I wish I could live in\na place like America where you have freedom.”\nI knew that this was unlikely but I didn’t say it. “Many people think\nChina is changing quickly,” I said. “You might find that it’s very different in\na few years. I read something about it a week ago.” I picked out a magazine\nthat had an article suggesting the government might reevaluate the\nTiananmen protests in the near future. It wasn’t much, but I had nothing else\nto offer Rebecca.\n“You might think this is interesting,” I said, handing him the magazine.\nHe took it and thanked me, and then he stared me in the eye again.\n“Do you like living in China?” he asked.\n“Yes,” I said. “But probably I don’t have the same problems that you\nhave. Sometimes I don’t like the political system, but it doesn’t affect me\nvery much. There are many other things I like.”\n“If I were you,” he said, “I would not like it here at all. I would stay in\nAmerica.”\nThat was all he had to say. He stood up, nodded goodbye, and left. On the\nway out he closed the door to my office.\nI sat there alone for a while, thinking about what he had said. He was the\nonly student who was anything like a dissident, and I remembered how I had\nimagined those figures before coming to Fuling. I had always assumed that\nthey were noble characters—charismatic, intelligent, farsighted, brave.\nPerhaps that was the way it had been in 1989, and perhaps it was still like that\nin the bigger cities; but here in Fuling things were very different. My best\nstudents—Soddy, Linda, Armstrong, Aumur; the ones who were charismatic,\nintelligent, farsighted, and brave—those were the ones who had been\nrecruited long ago as Party Members. If you had any talent you played by the\nrules; being a Party Member was good for your career, and in any case all of\nthe students seemed to think that it was good to be patriotic in the narrow\nway that they were told to be. The image I had once had of the Chinese\ndissident had no reality in Fuling.",
        "All I had was Rebecca—he was the only one, and he was a loser. He was\na bad student, and he was socially awkward. He had no friends. He had a\ngirl’s name. Some of these characteristics had conspired to set him apart, and\nin his bitterness his ideas had undoubtedly swung even further from the Party\nline. If there were big changes in China’s future, it was hard to imagine them\ncoming from people like Rebecca, or, for that matter, from any of my other\nstudents. I realized again that any major developments would happen first in\nBeijing or Shanghai, and then at some point they would reverberate down to\nplaces like Fuling, just as they always had.\nNever again did Rebecca speak openly about the subject, but a couple of\ntimes I gave him magazines and he always thanked me. On the final exam I\ngraded him higher than I should have. Partly I admired his bravery, but\nmostly I just felt sorry for him.\nIN THE MIDDLE OF JUNE, the sinus infection moved into my right ear\nand broke the eardrum. It happened quickly—one afternoon I began to feel\npressure building in my ear, and by dinner it was painful and soon it was\nunbearable. The entire right side of my head throbbed with the pain, but there\nwas nothing to do except wait for the pressure to break the eardrum.\nIt was impossible to sleep, and the pain was too distracting for reading.\nPainkillers did nothing; finally all I could do was sit on my couch and watch\ntelevision. There was a music program with elaborate floor shows and I\nwatched that for a while, and then there was a show where small children\nwearing lots of makeup danced and did tumbling routines. There were always\nprograms like that on television—the Chinese love children intensely, and at\nalmost any hour of the day you could find a channel where a pack of them\nwere grinning and bouncing across a stage.\nWhen it got late there was only one station left, and in preparation for the\nreturn of Hong Kong they showed a movie about the Opium Wars. The pain\nin my ear was growing even more intense, and in my bitterness I consciously\nmade things worse by watching the movie closely and scribbling quotes onto\na pad of paper. The movie had English subtitles, which made it easier to take\nnotes from the dialogue: “These foreigners are really avaricious” “These\ntreaties are not only humiliating but unequal” “But the foreigners have evil",
        "designs” “Foreigners invade us only for gains” “Foreigners have insatiable\nlusts” “Frankly, we can bluff to foreigners” “Why? Why are they so\narrogant?”\nThe foreigners were British and at the end of the film they looted the\nSummer Palace. There was an auction and an ugly red-bearded Brit held up a\nscroll and said, “This is the oldest Chinese painting.” He asked for one\npound, but nobody responded. After the auction they burned down the palace.\nThe movie finished just after one o’clock in the morning and there was\nnothing else on television. I went outside and walked around campus for a\nwhile. The walking was a better distraction than watching a movie about the\nOpium Wars. The temperature was perfect, and everything was quiet, and\nstars flickered above the dark profile of White Flat Mountain. I knew that this\nwas not a high point of my experience in China, but it was a pleasant evening\nand that was worth something.\nFinally after another hour I was able to fall asleep. In the morning I\nawoke with my eardrum broken and my pillow covered with blood. But my\nhead didn’t hurt anymore, and I was able to take the long trip back to the\nPeace Corps headquarters in Chengdu—three hours by fast boat, four hours\nby bus. I visited the staff medical officer, who cleaned out my ear, and then I\nrested for five days, sitting in the teahouse at Chengdu’s People’s Park. When\nmy health improved, I went back to Fuling for the end of the term. The main\nconsequence was that for a month I couldn’t hear anything out of my right\near, except for a constant ringing sound. For a while the ringing was\nannoying, but soon I realized that it was better than listening to all the\nhonking. If you have to be half-deaf somewhere, you might as well be half-\ndeaf in Fuling.\nON JUNE 30, all classes were canceled for Hong Kong’s return. The\ncountdown sign was moved to a prominent spot along the college road, and\nred banners were hung from the dormitories. Colored lights and lanterns\ndecorated the hallways of the teaching building.\nMy classes were finished. Adam had left early; I would go in two days,\nafter grading my final exams.\nAt four o’clock, the students filed into their classrooms to watch",
        "television. There were special programs until two o’clock the next morning,\nand the students were scheduled to watch ten consecutive hours of television.\nThey were excited and the teaching building was full of laughter.\nAt nine o’clock, fireworks exploded above the city and the students ran\nshouting onto the breezeway to watch. The Wu River pulsed with streaks of\nred and yellow, the sound booming across the valley. Everything in Fuling\nwas illuminated—the shops, the apartment windows, the long riverside road\n—and it seemed that the city was burning on the hills beside the rivers.\nThere were groups of children wandering around campus, the way they\nalways did on holidays, and some boys came up to see me in my office. I was\ngrading papers and they were led by Wang Xuesong, the eight-year-old who\nlived in the apartment across from mine. One of my more memorable\nconversations in Fuling was on another occasion when I asked Wang\nXuesong who China’s enemies were.\n“England,” he responded quickly.\n“Why?”\n“Because of the Opium Wars. They stole Hong Kong from our China.”\nI asked him if there were any enemies besides England, and again he\nanswered immediately.\n“Japan. Because of the Nanjing Massacre.”\n“Are there any others?”\n“Portugal.”\nI asked him why, and this time he had to think for a moment.\n“Because they took Guangzhou.”\nI let the mistake slide, assuming that he meant Macau. I asked him one\nmore question.\n“Who are China’s friends?”\nHe furrowed his brow and cocked his head to one side. “I don’t know,”\nhe said at last, shrugging.\nOn the night of Hong Kong’s return, Wang Xuesong and the other boys\nbounced on the furniture in my office, chattering excitedly. I gave them some\nforeign stamps I had lying around, and we talked about Hong Kong. I told\nthem I had lived in England for two years, which seemed to impress them—\nsomehow I had survived.\nAt half past eleven, a few of my first-year students stopped by my office\nto chat. They had become my favorites—at the beginning of the year they",
        "were painfully shy, but they were enthusiastic and the classes were always\nenjoyable. I didn’t feel quite as much distance as I did with the third-year\nstudents, probably because the first-years were at a much lower level and my\nexpectations weren’t so high. When students studied Shakespeare, and\nstudied it well, it was difficult to understand why they couldn’t seem to\novercome the simple fact that their teacher was a foreigner.\nI had named the first-year students, which made them especially\nappealing. Some of them had been named after friends and family; often I put\nrelatives together when I assigned group work, so that my sister Angela could\nwork with my grandmother Doria, while my other sister Amy could be with\nConnor and Heidi, who were her children. The rest had names I simply liked:\nPuck, Anfernee, Miranda, Latoya, Ariel, Mike D, Ophelia, MCA. In that\nsense they were a very diverse group—much different from your standard\nclass in Fuling, in which so many of them had similar backgrounds and\nsimilar ideas. It seemed inevitable that students named Latoya and Ophelia\nwould have vastly different opinions about virtually everything; or at least\nthat was my fantasy, because diversity was something about America that I\nmissed. In particular, it was strange to live in a place where everybody was\nthe same race. For a year I hadn’t seen a black person. But in my first-year\nclass I had Latoya and Anfernee, who were better than nothing. And mostly I\nliked calling role at the start of class, saying names that were both exotic and\nfamiliar.\nTonight they were exhausted—they were like children who had been\ngiven permission to stay up all night, and in their excitement they had worn\nthemselves out by dinnertime. Ariel’s eyes were heavy with fatigue, and she\ntold me that she had tried to go back to the dormitory but the doors were\nlocked. Nobody was allowed to go to sleep until Hong Kong returned.\nTen minutes before midnight, I stepped into one of the TV rooms. All of\nthe lights were off and almost one hundred students were watching the tiny\nscreen. I looked for Rebecca and saw him sitting alone in a corner. The light\nof the television flickered blue off his glasses.\nFor days there had been torrential rains in Hong Kong. The ceremony\ncontinued, as steady as the clock that counted down in the corner of our\ntelevision screen, and the students cheered when President Jiang Zemin\nappeared. They applauded when they first caught sight of the Chinese flag.\nThey laughed at Prince Charles, and at the kilted Scottish flag-bearers who",
        "marched across the podium. At the stroke of midnight the students screamed\nwhen the red flag rose and the Chinese national anthem began to play, and\nthe teaching building rang with the roar of the celebration.\nAfter midnight there were speeches, with Jiang Zemin promising that\nthere would be no changes in the economy and the human rights of the\nSpecial Autonomous Region. In Hong Kong it was still raining hard. I\nlistened for a few minutes and then left. On the way back to my apartment, I\ncut through the croquet court, where a few student couples were celebrating\nin their own way. They were making out in the shadows, taking advantage of\nthe night.",
        "CHAPTER SEVEN",
        "Summer\nYAN’AN LOOKED AS IF A HARD RAIN would wash it away. A fine\nyellow dust covered the small city, and the crumbling hills above town were\npockmarked by the oval mouths of caves. People still lived in caves in the\nsuburbs of Yan’an, and many of the troglodytes were making a good show of\nit. There were caves with televisions, refrigerators, karaoke machines. North\nof Yan’an were villages whose school buildings and government offices had\nbeen carved into the dry loess hillsides. It was, in a land of blazing summers\nand cold winters, a sensible way to live.\nThe countryside in this part of northern China was forbidding and\ndesolate, but it was also eerily beautiful. And it was exactly what I needed\nafter a year in Sichuan; nothing could be more different from Fuling’s green\nrice terraces and misty rivers. The air in Yan’an was dry and there was a hard\nblue sky above the dusty hills.\nI was free that summer. The Peace Corps was going to fund my Chinese\nstudy for a month in Xi’an, but that wouldn’t start for two weeks and now I\nwas wandering into northern Shaanxi province. In some ways this region was\nthe heart of modern China, at least politically, because the Long March had\nended here in 1935. Ever since my arrival in Fuling, I had heard about the\nLong March and the Yan’an years, and I knew that northern Shaanxi\nprovince had been crucial to the Communist resistance against both the\nJapanese and the Kuomintang. And from history I also knew that the fragility\nof the landscape was an illusion; these hills had seen far worse than hard\nrains, but they were still here.\nA sign near the entrance to the Yan’an Revolution Museum said:\n“Celebrate Hong Kong’s Return, Wish Prosperity to the Motherland.” I paid\nten yuan and saw the museum’s exhibits. Mao Zedong’s horse was stuffed\nand on display, along with Mao’s machete and saddle. There was a war poem\nwritten in Mao’s distinctive flowing calligraphy. There were maps of major",
        "battles, and photographs of the revolutionaries who had lived in Yan’an.\nThere weren’t many tourists. The glass-eyed horse’s name was Xiao Qing\nand it stood slightly off-kilter.\nLooking at the horse’s name I thought about Jiang Qing, the woman who\nmarried Mao in Yan’an, and I realized that I hadn’t seen any photographs of\nher. I walked back to the entrance, where the ticket-taker was knitting a\nsweater.\n“Didn’t Chairman Mao meet Jiang Qing here?” I asked.\n“Yes,” the worker said.\n“Do you have any pictures of her?”\n“No photos of the Gang of Four,” she said curtly, and then she went back\nto her knitting.\nIt was the same at Zaoyuan Park, where they had the cave homes of Mao\nand the other Red Army leaders. Liu Shaoqi’s cave had photos of him and his\nwife, Wang Guangmei; and Zhu De was pictured with his wife; but in Mao’s\ncave all traces of Jiang Qing were gone. She was a complication of history,\nand so her memory had been removed, leaving the cave with only its simple\nfurnishings: a bed, a bathtub, a bookshelf, a stone floor. Out in front, tourists\ncould dress up in the gray uniforms of the wartime Communists and have\ntheir photos taken. Teenage girls giggled as they mounted horses and\nbrandished pistols.\nI met a Xi’an railway mechanic in his forties, who said that he had come\nto teach his daughter about the Revolution. She was eight years old, with\npigtails and plastic Hong Kong Returns slippers. “The younger people in\nChina don’t know about the Revolution,” her father said. “Our generation\ndoes, so I’ve taken her here to study our Chinese history.”\nHe asked me what Americans thought about the Revolution, and I said\nthat most people didn’t understand it, which was the safest response. It\nalways made the Chinese happy when waiguoren said they didn’t understand\nChina. The mechanic and I talked for a while and then, as a polite way to\nshow that the conversation was ending, he said solemnly, “Our two countries\nhave taken different roads. But now we are friends.”\n“Yes,” I said. “We can forget about the problems of the past.” Many of\nmy random discussions in small places like Fuling and Yan’an ended like\nthat; the people seemed to feel a need to summarize the relations between\nChina and America, as if this had great bearing on the conversation at hand.",
        "Often it was the first time they had spoken with an American, which made\nour interaction seem like a momentous occasion. I liked that aspect of\nspending time in remote parts of China—every casual conversation was a\nmajor diplomatic event.\nI was in the mood to talk, and so I sat on a bench near the park entrance.\nWithin minutes an old man caught sight of me and hurried over. He told me\nthat he was a veteran of Yan’an’s Red Army, and he smiled when I said I was\nAmerican.\n“Thank you for helping us in the War of Resistance Against the\nJapanese,” he said. It wasn’t the first time I had been thanked for my\ncountry’s role in World War II. Chongqing cab drivers were particularly fond\nof expressing their gratitude, and I gave the old man the same response I\nalways gave the cabbies.\n“Mei guanxi,” I said. “No problem.”\nBy now a small crowd had gathered, curious to see the waiguoren. I\nbegan to talk with a student from Xi’an’s Communications University, who\nexplained that she had come because she was interested in the early years of\nChinese Communism. I asked her what would have happened if the\nrevolutionaries had failed.\n“Today there would be no Communist Party,” she said.\n“What if there were no Communist Party?”\n“China would be different?”\n“How?”\n“It would be like Taiwan,” she said. “Like America.”\n“What are those places like?”\n“The economy is developed, but—” and now she shifted from Chinese\ninto faltering English, because it was a phrase she remembered from her\nstudies—“but the rich get richer and the poor get poorer.”\n“What about the new economic policies—do you agree with Reform and\nOpening?”\n“Of course. All of us agree with that.”\n“But what about the gap between the rich and the poor? Doesn’t it get\nbigger?”\n“Some people will get rich,” she said, “like scientists and businessmen.\nBut this is necessary to develop the economy, and although others will\nimprove more slowly, they will improve.”",
        "We talked for a few minutes longer. She asked if it was true that most\nAmericans didn’t understand China, and I agreed. I said nothing about the\nchallenge of understanding a country in which one heard theories of trickle-\ndown Capitalist economics in front of the enshrined cave homes of Marxist\nrevolutionaries. On my way out of the museum, I passed rows of souvenir\nstands, where they sold Mao pendants, Communist Party history books, fake\njade, cloth hangings, necklaces, statues, bracelets, stamps, cymbals, drums,\ngourmet rice. A commemorative Hong Kong Returns coin set was 320 yuan.\nThe hawkers shouted out to me as I left.\nTHAT EVENING policemen burst into my hotel room after midnight. It\nwas a cheap hotel near the train station, and I was fast asleep when the cops\ncame in.\nThere was no warning. I had locked the door but the policemen got a key\nfrom one of the workers, and they entered and turned on the light. By the\ntime I sat up, five officers were crowding around my bed, and I was terrified.\n“What’s the problem? What’s the problem?” I asked the question again\nand again, but they simply stared at me. “What’s the problem? What’s the\nproblem?” They listened and stared, and finally one of them spoke.\n“We want to see your passport,” he said.\nTrembling, I took out my money belt and gave him the passport. He\nopened it and looked at the photograph on the first page. Then slowly he\ngazed at the second page. There was nothing on that page except the colorful\ndesigns of the passport paper, and the other policemen crowded around to\nlook. The cop turned to the third page, also emptily full of color, and they\nstared at that as well.\nMy head was starting to clear and now I saw how young-looking they\nwere—little more than scrawny boys in baggy uniforms. They gazed at me\nshyly. I showed them the passport page with the Chinese visa and they liked\nthat, because they could read it. They flipped through the rest of the pages\nand then handed it back, smiling.\n“Is everything okay?” I asked.\n“Yes,” said one of them. But still they stood there staring at me in bed.\nThere was a long silence.",
        "“Well,” I said, “I’m tired. I think I will go to sleep now. Thank you very\nmuch.”\n“Thank you,” all of them said at once. They took a long last look at me\nbefore they walked out. I locked the door behind them and went back to\nsleep.\nTHERE WAS NO GOOD REASON TO GO to Yulin and it took ten hours\nto get there. None of the guidebooks said much about it, except that\nwaiguoren were restricted to staying in two expensive hotels. Yulin was a\nsmall town at the very northern tip of Shaanxi province, right near the border\nof Inner Mongolia, which was why I decided to go.\nNorth of Yan’an the countryside grew even more desolate, rising through\nnarrow canyons filled with cave dwellings. The river alongside the road died\nto a trickle, and in the burning heat all life was centered around that frail\nstream of water: peasants toting buckets, women washing clothes, boys\nswimming naked in shallow green pools. There were crop terraces high\nabove the river, decorated with dusty signs: Control the Population, Improve\nthe Population Quality. Having people here at all said a great deal about\nChina, and it said far more that even in this godforsaken place their\npopulation was controlled.\nAfter five hours I had seen enough. It was a brutally hot, dusty day, and\nthe road was under construction, and the broken-down bus was crowded. But\nthere was nothing to do except stick it out. Virtually every bus trip I took in\nChina seemed to reach that point—all of them were exactly twice as long as I\nwas willing to bear. And I knew that I would have to come back the same\nway, and that in Yulin I would undoubtedly pay a ridiculous price to stay in a\nthree-star waiguoren hotel, and I wished I hadn’t come.\nI arrived just after sunset and saw a cheap hotel next to the bus station.\nMy guidebook said that it was restricted to Chinese, but I figured there was\nnothing to lose by trying. The worker stared at me in surprise when I walked\nin. Frantically she waved and gestured me back toward the door, her eyes\nwide and silent as if she had been struck dumb.\n“I can speak Chinese,” I said, and the shock of hearing this made her eyes\nwiden even further. Finally she recovered enough to ask what I wanted.",
        "“I want to stay at this hotel.”\n“Waiguoren can’t stay here,” she said. “You have to go to a different\nhotel.” But she was still too shocked to be rude, the way most workers were\nwhen they were set against giving you something. This gave me an idea.\n“They’ve changed that rule,” I said. “Waiguoren can stay in the same\nplaces as Chinese now.”\nHer eyes narrowed but she was still listening. I took some of my Chinese\ntextbook’s vocabulary and ran with it. “The National People’s Congress\nchanged the law,” I said. “In Beijing they just changed it. Haven’t you heard?\nAt least it’s changed if you’re a teacher. Foreign teachers can stay in Chinese\nhotels, because we live in China and our salaries are the same as Chinese. See\n—here’s my danwei card.”\nI gave her my red work unit card, my light green foreign resident card,\nmy dark green foreign expert card, and my blue passport. The cards made a\ncolorful pile and the worker leafed through them slowly, awed and\noverwhelmed. The Chinese have a weakness for official documents, and they\noften liked staring at the black-and-white foreign devil pictures on my\nidentification cards. She gazed at them carefully, one by one, and then she\ngave me a registration slip for a two-dollar room. For the rest of the summer,\nI always referred to the National People’s Congress when all else failed, and\nthis turned out to be a remarkably effective tactic. Finally I saw the point of\nall the political jargon that I had memorized in class.\nThe next morning I caught a taxi north of Yulin, where the Great Wall\nran through the desert. Tourists rarely came to see the wall here, because it\nwas unrestored and the northern Shaanxi roads were so bad. There was no\nmention of the wall in my guidebook, but I had a Chinese map of the\nprovince which marked the ruins clearly.\nThe cabbie took me to a big Ming Dynasty fort that stood five miles\noutside of town, where Yulin’s irrigated fields ended and the desert began.\nFrom the fort’s highest tower the view stretched northward for miles.\nOccasionally the barrenness was punctuated by a slice of green where water\nhad found its way—a stand of trees, a lonely field—but mostly it was just\nsand and low brown hills and a vast thoughtless sky. At nine in the morning\nthe sun was already hot. I looked out at the empty landscape, at the hard low\nline of the horizon, and I realized why they had built the wall here. Even if\nthere had been no Mongol threat, the terror of the land’s monotony would be",
        "enough to make you build something.\nThe wall ran east and west from the fort. Westward it continued to its\nfinal stopping point at Jiayu Pass, in the mountains of northern Gansu\nprovince. Eastward the ruins ran to Zhonghai Pass, at the shore of the Yellow\nSea. All told the distance between these two endpoints was probably more\nthan fifteen hundred miles, and Yulin was somewhere roughly in the middle;\nbut the wall had never been fully surveyed and nobody knew the exact\nlength. I stood there at the desert fort, looking out at the heat waves\nshimmering above the sandy hills, and I decided to go toward the ocean. I\ntightened my boots and walked east along the ruins.\nMost of the wall was just a three-foot-high ridge of packed earth that had\nbeen worn down by the wind and sand. Every two hundred yards or so I\npassed the ruins of a signal tower—a crumbling twenty-foot-high pile of dirt\nstanding uselessly under the burning sun. I followed the wall through a brick\nfactory, and then it swung across an irrigation canal and through a cornfield.\nA mound of sand swallowed the ridge, and I skirted the dune until I saw the\nnext tower rising in the distance. A field of poplars had been planted nearby,\nthe trees thin and brittle-looking under the Shaanxi sun. The Great Wall sank\nto a foot-high mound, and beyond that the lone and level sands stretched far\naway.\nIt was a ragged, patchwork landscape, and the green swaths of corn and\nclusters of poplars spoke of hard work that, in the face of the dunes and the\ndead brown horizon, appeared likely to be wasted. Likewise the ruined wall\nwas a testimony to another sort of wastefulness, because the Ming rulers had\nbuilt the fortification against outsiders who would have been better handled\nthrough diplomacy. And the size of the thing—both its pathetic smallness and\nits amazing bigness; the fact that I could step across it easily and the fact that\nit stretched for fifteen hundred miles—all of that showed how far the Chinese\ncould go with a bad idea.\nBut it also seemed very Chinese that despite its original failure the wall\nnow had great value. It had become perhaps the most powerful symbol of\nnational pride, and nobody connected it with negative qualities like\nisolationism and stubbornness. Television stations often showed a music\nvideo that had been filmed on the Great Wall; the song was called “Love My\nChina,” and it celebrated the nation’s fifty-five minorities and the happiness\nthey enjoyed in the People’s Republic. “Love My China” was a miserable,",
        "cloying song, but like so many of the bad music programs on television it had\na sort of fatal attraction—I always watched it to the bitter end. The song’s\nconclusion featured representative minorities dancing on the Great Wall,\ndressed in traditional costumes as they sang about how much they loved their\nChina. Every time I watched it, I thought: Your China built that wall to keep\nyou people out.\nIt seemed there was always something of this sort on television—at\nvirtually any hour of the day you could find a channel that was focusing on\nsome happy minority, usually the Tibetans. This kind of entertainment struck\nme as uniquely hypocritical, at least until the next year when I returned home\nfrom China and tutored at a public elementary school in Missouri, where the\nchildren celebrated Thanksgiving with traditional stories about the wonderful\nfriendship between the Pilgrims and the Indians. I realized that these myths\nwere a sort of link between America and China—both countries were\narrogant enough to twist some of their greatest failures into sources of pride.\nAnd now that I thought about it, I remembered seeing Indians dance more\nthan a few times on American television.\nBut just like Thanksgiving, the Great Wall had outgrown its original\nsignificance and now it simply meant greatness. Much of what was\ncommonly written about it was false—that it was two thousand years old, that\nit could be seen from space—but the facts didn’t matter. Even as a metaphor\nfor Chinese isolationism it had lost its force, because every foreign dignitary\nwas taken to view the Great Wall near Beijing, and every waiguoren tourist\nvisited it. It was a major attraction of the new open China, a bridge rather\nthan a wall, and it allowed the Chinese to introduce outsiders to the glories of\ntheir country in a single awe-inspiring vista. Rather than keeping the\nbarbarians out, it ensured that after arrival they viewed China with a certain\nrespect, and thus its construction hadn’t really been a waste. It had taken an\nextra five hundred years, but finally the Chinese had made something useful\nout of the Great Wall. And in the same way I knew that the hard-fought\npatches of corn among these sand dunes weren’t wasted; somehow they\nwould survive.\nI followed the wall east for nearly an hour. Sometimes I walked on top\nand the dirt crumbled beneath my feet. I passed another group of poplars,\nstartling a pheasant that crashed away through the underbrush. Lizards\nskittered across the sand. I ran out of water and then I walked back to the fort.",
        "IT WAS IN YULIN that I first realized my Chinese life had turned a corner.\nIt had never been easy to live as a waiguoren in a place like Fuling, where the\npressures could be exhausting—the stifling attention, the constant mocking\nshouts, the ongoing struggle of establishing what a foreigner could and\ncouldn’t do. But there was also another side to these hassles, because the\nChinese were fascinated by waiguoren and once a conversation started they\ntended to treat me much better than the average person. It was very different\nfrom America, where you wouldn’t shout at somebody just because he\nlooked strange, but at the same time you probably wouldn’t go out of your\nway to talk with him or show him kindness.\nIn the spring I had sensed that the benefits were starting to outweigh the\ndifficulties, and mostly it was a matter of developing patience and trust. I had\nto allow things to happen—if somebody approached me, I talked with him,\nand I accepted virtually any invitation. I couldn’t expect to control every\nsituation, and I couldn’t be constantly suspicious of people’s intentions,\nwhich were almost invariably good. To live as a waiguoren required a certain\npassivity, but I had never been a passive person, and it took most of the\nspring to become comfortable with this role. In Yulin, it finally felt right—at\nlast I accepted that things happened best when I simply let them happen.\nOne of the keys was time, which was something I always had in China.\nEven during busy teaching periods in Fuling, I always had plenty of spare\ntime, because so much of what usually occupied me in America had been\nstripped away: family, friends, familiar routines. I had no access to the\nInternet and I couldn’t afford to call people. I could write letters, but the post\nwas so slow that communication was barely possible. When my older sister\ngave birth to a daughter in the fall of my first year, I didn’t find out for three\nweeks.\nIt could be overwhelming to have so much free time, but it was also\nenormously liberating, and there were countless afternoons when I did\nnothing but sit in a teahouse with a newspaper, talking with whoever showed\nup. This became my traveling routine as well; in a new city I’d find a park or\nsomeplace where I could sit and read until a local stopped to chat.\nAfter walking along the wall, I sat in the shade of the Ming fort, writing",
        "in my journal. A few minutes later, three young women paused to ask where I\nwas from, and we talked for a while. They were former middle school\nclassmates who were back in town for a reunion. Another old classmate and\nher husband had opened a restaurant just down the road, and they invited me\nto join them for lunch. The local specialty was something that involved pig\nstomach, so we ate that and drank Yulin beer.\nNone of them could understand why a waiguoren would travel all the\nway to Yulin, until I told them that I had been living in Sichuan. In their eyes\nthis explained a great deal.\n“The people in Sichuan are very jiaohua—sneaky. And their women have\na bad reputation.”\n“They don’t have culture in Sichuan like we do in Shaanxi. Did you\nknow that this is the cradle of Chinese culture?”\n“Have you been to Xi’an? That’s the capital of our Shaanxi and the\nancient capital of China. And that’s why it’s easier to understand us than the\nSichuanese, because our dialect used to be the country’s standard speech. The\nMandarin in Beijing is similar to the way we speak here. In Sichuan the way\nthey talk sounds terrible.”\nThey were right about the dialect—traveling in Shaanxi was like having\nan enormous linguistic weight lifted off my chest. I took the rest of their\nopinions with a grain of salt, because I knew that the Chinese always had\nstrong prejudices about people from other parts of the country. Before I had\nleft Fuling, Teacher Liao had given me a careful introduction to Shaanxi\nprovince.\n“I wish I could visit Xi’an,” she sighed. “You’ll be able to see the terra-\ncotta warriors, the tomb of Emperor Qin Shihuang, and the Forest of Steles.\nYou are very fortunate. But the people from the north are different from us\nhere in the south. They’re bigger, you know, because they eat wheat instead\nof rice, and the women aren’t as pretty as the women here in Sichuan. That’s\nbecause the sun’s so terrible, and there’s too much wind and sand. All of the\nwomen in the north have bad skin.”\nListening to the Shaanxi women criticize Sichuan made me remember\nwhat Teacher Liao had said, and I figured that as a faithful student it was only\nright that I bring up the drawbacks of the north.\n“In Sichuan,” I told the women, “some of my friends say the south is\nbetter than the north, because of the climate. They say many people in the",
        "north have bad skin because of the sun. I don’t know if this is true, but that’s\nwhat they told me.”\nThis took nobody by surprise; obviously they had heard these theories\nbefore and there was a ready defense. “That’s true in most parts of the north,”\nagreed Wang Yumei, who was the most talkative of the women. “But Yulin\nis different, because of our water. Our water here is very, very good! It comes\nfrom very deep in the ground, and people say that because of our water the\nwomen here are beautiful. So even though the sun is terrible our skin is still\ngood. Look—my skin isn’t black.”\nI had to admit it was true—there was nothing wrong with Wang Yumei’s\nskin. And I thought that if you could somehow pipe Yulin’s water down to\nFuling you would without a doubt have the most beautiful women in China,\nand perhaps in the entire world, because of the mountains and the rivers and\nthe deep well water of the desert town.\nAfter lunch we went across the street to a Buddhist temple so that Guo\nXiaoqin, who was the only unmarried woman in the group, could have her\nfortune told. As we entered, the priest and a young man were screaming at\neach other. The priest had given the young man a bad fortune, after which he\nhad refused to make a donation, and in the resulting argument the young man\nhad knocked over some things in the temple and the priest had hit him. The\npriest, who was in his sixties, stood in the center of the courtyard, shaking his\nfist. The young man was with a friend who held him back while he screamed\nobscenities. It was very hot now, and the women and I sat in the shade of a\nside temple, waiting for the argument to end.\nAs far as public disputes went, it was average, consisting of two acts. The\nyoung man was dragged out of the courtyard by his friend, but then he fought\nhis way free and stormed back into the temple, where he and the priest\nscreamed at each other for another five minutes. It was clear that the young\nman had no interest in hurting the priest, and certainly it was too late to\nchange his fortune; he was simply saving face, and his friend laughed as he\npushed him back toward the exit. After they were gone, we waited until his\nshouts trailed off into the distance and it was clear that there would not be a\nthird act. Some of the public disputes I had seen in Fuling had so many acts\nthat even the stick-stick soldiers got bored and wandered off.\nThe argument wasn’t a particularly auspicious omen for fortunetelling in\nthis temple, but Guo Xiaoqin, who was twenty-six years old and clearly felt",
        "that time was an issue, decided to continue. The priest collected himself,\nprayed, and told the woman to kowtow three times before the altar. He struck\na gong as she bowed, and then he gave her a tube filled with wooden sticks.\nShe shook the tube until one of the sticks rattled free, and the priest looked at\nthe number and interpreted the fortune. He said that she would be married\nsoon, perhaps within the year, and everybody sighed with relief. Wang\nYumei gave the priest ten yuan. He smiled as we left.\nWe walked down the road to the Red Cliff Gorge, where Daoist and\nBuddhist temples, some of them more than thirteen centuries old, had been\ncarved into the sandstone cliffs. In the center of the gorge a river flowed clear\nbetween sandy banks. We took off our shoes and waded through the\nshallows, and then we sat in the shade. Across the river a group of six young\npeasants had come to have a picnic. They were men and women in their early\ntwenties, and after lunch they splashed in the river, the women screaming as\nthe men chased them up and down the sandy gorge.\n“Do you have places like this in your country?” Wang Yumei asked. I\ntried to imagine having a reunion with my friends in America and picking up\na random foreigner and spending the day with him, simply out of curiosity\nand kindness.\n“No,” I said. “It’s not quite the same as this in my country.”\nI DIDN’T WANT TO LEAVE YULIN. The hotel was fine and, despite the\nheat of the days, the nights were desert-cool and there was never any problem\nsleeping. The mornings were pleasant, and every day I woke up early and\nwatched the traffic on the main street. Old men swept their shopfronts, and\nwomen dragged milk carts along the main street, and the night soil collectors\nheaded past on their way out to the countryside. Junkmen pulled wagons,\nthumping little hand drums to attract sales. Horse-drawn carts delivered coal\nto the small restaurants, and the sun rose bright above the tiled roofs of the\nbuildings, and slowly the dusty city grew hot.\nThe main street passed beneath three Ming Dynasty towers, and nearly all\nof the other buildings on the street dated to at least the Qing Dynasty. Yulin’s\nancient city wall was still intact, rising twenty feet above the buildings. I had\nnever seen such a well-preserved old town in China, and yet there weren’t",
        "any other foreign tourists in the city.\nEvery day I watched the morning street until it started to become hot, and\nthen I’d buy some yogurt and find a shaded restaurant where I could eat\nsteamed rolls and try to read a newspaper. One morning I bought my yogurt\nfrom an old man who became very excited, gesturing for me to wait while he\nran back home. He returned with an old Chinese book, which he handed to\nme without a word.\nI opened it and tried to read the first page. Some of it was unclear but I\ncould get the general idea—something about the start, earth and water, light\nand dark. The man waited patiently while I read. I made my way through the\nrest of the page, and then I realized what I was reading. I looked up at the old\nman.\n“Are you Christian?” I asked.\n“Yes!” He beamed and shook my hand.\n“Where is this Bible from?”\n“Our friends from Sweden gave it to us,” he said, and I figured they must\nhave been Lutheran missionaries. I told him that I had lived in Sweden as a\nchild, which pleased him. He asked if I was also Christian.\n“I’m Catholic.”\n“Chabuduo, “he said. “That’s almost the same as our Christianity. Most\nof it is the same but you believe more in Mali.”\nHe was right about Mary being a sticking point, but nevertheless he\nseemed happy to meet me. His name was Luo and he invited me to come\nback later, so I could meet his son and grandchildren.\nThe Luos lived on the main street, in a traditional siheyuanr, an old brick\ncomplex organized around a central courtyard. Now there were seven\nbranches of the family living there, all of them named Luo, and the buildings\nhad not changed much in centuries. In the old man’s home they still slept on\na traditional kang, an old-fashioned brick bed that was heated by coal in the\nwinter.\nHe told me that his ancestors had been Qing Dynasty soldiers sent north\nfrom Xi’an in the 1700s to fight the Mongols beyond the wall. They were\nposted here to keep the foreigners at bay, but their descendants came under\nforeign influence anyway—missionaries had converted the old man’s parents\nbefore Liberation. A simple cross hung above his old kang, a curious\nconjunction of relics.",
        "The old man’s son was named Luo Xiaolei; he was in his mid-forties and\nhe edited a local literary magazine. His daughter had just graduated from the\nChinese department of Yulin Teachers College. They were friendly, well-\neducated people, and during the week I spent in Yulin I went to their home\nevery day. Often they served me a late breakfast, and after eating we would\nsit with tea and watermelon in the shade of their living room.\nLuo Xiaolei had spent five years in prison during the Cultural Revolution,\nbecause he was an intellectual and a Christian, and his father had been exiled\nto ten years of labor in a remote part of the desert. The old man didn’t say\nmuch about that experience, except that the work was difficult and served no\npurpose. That was often the way people described their exiles—the wasted\ntime was the worst part.\nI found it easy to speak openly with the Luos, because their experiences\nhad made them skeptical, and because soon I would leave this place. That\nwas the best part of traveling—I wasn’t really accountable for things I did\nand said; I could wander off with anybody and talk about anything I wanted.\nIt wasn’t like living in Fuling, where people kept track of me and there was\nalways the knowledge that I still had another year left in the river town. There\nwere many good things about having a home in China, but that was one of\nthe drawbacks.\nOne afternoon, Luo Xiaolei asked me what I thought about teaching in\nChina, and I realized that it was a difficult question.\n“Mostly I like it very much,” I said, “and especially I like the students. I\nthink they respect teachers more than we do in America. I teach literature,\nand that’s also good; my Chinese students like poetry more than most\nAmerican students do. But I don’t like the political system in the college. It’s\nhard to explain—sometimes this system affects the students. Many of their\nideas are very xia’aide—narrow.”\nTeacher Kong had taught me that word near the end of the semester, and\nit summarized the difficult aspects of Fuling. Luo Xiaolei nodded. “Probably\nthey aren’t used to waiguoren yet,” he said. “In remote parts of China you\nknow that we have not had very many.”\n“I know, but there are other problems, too. Their books are bad, and\nsometimes what they study isn’t true.”\nI asked his daughter, who was sitting with us, if they studied Confucius in\nthe Chinese department of her college.",
        "“No,” she said.\n“But you study Marx?”\n“Yes.”\n“It’s the same way in Fuling. My students read Shakespeare and Marx,\nbut they don’t read Confucius. Those are foreign ideas, and Confucius is part\nof your culture, but nobody studies him anymore.”\n“Did you study Marx in college in America?” she asked.\n“Yes, but only a little. Many college students do in America, because he’s\na philosopher.”\n“What do they think of Marxism in your America?”\n“Most people think it is interesting, but it’s not very…” I was groping for\nthe word and she knew what I was thinking.\n“Shiyong, “she said. “Useful.”\n“Right. It’s not very useful.”\n“I agree,” she said. “I think it’s a waste of time. Most of the politics we\nstudy are a waste of time.” She flipped her hair away from her face and\nlooked across the room at her father. He was thinking of something else, and\nthen he smiled when he realized that his daughter expected him to respond.\nHe was a gray-haired man with round glasses and his eyes were bright with\nmemory.\n“No,” he said. “Marxism is not very useful.” And his own father, who\nwas sitting in the shadows eating watermelon, said nothing at all.\nI FOLLOWED A REGULAR ROUTINE IN YULIN, visiting the Luos\nduring the morning and eating at a small restaurant in the afternoon. The\nrestaurant had good dumplings, along with cheap local beer, and the owner\nwas the sort of tough no-nonsense woman who could often be found in places\nwhere men went drinking after work. She teased me about my accent, which\nshe said was half foreign and half Sichuanese, and whenever other customers\ncame into the restaurant she announced my vital information: nationality, age,\nChinese name, danwei, and salary. Usually the customers remarked the\nlowness of my salary and bought me a beer. To maintain my dignity, I\nexplained the nature of the Peace Corps, and how we had come to build\nfriendship between America and China rather than make money, which",
        "invariably inspired the customers to buy me another beer. I tried to cover the\nthird round, usually without success. After that we would shake hands\nwarmly and say something about the improving relations between our\nnations, and I would return to my hotel and sleep until it cooled to evening.\nOn my last day in Yulin, two men in their late twenties came into the\nrestaurant and began buying me drinks. One of them was named Wang and\nthe other was Zhao. They said I could call them Comrade. It was Friday and\nthey had just finished working the morning shift in a nearby factory.\nEach of us finished two beers quickly, and during the next beer the two\nmen began to turn red and tell stories about Chinese history. Comrade Wang\ntold me about Emperor Yu, who had been the first to control the floods of the\nYellow River. This was a story I had studied in my textbook, which was\nfortunate because Comrade Wang’s version frequently became entangled in\nthe local dialect. I kept nodding and acting as if I understood, and\nperiodically Comrade Zhao would interrupt him:\n“Speak Mandarin! He’s not going to understand if you speak the dialect!”\nComrade Wang would nod and speak a few sentences in Mandarin, and\nthen he would drift back toward the dialect as Emperor Yu made more heroic\nefforts to build dikes and levees along the Yellow River. The gist of the tale\nwas that Emperor Yu had worked so hard that although he often passed the\ndoorway of his family home, he never had time to stop and visit. It was a hell\nof a project, controlling the Yellow River.\nFinally the river was under control and Comrade Wang sat back and\ndrained his beer. They were buying bottles and our table was full of empties.\nOne of the many good things about small Chinese restaurants was that they\nnever cleared the bottles until you left, which meant that passersby could\nglance over and see how much damage you had done by two in the afternoon.\nThere was big face in that and today we were doing fine.\n“Did you understand the story?” Comrade Zhao asked. “You didn’t\nunderstand, did you? He kept speaking our dialect!”\nI said that everything was clear, reciting the version from my textbook.\n“You see?” Comrade Wang was triumphant. “He understood all of it!”\nThere was a sudden need to show me Comrade Wang’s investment down\nthe street, and the owner agreed to hold our table until we returned. They\nwere both big men, and I walked between them, the three of us stumbling\nunsteadily over the cobblestones. We passed Mr. Luo’s stand and I waved. I",
        "had no idea where we were going, or what the investment was—that was all\nthey said, that we were going to see Comrade Wang’s investment. It was a\nhot afternoon and after the beer we were sweating as we walked down the\nstreet.\nWe entered a doorway and climbed a narrow flight of stairs. On the\nsecond floor there was a big room and a single girl in roller skates was\nspinning around the hardwood floor.\n“This,” said Comrade Wang, “is my investment.”\nProudly he looked out over the roller rink, and then he went over to the\nconcessions area and talked with the worker.\n“The investment was too much,” Comrade Zhao whispered mournfully,\nonce Comrade Wang was out of earshot. “He had to borrow too much money.\nHe’ll never pay it back!”\nI could see that Comrade Wang was telling the worker something about\nme and I strained to hear.\n“They don’t have enough people coming,” Comrade Zhao whispered.\n“And last night there was a fight and some glass was broken. He’s going to\nlose so much money!”\nComrade Wang returned with roller skates and presented them to me.\n“Here,” he said. “You skate. Now. For free.”\nI stuttered, explaining that I didn’t know how to roller-skate. “Of course\nyou know how!” said Comrade Wang. “It comes from your country!”\nI told them that I had a hurt leg, and they offered to take me to a doctor.\nThere was one down the street, Comrade Zhao said, and Chinese medicine\nwas very effective. I explained that I knew the benefits of Chinese medicine,\nbecause a Chinese doctor had told me to sit down as much as possible and\navoid activities like roller-skating. After many polite offers and protests, we\nsolved the problem by going back to the restaurant, sitting down, and having\nanother beer. They didn’t seem offended; Comrade Wang was pleased that he\nhad been able to show me his investment. The empties were still on the table.\nWe finished another round and Comrade Wang looked me in the eye.\n“He Wei,” he said, using my Chinese name. “The only other time I saw\nan American was on Mount Emei, and I didn’t have a good impression. He\nwas very fat, and he was telling people to do things for him. “Do this! Do\nthat!” He had workers carry him up the mountain, like he was a great\nlandlord. But you’re different—before I met you, I thought that all Americans",
        "are bad, but now I know that’s not the truth.”\nI was touched, and I felt guilty that I had lied about seeing the doctor. But\nit was a Chinese type of white lie and probably that made it all right. I\nthanked Comrade Wang and we toasted each other.\n“Also, that American on Mount Emei was very white,” he said. “His skin\nwas so white and bad-looking! But you’re actually a little yellow—you look\nmore Chinese. Your skin is much better than his!”\nEVERYTHING WENT WELL that summer. I studied at a college in Xi’an,\nwhere the classes were not too difficult, and the city had plenty of good parks\nwhere you could buy a cup of tea and chat with the locals. Every day it was\nthirty-five degrees Celsius (ninety-five degrees Fahrenheit). Supposedly the\ngovernment had a policy that if the temperature reached thirty-seven degrees\neverybody was given the rest of the day off, and so they always announced\nthe official temperature as thirty-five. Often I rode a friend’s bicycle over to\nXingqing Palace Park, where I’d get a cup of tea and ask the workers what\nthe temperature was.\n“Thirty-five degrees,” they’d say, fanning themselves with newspapers.\n“What was the temperature yesterday?”\n“Thirty-five degrees.”\n“How hot do you think it’ll be tomorrow?”\nThey’d roll their eyes and tell me to go drink my tea; it wasn’t much of a\njoke to them. China was perhaps the only country in the world where the\ngovernment controlled the temperature, although two years later the Beijing\nweather stations finally started announcing the temperature as it actually was.\nLocal newspapers hailed this development as an important step toward telling\ncitizens the truth, and perhaps it was: today the temperature, tomorrow the\nfull report on the Tiananmen Square massacre. But the government also made\nit clear that the policy of giving a day off was merely a myth, so the new\ntemperatures didn’t result in any vacations. It just meant that you knew\nexactly how hot it really was.\nXi’an was the hottest thirty-five degrees imaginable and at night I had\ntrouble sleeping, but even with the heat everything went well that summer.\nMy sister Angela, who was a graduate student in geology at Stanford, had",
        "been sent out to a summer project in Xinjiang, the province in the far west of\nChina. She spent a week with me in Xi’an and together we saw the historical\nsights of the city. I always told people that she was helping China find oil in\nXinjiang, while I was a volunteer English teacher in Sichuan; this pleased\neveryone and they gave us special treatment. The worker at the terra-cotta\nwarriors museum was so inspired that he let us in for the Chinese price,\nwaiving the waiguoren surcharge, because of the good work we were doing\nfor China.\nAngela flew out to her project, and a week later I finished my studies and\ncaught a train to Xinjiang. It was a forty-eight-hour trip along the old Silk\nRoad, through the deserts of Gansu and Xinjiang provinces, and I had always\nliked long train trips and big empty landscapes.\nI traveled hard sleeper, which I considered to be the most enjoyable class\non a Chinese train. Hard seat was a nightmare, a crush of peasants and\nmigrant workers; soft sleeper was too much in the other direction, cadres and\noverfed businessmen and waiguoren tourists. Hard sleeper cars weren’t\nuncomfortable—everybody had a berth—but the tickets were cheap enough\nfor travelers who considered themselves Old Hundred Names, the common\npeople. Old Hundred Names were always easy to talk with, especially on\ntrains, where they chatted lightly, drinking their tea and eating instant\nnoodles.\nOn the first day, a young man from Hebei province came and sat across\nfrom me, watching the Gansu hills slip past. He was twenty-five years old,\nand he had worked in Xinjiang for two years, and he did not like it. Xinjiang\nwas too extreme, he said—too hot in the summer, too cold in the winter. He\nhad just finished four months of vacation, and it was not pleasant to take a\nforty-eight-hour train trip and know that at its conclusion you had to start\nwork again in a place like Xinjiang. His job involved safety management for\nan oil company.\n“Every year, two or three workers are killed,” he said. “Especially on the\nroads in the desert. The transportation is terrible in Xinjiang, and that’s why\nworkers die every year. There’s not much we can do about it.”\nI told him that my younger sister was looking for oil near Turpan. He\nshrugged, as if to say: She can have it. Outside there was a dusty streak of\nlow hills and the land was getting steadily drier as the train rocked west.\nHe was bright and it wasn’t the sort of rote conversation that I often had",
        "in China. There was something quietly sharp about his eyes—he had a heavy-\nlidded gaze but I could see that he took careful notice of everything around\nhim. He saw that I was jotting in my notebook, but unlike most people he\ndidn’t ask what I was writing, probably because he guessed the truth. Usually\nI told people that it was my diary, or sometimes I simply said, “I’m writing\nmy foreign language.” That was enough to satisfy nearly everyone—if you\nknew a foreign language, it was obvious that you would spend a great deal of\ntime writing it. Nobody seemed to realize that in fact I was writing about\nthem and everything else around me, but the man from Hebei watched my\npen skim impulsively over the pages and I sensed that he knew that he was\nbeing described. But he still spoke freely; we talked lightly about politics,\nand the Communist Party, and I asked him if he was a member.\n“No,” he said. “I don’t want to be.”\n“Why not?”\n“Too much trouble. My friends—and most young people—all of us are\nthe same. We’re not interested in that. It’s not the same as your America. We\nonly have one party in our China.”\nThe differences between these countries interested him. “All Chinese like\nAmericans,” he said, a while later. “But many Americans think there are\nproblems with human rights here. In fact, Old Hundred Names doesn’t care\nabout that. Old Hundred Names worries about eating, about having enough\nclothes. Look out there.”\nHe pointed out the window—a dusty village, garbage beside the tracks, a\nskinny donkey followed by a peasant in blue. Old Hundred Names.\n“Do you think people like that worry about democracy?” he said. “They\nneed to improve their living standard and then they can start thinking about\nother things. That’s the problem with America and China—you can’t\ncompare them in the same breath.”\nWe slipped away from politics; he talked of marriage and how after three\nmore years he would find a wife. There were often schedules like this for the\nyoung Chinese I knew; they were pragmatists about love as well as politics\nand nearly everything else. The young man explained his reasons—in three\nyears he would be twenty-eight years old, which was neither too old nor too\nyoung, and by then he should have enough money to get married. It took a\ngreat deal of money to marry, he said, and it wasn’t something you wanted to\ndo in a place like Xinjiang. In three years he hoped to live in Hebei, or",
        "perhaps Qingdao, the former German concession on the east coast. He spoke\nlovingly of Qingdao, of the beautiful red roofs and the clean streets, the\nfriendly people and the calm sea; and meanwhile our train rocked steadily\nwest into the desert.\nIt was a long, empty day—nothing to see out the window, nothing to do\non the train. I sat and talked with people for a couple of hours, and then I\nclimbed up to my bunk. We passed through Lanzhou, the capital of Gansu\nprovince, where the smog hung limp above the sullen stain of the Yellow\nRiver, and I fell asleep. When I awoke everything had changed—we were in\na bright landscape of green grass and yellow rapeseed, and dune-shaped hills\nrolled off toward the horizon.\nA fertilizer salesman materialized and began to ask me questions about\nmoney. How much is a new car in America? A used car? What about the\nlicense fee? Taxes? Insurance? In a notebook he scrawled my responses—\nguesses, all of them—and I was glad to see that somebody else on this train\nwas writing. But what were they growing in this desolate place that required\nfertilizer?\n“Wheat and corn,” he said. “Of course, there are grapes as well, and other\nfruit, but there are grain crops near Urumqi. But the fertilizer we make is\nshipped back into the interior.” He returned to the money questions: How\nmuch is a house in America? What are the unemployment benefits? What\nkind of insurance does the government give you?\nAfter that was finished we sat in silence, looking out the window. I felt I\nshould continue the conversation, but there were only so many questions you\ncould ask about fertilizer. I asked him when he had come to Xinjiang.\n“I was born here,” he said.\n“When did your parents come?”\n“My parents came to Xinjiang in the 1950s, after Liberation. They came\nto help build the country. It was like America.”\nWe stared at the scene outside: a shepherd with his flock in a green field,\na man in blue riding a bicycle along a dusty road, a row of mud houses\nsurrounded by earth-colored walls, a range of craggy white peaks to the\nsouth, and, westward, a broad empty horizon of the sort I had rarely seen in\nChina. There were no trees for miles.\n“Go west, young man,” said the fertilizer salesman, remembering a\nphrase from history class long ago.",
        "SOMETIME DURING THE SECOND NIGHT our train passed Jiayu\nPass, the westernmost fort of the Great Wall. I didn’t see that barrier, but in\nthe morning it was clear that a line had been crossed. There were no villages\nor walls, only rocks and dust and low rugged hills that were sharply\nshadowed by the desert sun.\nWe had come to the edge of China—or rather, a figurative edge of China,\nbecause you could continue westward for another thousand miles and still be\nwithin the country’s borders. But this was the end of where the Han, or ethnic\nChinese, traditionally lived, and now we were reaching the uncertain regions\nof the Silk Road. The Chinese called this province the Xinjiang Uighur\nAutonomous Region; the Uighurs were the indigenous people, and they\ncalled this land Turkistan or Uighurstan, and they wanted it for themselves.\nXinjiang means New Frontier, and for more than two thousand years it\nhad slipped in and out of China, until at last the Communists took firm\ncontrol of the region in 1949. But it was a difficult place to govern—it\nbordered Tibet, India, Pakistan, Tajikstan, Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan,\nMongolia; it composed one-sixth of China’s total land area, containing a\nwealth of oil and minerals; and the majority of its residents, the Uighurs,\nwere Muslims who spoke a Turkish tongue and had nothing in common with\nthe Han Chinese. All of these factors made Xinjiang a complex place, and in\nFebruary of that year there had been violence in the northern reaches of the\nprovince. For them the most immediate issue was keeping the Han out—four\ndecades ago, only 15 percent of the region’s population had been Chinese,\nbut now that figure had swelled to nearly 50 percent. The Han came to do\nmany jobs—to work as soldiers, as government cadres, as fertilizer salesmen\n—and they kept coming, arriving on trains like this. In my car there was not a\nsingle Uighur, but there were plenty of Han who were heading west to work.\nThe tension was something that nobody on the train wanted to talk about\n—a few times I asked about the problems of the spring, but everybody was\nevasive. A woman in her forties told me that she didn’t understand the issue,\nbecause she was simply Old Hundred Names. That was the best part of being\nOld Hundred Names—they were never responsible for anything. It was the\nsame way in any country where the citizens spoke of themselves as the",
        "“common people,” but in China there was a much higher percentage of Old\nHundred Names than in most places. Virtually everybody you met described\nhimself as such, and none of them claimed to have anything to do with the\nway things worked.\nAfter establishing herself as Old Hundred Names, the woman started\nasking me Da Shan questions. Da Shan was a Canadian who spoke Chinese\nfluently and appeared frequently on television, and he was without a doubt\nthe most famous waiguoren in China. He was what people called a\nZhongguotong—a foreigner who “knew about China,” or, essentially, a\nChina hand. On good language days people referred to me as a\nZhongguotong, but I knew it was only flattery. I had a long way to go before\nI could be accepted a China hand, and from what I had seen of Da Shan, this\nwasn’t a particularly appealing goal. Probably he was a nice enough person,\nbut in his “cross-talk” comedy routines and opera singing there was more\nthan a touch of the trained monkey.\nPeople everywhere asked me about Da Shan, and his fame testified to\nhow badly foreigners did with the Chinese language. It was the equivalent of\nAmericans becoming fascinated with a Chinese person simply because he\nspoke idiomatic English.\n“Do you know Da Shan?” the woman asked. “You speak our Chinese\nwell, but you’re not as good as Da Shan.”\n“Yes, he speaks much better than me.” This was why most waiguoren in\nChina hated Da Shan: the more your Chinese improved, and the more you\nchatted with Old Hundred Names, the more you heard about Da Shan and\nhow much better than you he was.\n“Do you know him?” the woman asked. This was another common\nassumption—that all waiguoren who studied Chinese knew each other,\nmaintaining contact through an intricate nationwide system, like the\nFreemasons.\n“No,” I said. “I have never met Da Shan.”\n“He’s very good at the cross-talk—he’s very funny.”\n“Dui. I’ve seen him do it. Indeed he is very good.”\n“Da Shan speaks Mandarin better than most Chinese,” the woman said.\n“Yes. That is what many people tell me.”\n“And he can sing our traditional Chinese songs. Is he from your\nAmerica?”",
        "“No. He’s from their Canada.”\n“What do people in your America think of Da Shan?”\n“We don’t have Da Shan on television in our America. Nobody in our\nAmerica knows who he is.”\n“So he’s only on television in their Canada?”\n“He’s not on television in their Canada, either. The only place where he is\non television is China.”\nFor the woman, like many of the Chinese that I met, this was a great\ndisappointment. It was tragic for a nation to produce somebody as gifted as\nDa Shan and allow a foreign country to monopolize his skills. But in fact, as I\nexplained to the woman, this is a common pattern in Canada, where all talent\nleaves the country as soon as possible, just like NHL franchises. She thought\nabout this for a while and then continued talking about Da Shan.\n“He has a Chinese wife,” she said. “Have you heard that?”\n“Yes,” I said. I had heard every theory there was about Da Shan.\nOccasionally people said that his grandmother was Chinese, which seemed\nunlikely given that he was blond. His Chinese teacher had also become\nfamous, and sometimes people recommended that I move to the east of China\nand seek out this pedagogue, the way itinerant scholars had done more than\ntwo thousand years ago during the Spring and Autumn Period. I had a good\nstart in Chinese, they said, and it was a shame to waste that in a place like\nSichuan, where even the locals couldn’t speak the language.\n“Do you know what Da Shan’s salary is?” I asked. I wanted to talk about\nanything else, and money sounded promising.\n“He makes thousands of yuan every month,” the woman said with\ncertainty. “He has a very good salary. How much do you make?”\n“One thousand yuan.”\n“That’s not as much as Da Shan.”\n“No,” I said. “It’s not as much as Da Shan.”\n“But it’s enough,” she said. “For a young man who is single, one\nthousand yuan is enough.”\n“Yes. It’s a better salary than most people in Fuling, where I live. Have\nyou heard of Fuling? It’s in Sichuan.”\nShe thought hard and shook her head.\n“I’m sure you’ve heard of Fuling hot pickled mustard tuber,” I said. “It’s\nvery famous in China. Have you seen the advertisements on television?” And",
        "I sang the jingle:\nWu River brand,\nFuling hot pickled mustard tuber!\nIt sounded much better in Chinese than it does in English, and the woman\nrecognized it immediately. All of the Chinese were familiar with Fuling hot\npickled mustard tuber and that was the easiest way to tell people where I was\nfrom. The woman and I talked for a while longer, and then she said\nsomething tactful about our China becoming more open to foreign countries.\nI thanked her and she returned to her part of the car.\nThe train grew hotter as we passed into the Turpan-Hami Basin, where\nthe earth beside the tracks was cracked by the sun. The hills in the distance\ndropped steadily, and with them the horizon fell lower and lower, until at last\nthe land was perfectly flat and the clear sky sat like a great dome of blue\nstretched taut above the black earth.\nWe stopped for an hour in the oasis city of Hami, where the station signs\nwere in Arabic script as well as Chinese. It was the first place on this journey\nwhere I saw Uighurs; they were standing on the station platform, selling\ngrapes and melons. The Uighurs had long sun-browned noses, and their\nfeatures would have been at home in Saudi Arabia, or Turkey, or even Italy.\nCenturies ago many of them were caravan people, nomads who bought and\nsold along the Silk Road, and even today some spark of that same spirit\ninspires them to travel across China in search of business. Uighurs often work\nas black-market moneychangers in big cities, where they also sell raisins and\nfruitcake. Even in Fuling it is common for a couple of them to set up a\nfruitcake and raisin stand on a downtown street. They follow the Yangtze\nwith their bushel baskets, drifting east, stopping in a city for a few weeks and\nthen moving on. Of all the small entrepreneurs I saw in China, the Uighurs\nwere the most remarkable—you’d find them two thousand miles away from\nhome, and yet all they had was a basket of raisins and a tray of fruitcake. I\nhad no idea how they made money.\nAt Hami the safety management worker and I stood there watching the\nfruit salesmen, and I asked him about relations between the Han and the",
        "Uighurs.\n“We have problems,” he said. “Sometimes the guanxi is bad. Now our\ngovernment helps their education, agriculture, economy, but still there are\nproblems. It’s because of the history, not today’s policy. Every country has\nthis kind of trouble—you have the same kind of problems with blacks in your\nAmerica.”\nIt was a good point, and I told him that I didn’t think Xinjiang’s troubles\nwere America’s affair. But I said that if it was a Chinese affair, it seemed\nstrange that the violence in the spring hadn’t been discussed in the\nnewspapers in Chongqing and Fuling.\n“Sichuan is too remote. Bigger cities heard about what happened here.”\n“What happened?”\n“There were bombs,” he said, shrugging. “It was like Israel.”\n“Does your company have any Uighur workers?”\n“No. Their education level isn’t high enough, and if it’s not high enough,\nit’s not safe. If their level was appropriate, we’d hire them.”\n“Do you speak Uighur?”\n“No. You don’t need it here. You always use Chinese at work and when\nyou go shopping.”\n“Do you know any words?”\n“I know a few. Salaam aleikum is ‘hello.’ And ‘thank you’ is…”\nHe paused, thinking hard. He had lived in the Uighur Autonomous\nRegion for two years. “I forget,” he said at last. “But I know ‘goodbye.’”\nAnd he said it, but he spoke softly and the word was lost in the hot desert\nwind that swept through the station.\nTHE OASIS TOWNS appeared every hour or two, rising suddenly\nalongside the tracks and then disappearing just as quickly into the rock and\ndirt and sand. They weren’t oases in the romantic sense: no palms or shining\npools of water; just concrete and dust and glass. It was as if the oases and the\ndesert had been reversed; we would roll out of town and I would breathe a\nsigh of relief, unable to imagine that once these places had been inviting to\ntravellers. The land was barren but it was also mesmerizing, and the towns\nhad no charm.",
        "I would have been happy to continue like that for days, passing from\noasis to oasis, watching the great nothingness beside the tracks. The train was\ncomfortable and the people friendly; I was the only waiguoren of our car and\noften the other passengers brought me food and drink—tomatoes, cucumbers,\nflavored ices, dried fish, beer. Occasionally somebody stopped by to talk\nabout prices or Sino-American relations, but at last it was as if the wasteland\nhad swallowed all conversation. Nearly everybody sat silent, staring out at\nthe scenery.\nThe Flaming Mountains rose to the south, red and scarred by countless\nridges, and then the Heavenly Mountains came into view. Snow was streaked\nbright in the high peaks. It grew dark; a full moon hung heavy in the eastern\nsky. The train rocked westward. It seemed we’d never get to Urumqi, but I\ndidn’t care.\nTHERE WERE CHECKPOINTS on the Xinjiang highways where\npolicemen with machine guns inspected all vehicles. It was unusual for\nChinese policemen to handle weapons like that, and in Xinjiang they were\nvery proud of the responsibility, fiddling constantly with the clip and the\nhandle. They couldn’t simply carry the guns on their straps—the point of\nhaving a weapon was to keep it constantly in their hands, aimed at something.\nIt was like giving an automatic rifle to a child. I took a bus from Urumqi to\nTurpan, and the policeman at the checkpoint used the barrel of his machine\ngun to motion bluntly at the passengers as he inspected our identification.\nThe tension in the big cities was palpable; conversations with Uighurs\ndidn’t last very long before they started complaining. They complained about\nthe number of Han migrants, and they complained about how all the good\ngovernment jobs went to the Han, and they complained about the planned-\nbirth policy, even though for Uighurs the limit was extended to two children\nand was imposed only in urban areas. I wasn’t particularly surprised to see\nthat the problems of the spring hadn’t blown over; everything I had learned\nabout the Chinese suggested that they would be particularly bad colonists.\nThey tended to have strong ideas about race, they rarely respected religion,\nand they had trouble considering a non-Chinese point of view. One of the\nbest characteristics of the people I knew in Fuling was that they had a",
        "powerful pride in their own culture—I had never lived in a place where the\npeople had such a strong sense of their unique cultural identity. Despite the\nself-destruction of the Cultural Revolution and the subsequent rush to open to\nthe outside world, there was still a definite sense of what was Chinese, and I\nbelieved that this would help them survive modernization. But there was also\na narrowness to this concept, and it seemed nearly impossible for a Chinese\nto go to a place like Xinjiang, learn the language, and make friends with the\nlocals. In the five thousand years of their history it was striking how little\ninterest the Chinese had had in exploration, and today that same characteristic\nlimited them, even within their own borders. They seemed completely\ncontent in being Chinese, and they assumed that this feeling was shared by\neverybody else.\nWhen the Han went to western places like Xinjiang or Tibet, their initial\nreaction was that the people needed to become more like the country’s\ninterior, particularly with regard to modernization, even if it came at the\nexpense of culture. I had trouble understanding this perspective; to me it\nseemed that already too many beautiful places had been modernized too\nquickly, and I felt that the relatively untouched corners of China should be\nleft that way. But I had never been poor, which made a great difference in the\nway you saw a place like Xinjiang.\nEverything looked different to the average Chinese, and I had gained\nsome sense of their perspective when my writing class studied the American\nWest in the fall. We discussed Western expansion, and I presented my\nstudents with a dilemma of the late nineteenth century: the Plains Indians,\ntheir culture in jeopardy, were being pressed by white settlers. I asked my\nclass to imagine that they were American citizens proposing a solution, and\nnearly all responded like the following two students:\nThe Indians should become a part of American society like everyone\nelse. Even though they are poor and savage, we can help them found\nreservations to make them civilized, and give them advanced\nknowledges and experiences to change their lifestyle and develop their\neconomy. By this way, we can make them become rich and be suited for\nmodern life. At last, the Indians can get along well with us and advance\ntogether.",
        "The world is changing and developing. We should make the Indians\nsuit our modern life. The Indians are used to living all over the plains\nand moving frequently, without a fixed home, but it is very impractical\nin our modern life…. We need our country to be a powerful country; we\nmust make the Indians adapt to our modern life and keep pace with the\nsociety. Only in this way can we strengthen the country.\nThat was the first time I realized how different our perspectives were on\nprogress and modernization. If anything, I had presented them with an\nidealized version of the Plains Indians, and yet the lifestyle and culture had\nno appeal to my students. But like most Chinese, the majority were but one\ngeneration removed from serious poverty. What I saw as freedom and\nculture, they saw as misery and ignorance.\nAnd Xinjiang, as well as Tibet, looked much the same. The Han that I\nmet in Xinjiang couldn’t understand why the Uighurs didn’t appreciate\nChina’s efforts; they pointed out how backward the region had been before\nLiberation, emphasizing the work that had been done by the government.\nThere was no question that this was true—the government had built roads,\nrailways, schools. But the Chinese had failed to take the logical first step;\nthey had never made a serious effort to understand and respect the Uighur\nculture, and settlers rarely learned the local language. The result was that\ntremendous amounts of money and work had been sunk into the desert, but\nwith regard to improving relations much of it had been completely wasted.\nI found myself oddly situated in the middle of this tension. The Uighurs\ndisliked speaking the language of the Han, and in tourist areas some of them\nspoke better Japanese or English than Chinese. There was a certain distrust of\nforeigners who spoke Chinese; it was better if you used English. This was\nhard for me to do—all summer I had enjoyed the benefits of becoming\nconversational in Chinese, but now my use of the language established me as\nan outsider, and a politically charged outsider at that.\nIn addition to the language, there was a host of new cultural rules that\ncomplicated my interactions with the Uighurs. They were very different",
        "people from the Chinese I knew in Fuling—the Uighurs showed emotion,\nangering easily, and I found bargaining unpleasant because sometimes the\nroutine involved a mock show of anger or disgust. I missed the even\npredictability of the Chinese; I was accustomed to their social rules, and I\nknew how they would react to the things I did and said. There was something\ncomforting about all of those rote dialogues—the conversations about my\nsalary, U.S.-China relations, and Da Shan. In Xinjiang I found myself\ngravitating to Chinese restaurants and shops, and especially I liked talking\nwith the Sichuanese, who had migrated to Xinjiang in large numbers. After a\nsummer on the road it was good to hear their slurred tones again—much\nmore soothing than the Turkic trills of the Uighur tongue. And I realized that\nI had picked up some of that distinctly Chinese narrowness: I was also\ncontent in being Chinese, even here in Xinjiang.\nBut things were different if I didn’t say anything. I have some Italian\nancestry and don’t look too much different from the Uighurs, and I could\nwalk down the street and not attract attention. Occasionally I was mistaken\nfor a native—the Chinese sometimes asked if I was a Uighur, and the\nUighurs sometimes asked if I was a Kazakh. In Fuling I was always\nextremely conscious of my appearance, because every day I was confronted\nby the ways in which I looked different from the locals, but now in these\ndesert towns I saw people with noses and hair and eyes like mine. For the\nfirst time I realized the full importance of race, not just in the way it divided\npeople, but also in the sense of feeling a link to those who looked like you.\nFor a year I hadn’t felt that connection, but here in Xinjiang, although the\nlink was tenuous, it was better than nothing.\nMy vacation was winding down, but I had no eagerness to leave. I liked\nthe lazy freedom of traveling, and I liked the uncertainty of my position here\nin Xinjiang, where I had no job and even my race was in question. It was a\nvague place—even time was uncertain here. All of China is on one time zone,\nwhich meant that in Xinjiang the sun didn’t rise until eight or nine o’clock\nand it set after ten at night. Most of the people followed a more practical\nschedule, based on a mythical local time zone that was two hours later than\nthe one in Beijing, but all of the government offices and state-run\ntransportation followed the official standard time. It was the perfect symbol\nof the divide between the government and the governed, both of them living\nin the same place but going about their separate routines a full two hours",
        "apart.\nMostly in Xinjiang I liked the brutal landscapes. For three days I camped\nat altitudes of more than ten thousand feet in the Heavenly Mountains, and a\nday later I was in Turpan, where the desert basin dipped to five hundred feet\nbelow sea level and the Flaming Mountains rose north of town. Turpan was\nso hot that even the government couldn’t control the temperature. Every day I\nwas there, it reached forty-two degrees, 107 Fahrenheit, and it was reported\nas such. Shops closed during midday, so everybody could rest inside until the\nworst of the heat had passed.\nIt was almost as hot in Hami, where my sister Angela was looking at\nrocks. Along with another Stanford geologist, she was employed by a\nChinese state-owned oil company that had built an entire city outside of\nHami. It was literally a city—schools, hospitals, shops, apartment buildings;\neverything was neatly laid out on well-planned streets that had been desert\nwasteland but four years ago. There were fifty thousand employees who\nworked there, all of them Han Chinese who had been shipped in from Gansu\nprovince. When I went to the market, people mistook me for a Uighur,\nbecause they had seen so few of the locals. The Chinese rarely left the\ncomplex; everything they needed was provided by their oil-built oasis in the\ndesert.\nAnd yet the city was a mirage. There wasn’t much oil in Hami, at least\naccording to Angela and her colleague, who knew the region’s geology. All\nof it was a mystery—why had they built the city here in the desert? Why had\nall of these people been transferred out to this desolate place? What were they\nlooking for? In five hundred years, would it be like the Great Wall, money\nand work buried in the sand? What was it about the Chinese that made them\ncome slightly unhinged in the border regions—what inspired them to build\nwalls, forts, cities; why did they construct Ozymandian monstrosities in the\nfar reaches of their country? And what prevented them from actually talking\nwith the people who lived there?\nBut these were mysteries that I didn’t have time to untangle. I was in\nHami for three short days—I stayed in Angela’s hotel, along with Adam\nWeiss, another Peace Corps volunteer, who had met me in Turpan. And then\nour time was up, and Weiss and I left the city in the desert, catching a train\nback to Chengdu.",
        "THE TRAIN TO CHENGDU TOOK FIFTY HOURS and I had a bad\nfeeling about it from the moment Weiss and I tried to buy tickets. They\nwouldn’t sell us sleeper berths at the Hami station, and all they said was that\nwe could try to upgrade our hard seat tickets once we boarded.\nSchool was about to start, and the train was full of college students who\nwere returning to Sichuan. There weren’t any sleeping berths left, and there\nweren’t any open spots in the hard seat cars. People were stuffed in the aisles,\nsitting on their luggage, leaning against each other. The walkways between\ncars were packed with passengers squatting on the floor. People sat in the\nsinks. It was the most crowded train I had ever seen in China.\nFifty hours is a long time to ride on a train without seats. For the first\nnight Weiss and I did the best we could in the aisle, sitting on our bags, but it\nwas impossible to sleep and always there were people coming through and\nbumping us. The worker in charge of our car was annoyed by the crowd, and\nout of spite she mopped the entire carriage three times during the first\nevening. In order for her to do this, all of us had to stand up and hold our\nluggage over our heads while she pushed at our feet with the dirty mop. She\nmopped at eight o’clock, ten o’clock, and midnight. Everybody grumbled but\nnobody resisted; in China you tolerated the bad behavior of the people who\nwere employed to serve you, the same way you tolerated bullies and all other\nhassles of that sort. Or you tried to leave, which is what Weiss and I finally\ndid, scouting out a different car where the worker seemed more reasonable. It\nwas an improvement, but we were still standing in the aisle as the train\nplodded east through the desert.\nIt wasn’t the sort of trip that inspires positive thoughts. Weiss and I\ndiscussed other Peace Corps volunteers in our group, and things they did that\nannoyed us, and we talked about the new volunteers who had recently arrived\nand how badly they would do this year. We complained about the various\nwaiguoren we had seen over the course of the summer. We watched the other\npassengers in the car, criticizing their flaws. We discussed things we would\ndo and eat whenever we returned to America. We reviewed the most\noffensive rap lyrics from the Notorious B.I.G.’s recent album, and we talked\nabout what the Notorious B.I.G. would do on a train like this, and how his\nreaction would be distinct from that of Snoop Doggy Dogg. Neither of the",
        "rappers would like the train very much, we decided. At least ten times an\nhour I looked at my watch.\nI rarely glanced out the windows, and I couldn’t read. Sometimes I\nlistened to my Walkman, but I hadn’t brought enough tapes. Mostly I was too\nexhausted to speak Chinese, although in the afternoon I had a long\nconversation with a group of students who were on their way to Chengdu.\nBut that was a very calculated effort; I figured that if they realized we were\nteachers they might share their seats, out of respect. Sure enough, after thirty\nminutes’ conversation they kindly offered us a spot on the end of their bench.\nFor the second night Weiss and I shared the seat in shifts, one standing while\nthe other sat, but the seat wasn’t comfortable and neither of us slept for more\nthan ten minutes at a stretch.\nTime crept, especially when I was standing, and to pass the evening I did\nsomething that I often did in China when things got rough. I remembered\nother places I had visited, thinking about what I had liked the most about\nthem—a comfortable hotel, or a good restaurant, or the way a river wound\nthrough a green valley. I spent some time thinking about which part of the\nworld was the perfect opposite of this particular Chinese train, and at last I\ndecided that it was Switzerland. To distract myself I recalled some of the long\nhikes I had taken there, and in my mind I walked them over again. I\nremembered a certain stretch of the Swiss Valais where I had hiked up hard\nfrom the Val d’Anniviers, because night had been falling, and I remembered\ncamping high above St. Luc. My clothes were damp with the effort of the\nclimb, and I put the tent up quickly, because it was growing cold; and then I\nwent to sleep.\nThe next morning I climbed the Bella Tola. It was early summer and the\nmountain was still snow-covered, and the ice was streaked red with Sahara\nsand that had been blown across the Mediterranean by the föhn winds. After\nthe Bella Tola, I continued over the Meidpass into the Turtmanntal, which is\nthe first German-speaking valley as you head east across the southern Valais.\nThe Turtmanntal is a steep empty valley with a blue glacier trembling at its\nsouthern end, and I made camp in a meadow midway up the slope to the next\npass. I arranged everything carefully, checking my tent and sleeping bag, and\nthen I went to sleep. Always I went to sleep.\nThe train rocked east and south. By the last day it was as if something\ninside of me had snapped and I was too tired to do any more walks in my",
        "mind, not even short ones around my home in Missouri. Passengers started\ngetting off after we reached Sichuan, and for the last five hours Weiss and I\nhad seats. But it was too late to do us much good and we stared ahead without\nspeaking. We reached Chengdu in early evening, and I realized that I had just\nspent two days of my life standing on a train. My summer vacation was over.\nDuring the rest of my time in the Peace Corps, I never rode another train.",
        "THE PRIEST\nIN THE OLD SECTION of Fuling City is a Catholic church, and in the\ncourtyard of the church is a propaganda sign, which consists of four lines of\nfour characters each:\nLove the Country, Love the Religion\nRespect God, Love the People\nThrow Your Body into the Four Modernizations\nServe the Masses\nThe Four Modernizations are Industry, Agriculture, Defense, and\nScience; and it is difficult to see their connection to Fuling’s Catholic church,\nwhich was constructed by French missionaries in 1861, and whose Masses\nare served by Father Li Hairou, who at eighty-three years of age is more than\nfour times as old as the Four Modernizations.\nFather Li stands well under five feet tall. Usually he wears a soft black\nberet atop his white-haired head. He has a long, proud nose—an Italian nose\nfor a Chinese Roman Catholic priest. His eyes are black, and sometimes they\nflicker and flash and show emotion when his voice, which is low and raspy,\ndoes not. Visitors occasionally remark on his brilliant white teeth, and Father\nLi responds by saying that they are a species of Modernization that cost him\ntwo hundred yuan and two months of eating nothing but rice gruel. He smiles\neasily. He walks with a dragon-headed cane. His kidneys often hurt, as does\nhis knee, and when these problems flare up he says the Mass in Latin,\nbecause it is quicker that way. If the pain is serious he does not say the Mass\nat all, but that rarely happens. He is strong, although he moves slowly, and\nthere is a pronounced dignity in his carriage. Most elderly people in China",
        "have this dignity, because they live in a culture where age commands\nunquestioned respect; and many of them, like Father Li, have an extra sense\nof pride that comes from not only the years but the bitter way so many of\nthem passed. Those bitter years are what lie behind the flash in his eyes.\nFor more than half a century, Father Li has been a priest in Fuling.\nAnywhere in the world that is a long time to be a priest. In Fuling, fifty years\nof priesthood is an eternity.\nLI HAIROU’S GREAT-GRANDFATHER was converted to Catholicism\nby French missionaries in the early 1800s. The Li family lived in Dazu, not\nfar from Chongqing, and Li Hairou was the second son of a shopkeeper. At\neleven he was sent to a French-run parochial school in Chongqing, and then\nin Chengdu he studied to be a priest. He learned French and Latin, and, like\nthe other young seminary students, he dreamed of studying in Rome. Others\nwere sent to Italy, but Li Hairou stayed, becoming a priest in 1944, at the age\nof twenty-nine. Three years later, he was sent to Fuling—remote,\nundeveloped, a distant backwater of a poor province. Perhaps in another age\nit would have been a quiet post. But the midcentury was a time when nothing\nin China was quiet, when the War of Resistance Against the Japanese was\nfollowed by the Civil War and Communist Liberation, and these were\nstruggles that touched almost everybody in the Chongqing region. Li\nHairou’s older brother died during the wars, and his younger brother, having\nfound himself on the wrong side of Liberation, fled to Singapore, where he\nmarried and became a teacher. But Father Li stayed in Fuling, serving the\nthree thousand parishioners, working with the two French priests who lived\nin the area, waiting for the ripples of revolution to make their way down the\nYangtze Valley. And then the French were gone, and the ripples came to\nshore, and Father Li had to wait no more.\n“In the 1950s,” he says, “first there was trouble because Catholicism was\nconsidered Foreign Teaching. Later, during the Great Cultural Revolution,\nthere was more trouble because they were Destroying Superstition—but that\nwas later. At first they were trying to stop Foreign Teaching, and so after\nLiberation I was sent out to the countryside. That was in 1953. I was sent to\nthe north of Fuling, about seventy miles away. The conditions were terrible.",
        "Often there wasn’t enough to eat, and many people in China starved. That\nwas the time of the dagongfan—the communal meal. They had one pot, and\none person would put in some radishes, another person put in some rice,\nanother person put in some other vegetables. But there wasn’t enough for\neverybody to eat. It was the same with the Great Leap Forward—that was a\nhuge mistake. Those were both Chairman Mao’s ideas. He didn’t understand\neconomics the way Deng Xiaoping did. What Chairman Mao liked was\nrevolution; he liked struggle. People became poorer, and the poorer you were,\nthe more you were controlled.”\nFather Li is sitting in his office, a small dark room next to the church. As\nin so many Chinese sitting rooms, the decorations are a mystery of\nquirkiness: an empty aquarium, a plastic Donald Duck, a small statue of\nMary, a slightly smaller figure of Santa Claus, a talking digital clock that\nannounces the hour in Mandarin. But by far the strangest decoration, hanging\non the wall across from Father Li, is a large photograph of Mao Zedong and\nDeng Xiaoping.\nThe black-and-white picture features the two men smiling over cups of\ntea. The chairs of both men are reclined, and the scene would not be out of\nplace in a Sichuan teahouse. But the photograph is from near the end of\nMao’s life, when Deng Xiaoping had already suffered more than his share of\ntroubles from the old man’s policies, and undoubtedly there were emotions in\nthis meeting that the camera missed. And there are certainly feelings in\nFather Li’s heart that are not reflected in the simple and careful way that he\nspeaks about the past. But there is a spark in his eyes as he glances up at the\nphotograph, and then he shakes his head and continues his story.\n“In the countryside I didn’t have my vestments. I didn’t have a Bible. I\nhad nothing—all I had was a rosary, so I said the rosary three times a day. I\nreturned to Fuling in 1955, but I didn’t come back to the church, because it\nwas closed down. I couldn’t be a priest anymore, so I was sent down to work\non the docks. My job was cleaning—mopping, sweeping, cleaning the docks.\nI made twenty-four yuan a month. It wasn’t enough, you know.\n“Often I said Mass for myself. We weren’t allowed to have a church, but\nI could say Mass alone. But once the Great Cultural Revolution started, I\ncouldn’t even do that. The Red Guards turned the church into a sock factory,\nand they always watched me. I wasn’t in jail, but I was constantly guarded,\nand the Red Guards made me do many things. Often I wore the High Hat",
        "while they criticized me, and they’d force me to kneel down and bow like\nthis”—he dips his white head and gives a short laugh, the way he often\nchuckles when he remembers the Cultural Revolution. “They’d march me\nthrough the streets with a sign that said: ‘Down with Imperialism’s Faithful\nRunning Dogs!’ I’d wear the sign like this, in front and in back, with big\ncharacters on it.”\nHe traces the ten characters on the surface of the low table in front of\nhim, stroke by stroke, dipping a finger into his tea. This is a common Chinese\nhabit when speaking with foreigners—because many characters have the\nsame sound, a conversation will sometimes pause as the speaker writes a\nword in order to clarify the meaning for the waiguoren listener. They write\nthem in the air, on the palm of their hand, in tea water on a table; and to\nwatch a Chinese person do this is to realize how unique the written language\nis, and how its words are truly shapes—not just sounds, or collections of\nletters, but tangible things that are handled and touched. And in this case the\nwords are so tangible that they were once worn in public. But Father Li says\nnothing more about that; he merely traces his ten characters on the table, and\nthe hot water steams and evaporates, and the words disappear.\n“For three years it was particularly bad,” he says. “Especially for three\nmonths. During those three months, I had four Red Guards watching me all\nday, and five times each day they took me out on the street for\ndemonstrations.”\nHis visitor asks what year that was, and Father Li pauses, muttering softly\nas he stares into space. But the date will not come to him, and at last he\nshakes his head. “I can’t remember for certain,” he says. “But that was the\nworst time. During the struggle sessions, the Red Guards used to throw things\nat me—fruit, or other hard things. All of them were students—they were\nchildren. They thought it was fun.”\nHe is not smiling now. Something in his eyes has hardened, and he points\nup at the picture of Mao. “It was his idea,” Father Li says. “His mistake.\nWhen Deng Xiaoping came to power it was different, but during the Great\nCultural Revolution it was terrible. I was never injured very badly—that\nwasn’t the problem. The problem was that I didn’t get much to eat. Every day\nthey gave me only two bowls of rice gruel. Many priests in China died during\nthat time. Most of them died because they got sick; we didn’t have enough to\neat, and all day long we couldn’t rest. In Chongqing there were many who",
        "died.”\nAgain he pauses to count, but this time the number comes to mind easily.\nHe is thinking of old friends, men he studied with, prayed with, and suffered\nwith, and because of that his memory is clear. But still there is a long pause\nbefore he responds. Perhaps in his mind he sees their faces, the way they died\nand the way he nearly died. His eyes are distant as he remembers, and then he\nspeaks again.\n“Six,” he says. “In Chongqing there were six priests who died.”\nBUT FATHER LI is not a bitter man, which is probably why he has lived so\nlong. He does not complain about today’s Communist Party, and he seems\nsincere when he says that its policies are fine; indeed, things are infinitely\nbetter than they once were. The church is in reasonably good repair, and it is\ngranted tax-free status by the government, which also provides Father Li with\na living stipend of two hundred yuan a month. The priest is allowed to say\nMass again, and his parishioners can attend without harassment. Weekday\nservices are in Latin while Sunday Mass is in the dialect.\nOn the average Sunday there are about fifty worshipers, mostly women,\nall elderly. Rarely is there anybody under forty years of age. There are no\nweddings or baptisms in the church—only funerals.\nThere are, of course, plenty of rules. Missionary work is illegal in China,\nand official connections to Rome are not allowed—a point of contention that,\nhaving strained relations between China and the Vatican for five centuries, is\nunlikely to be resolved easily.\n“We can recognize the Pope personally,” explains Father Li. “In our\nminds, in our faith, we can recognize him. If we didn’t recognize him, how\ncould you call us Catholic? Every day we pray to him. But there’s no\neconomic guanxi with Rome—they don’t give us money. And also there’s no\npolitical connection with them, and the Pope can’t come to China. He would\nlike to come but he can’t, because right now he recognizes Taiwan. If he\nrecognized China instead, then he could come. But even now there are priests\nin China who have visited Rome to see him. This year the Pope went to\nCuba, and it had been many years since he had last been there. That visit\nwent very well, too. So maybe in the future he’ll also make it to China.”",
        "These are distant issues, and Father Li seems far more concerned about\nthe problems he faces here in Fuling. He worries about his aging\nparishioners, and he worries about the serious shortage of clergy in Sichuan,\nwhich has but seventy priests for 120 churches. He also worries about money,\nbecause his parishioners are too poor to give much support, and foreign\nassistance has diminished since his younger brother died in Singapore five\nyears ago.\nBut he doesn’t worry too much, because such concerns seem minor\ncompared to everything that he has seen in the past. He has seen the War of\nResistance Against the Japanese, the Civil War, and Liberation. He has seen,\npersonally, the campaign against Foreign Teaching and the campaign to\nDestroy Superstition. He has seen the old French-built church turned into a\nsock factory. He has seen ugly words draped over his shoulders. He has seen\nthe church reopen back in 1981, and on the first Sunday he saw fewer than\ntwenty nervous people come to Mass. Now the Fuling area has more than a\nthousand Catholics, even if rarely there are more than fifty at a given service,\nand for an old priest like Father Li there is a great deal of satisfaction in\nseeing that much. Others weren’t so fortunate.\nBut still it seems strange that in his office he can look up and see the\nphotograph of Mao Zedong, who made a three-decade hole in Father Li’s life\nas a priest. It is not uncommon for Sichuanese victims of the Cultural\nRevolution to have a poster of Deng Xiaoping on their walls, because he\nsuffered as they did, but very few of them display pictures of Mao. Perhaps\nfor Father Li there is a political reason—maybe he does it to appease cadres,\nthe way somebody is appeased by the Four Modernizations sign in the\ncourtyard. In China, many officials see religion as subversive, particularly the\nCatholic Church, and perhaps the photograph is intended to put their minds at\nrest.\nFather Li often looks at the picture. While talking about the trials of the\npast, he glances at it repeatedly, and every time there is the sudden flash in\nhis eyes, as if something about the photograph holds his memories together.\nAt the end of his story, he looks at it once more. Again he points a steady\nfinger at Mao.\n“All of that was his idea,” he says. He pauses, still staring at the picture,\nwhose smiling figures give no sense of what “all of that” entails: the broken\nchurch, the cruel and violent children with their red armbands, the lost years",
        "and the lost friends. Then the priest says, simply, “Because of that, we don’t\nrespect him.”",
        "CHAPTER EIGHT",
        "Chinese Life\nON SUNDAY MORNINGS in Fuling I went to eight-o’clock Mass. I had\ngone to Mass alone during the spring of my first year, but now in the fall I\nwent with Noreen Finnegan, who was one of the new Peace Corps volunteers\nsent to Fuling. There were two of them—Noreen and Sunni Fass. It felt\nstrange to have suddenly doubled the population of waiguoren, and neither\nAdam nor I knew exactly what to think about the change. We were\ncomfortable with our routines of the first year, and our relationship had\nalways been easy—we were very close, but at the same time we had always\nbeen able to spend time apart. There were sections of the city and the college\nthat each of us had carved out for himself, and we didn’t interfere with each\nother’s routines.\nIn a small place like Fuling it doesn’t take long to feel possessive about\nthe city. Neither Adam nor I had ever seen another waiguoren there, apart\nfrom friends who had come to visit us, and our contact with the Peace Corps\nwas minimal. Two administrators had made visits during our first month of\nservice, but after that we were left alone. Fuling was far from the Peace Corps\nheadquarters in Chengdu, and none of the administrators liked taking the\nYangtze boats, which were slow and dangerous. Back in the spring, two of\nthe Fuling boats had collided near Chongqing in a particularly bad accident,\nkilling more than a dozen people, and several times on the river I saw\nabandoned boats that were in various stages of sinking. I was always careful\nto pass these stories along to the Peace Corps, so they’d be less inclined to\nvisit. It was simplest if we were left alone, and for the most part we were.\nBut now there were four of us, and for a while I worried about the\nchange. In the end, though, it didn’t have much of an effect. Life was slightly\ndifferent in the college, but the city was big enough to swallow four\nwaiguoren without any trouble. And for the first semester Noreen and Sunni\nwere very similar to Adam and me at the beginning; they were shell-shocked",
        "by the pressures of downtown Fuling, and neither of them spent much time\naway from campus.\nNoreen’s parents had immigrated to New York City from Ireland, which\nwas one reason she went to Mass on Sundays. When she first mentioned that\nher father had been an Irish potato farmer, Mr. Wang, who was the waiban\nrepresentative, became very excited. “So your father was a peasant!” he said.\nNoreen didn’t know what to think about that. “Well,” she said, “he was a\nfarmer in Ireland.”\n“But you said he was poor, right?”\n“Well, yes.”\n“So he was a peasant!”\n“Uhm, I guess.”\n“My parents were also peasants! Most of your students in this college are\npeasants!”\nNoreen knew little about class background in China, and she asked me\nhow one should react when people said your father was a peasant. But in\nChinese there isn’t really a word for farmer—people who worked the land are\nnongmin, literally “agricultural people,” and in English it is usually translated\nas “peasant.” In some ways this is an inaccurate translation, calling to mind\nfeudal Europe, but also a term like “farmer” fails to convey the negative\nconnotations that are associated with working the land in China. Roughly 75\npercent of the population is involved in agriculture, and the divide between\nthese people and the urban Chinese is one of the most striking gaps in the\ncountry. City dwellers in a place like Fuling can recognize a peasant at a\nsingle glance, and often they are victims of prejudice and condescension.\nEven the world for soil—tu—can be applied to people as a derogatory\nadjective, meaning unrefined and uncouth.\nBut so many of our students were from rural families that these\nprejudices weren’t strong on campus. In a class of forty-five there were\nusually fewer than ten who had grown up in any sort of small city, and these\ncities tended to be even more remote than Fuling. Very few of the students\nhad much money, which meant that it was rare to see either the snobbishness\nof privilege or the sensitivity of coming from a lower-class background.\nWhen I asked my students what their parents did for a living, almost always\nthey responded, in English, “My mother and father are peasants.”\nAt the beginning these responses embarrassed me, because the students",
        "used this feudal word in such a matter-of-fact way. Once I asked a freshman\nabout his family, and he said, “My father is a peasant, and my mother is a\nsweeper.”\n“I’m sorry, I didn’t understand. What does your mother do?”\n“She is a sweeper.”\n“A sweeper?”\n“Yes. She sweeps the streets.”\nHe said it without any self-consciousness, the same way that all of them\ndescribed their backgrounds. I told Noreen that she should be proud to be the\ndaughter of an Irish peasant—of all the Fuling waiguoren, she had the most\nrevolutionary class origins.\nNoreen and I went to church on Sundays, which was one of my favorite\nroutines in Fuling, because I liked watching the priest and the old women\nwho went there every week. They were survivors—there was a quiet strength\nto the congregation, and they had none of the well-dressed smugness of\nAmerican churchgoers. All of them had paid for their faith, in ways that\nmoney could not measure, and Father Li had paid the most of all.\nWatching the priest also made me remember my mother’s father, who\nhad been a Benedictine monk. He had grown up in Arkansas, where his\nparish sometimes awarded promising students with scholarships to Italy, and\nin 1929 my grandfather was sent to San Anselmo Abbey in Rome. He was\neighteen years old, and his plan was to become a priest and perhaps a\nmissionary.\nI had read his diary from those years and it was full of homesickness, but\nit was also full of the beauty and wonder of Rome, the stunning churches and\nthe history that caught the young man’s eyes everywhere he turned in the\ncity. He was in the middle of that history, too; often his diary mentioned\nnationalistic rallies in the streets, and a few times he caught sight of\nMussolini at parades.\nIn the spring of 1931, a group of priests returned to the abbey from\nCatholic University in Beijing. On March 1 of 1931, my grandfather’s diary\nreads, in neat black script:\nA bunch of us Americans visit Fr. Sylvester Healy in his room this\nmorning, and have a long talk about China in general and the Catholic",
        "University of Peking in particular. Fr. Healy made his Solemn\nProfession this morning in the College Church. He seems very\noptimistic about the future of the Catholic University and to have given\nhimself wholeheartedly to the work.\nAfter that day, the diary changes. There is less of Rome and more of\nChina; the fascination grows quickly, until “China” is capitalized and\nunderlined, a sacred word:\nMarch, 18, 1931: Fr. Francis Clougherty, Chancellor of the Catholic\nUniversity of Peking, arrives here to-day on his way back to China. A\nbig strapping Irishman.\nMarch 22, 1931: Fr. Clougherty holds an informal “at home” this\nmorning and about 15 of us troop up to his room. Of course there are\nsmokes and a general spirit of congeniality. Fr. Clougherty is very\ninteresting to listen to. According to him the University is now on a\nperfectly solid foundation and he has received promises to come out to\nChina from a considerable [number] of very capable teachers, both\nBenedictine and otherwise.\nMarch 23, 1931: All small talk among Americans is about China\nnow.\nMarch 25, 1931: Talk to Raph and Donald about China upon my\nreturn. Fr. Clougherty had a big day to-day but comes down to Donald’s\nroom and gives Donald, Hugh, Edward and me an inspiring talk. We are\nso wrought up that when Clougherty leaves at 12 o’clock Donald, H.,",
        "and I stay up and talk it over till almost 3 A.M. I believe that this is the\nturning point in my life and I am going to sign up for China. God be\nwith us!\nMarch 26, 1931: CHINA! Get up rather late this morning after last\nnight. Spend most of the morning in Donald’s room discussing China.\nFr. Clougherty comes down and brings pictures of the statues about\nwhich he spoke last night. It seems there will be quite a little colony of\nAmericans emigrating from San Anselmo, Rome, to Catholic\nUniversity, Peking. Deo Volente, I am one of them.\nMarch 27, 1931: Everything is China at present. I breathe, eat and\nsleep China and I think that is about the case with all of our “China\ngroup.”\nAs my grandfather came closer to taking his vows of priesthood, his\nsuperior informed him that he would be sent back to Arkansas. My\ngrandfather responded with a long letter explaining that deep in his soul he\nhad a call from God to serve in China. But his superior countered by saying\nthat sometimes this is how God works—occasionally He gives a young man a\nfalse call, simply to test his loyalty to his earthly superior, and sometimes you\nfeel truly that you are meant to go to China when in fact you are intended to\ngo to Arkansas.\nAnd so passed the turning point of my grandfather’s life. He did not want\nto be a priest in Arkansas, and the Benedictines did not want him to be a\npriest in China; and thus he left the order and returned to America. He sold\ninsurance. He married. He had children, grandchildren. He retired, played\ngolf, traveled. On Sundays he always went to Mass. He never did go to\nChina. He didn’t talk much about his time as a monk, and I never knew about\nhis interest in China until I came across his diaries as a graduate student. But\nby then it had been seven years since he had died in 1987, when I was",
        "seventeen years old—nearly the same age as the young monk in Rome and,\nlike him, too young to have any sense of time, of what the future might hold\nand how the past might reappear.\nI CONTINUED WITH MY CHINESE TUTORIALS in Fuling,\nalternating between Teacher Kong and Teacher Liao. We always started\nclasses with small talk, and often Teacher Liao told me about what she had\nwatched on television the night before. Like most of my friends in Fuling, she\nwatched an enormous amount of television, and one day she came to class\nparticularly interested in what she had seen.\n“Last night there was a waiguoren on television,” she said, “He was\nspeaking Chinese.”\n“Was it Da Shan?”\n“No, it wasn’t Da Shan; his Chinese wasn’t nearly as good as Da Shan’s.\nHis Chinese wasn’t as good as yours.”\n“That can’t be true.”\n“Actually, his grammar was better than yours, but his pronunciation was\nworse. His tones were bad.”\n“I don’t believe it.”\n“I’m not kidding,” she said. “I think your Chinese is better than that of\nthe waiguoren who was on television. And if you improved your grammar, it\nwould be much better.”\n“Where was he from?”\n“Australia. He was very ugly—he had bad skin and very long hair. He\nwas extremely hard to look at.”\nFor a moment we sat there, silent in our shared distaste for the longhaired\nwaiguoren with bad tones on television. Then we started class, and Teacher\nLiao paid particularly close attention to my grammar.\nAfter that she kept me updated on the waiguoren who appeared on\ntelevision. For the most part it was a small and select group, with Da Shan as\nthe mainstay, and all of the regulars were very good at Chinese—it was clear\nthat I still had years to go before I could enter that league. But Teacher Liao\napparently felt that there was hope, and occasionally a waiguoren with tone\nproblems would appear and she would criticize him mercilessly. Always she",
        "was careful to point out any physical defects or shortcomings, especially if\nthe waiguoren was fat. Teacher Liao was an extremely slender woman and\nshe did not like fat waiguoren.\nThere was still a certain formality to our relationship, but it had become a\ncomfortable formality—the Chinese relationship between a teacher and a\nstudent. She took pride in my progress, and now that I was starting to read\nnewspapers she carefully reviewed the Chongqing Evening Times and clipped\narticles that we could use in class. She liked clipping stories about the\nJapanese atrocities of World War II, and she also liked stories about Hong\nKong’s improvements since its return to the Motherland (great things had\nhappened in those three months). Occasionally she could not help but select\narticles that criticized America’s imperialist tendencies. In late September,\nwhen France complained about American sanctions of Iran, our tutorials\nconsisted of a slew of stories condemning America’s role as “the policeman\nof the world.” But even in those classes there was no tension; our Opium\nWars were long finished, and we had learned how to deal with each other.\nBoth of us had changed, but probably I had changed the most: I was no\nlonger strictly a waiguoren, neither in her eyes nor in my own.\nI liked Teacher Liao because now I could see that she was a very\ntraditional Chinese woman—in my mind, she was the most Chinese person I\never came to know in Fuling. She refused to allow a waiguoren to\ncondescend to her, because she was a fiercely proud woman, but at the same\ntime she was capable of extending this pride to me after months of work.\nAlong with her pride, she had a strong sense of propriety and tradition. She\ndidn’t dress in revealing clothes like many other young women did, and she\ndidn’t Westernize her hair by dyeing. Unlike Teacher Kong, she refused to\nhave our classes in my apartment. Teacher Liao was a married woman and I\nwas a single man, and people might talk if she spent six hours a week in my\nhome. We always met in my office.\nI also liked studying with Teacher Liao because I could get some sense of\nthe prevailing Chinese attitude to nearly any issue by simply asking her,\nbecause she was so Chinese, and often I used our classes to untangle things\nthat I had seen or heard in my encounters with other people. For a while I was\nintrigued by the Chinese fascination with Hitler—if you ever talked with Old\nHundred Names about the Führer, they generally gave good reviews. The\nsummer before in Xi’an, I had known a German student who was disturbed",
        "by the way many Chinese became excited when they discovered her\nnationality.\n“Oh, you’re from Germany!” they would say. “Xitele—Hitler! Very\ngood!”\nOut of curiosity I often asked the Chinese about him, and many people\nsaid the same thing—that he had made some mistakes, but he had been a\ngreat leader who did some fine things for his country. It seemed natural\nenough that Chairman Mao had left the Chinese with a certain appetite for\ndictators, but I was still curious, and I asked Teacher Liao why the Chinese\nwere so positive about Hitler. As usual, she was extremely helpful. She said\nthat for years Charlie Chaplin’s The Great Dictator had been seen in theaters\nand on television; everybody in China had watched it.\n“Have you seen it?” I asked.\n“Certainly!”\n“How many times?”\nShe paused and counted in her head. “Four, I think,” she said. “Maybe\nmore.”\n“What’s it like?”\n“It’s very wonderful! I always liked the way Hitler talks in the movie,\nlike a crazy man. He’s like this”—and she imitated Charlie Chaplin imitating\nHitler; she raised her shoulders and shook her fist, chin in the air.\n“Wah wah wah wah wah!” she shouted, as if giving a speech in a foreign\nlanguage, and then she collapsed into giggles.\n“But doesn’t that movie make fun of Hitler?” I asked.\n“Of course!”\n“So why is it that so many Chinese people tell me that there are some\ngood things about him?”\n“Most of us have two contrary ideas—that Hitler was a great leader, and\nthat he was a crazy man who did terrible things. We have both of these ideas\nat once, you see. And I think people believe that he is an interesting\ncharacter, and that also makes them like him. He’s very interesting to watch.”\nPerhaps the strangest part of the Chinese fascination with Hitler was that\nsimultaneously they had a deep respect for the Jewish people. Jews were the\nnext best thing to the Chinese—they were an extremely intelligent race, as\none could tell from the examples of Einstein and Marx. In Xi’an, I had\nstudied with an Israeli student, and the teachers and workers had made an",
        "enormous fuss over him. Everybody was very impressed by his intelligence,\ndespite the fact that he was not particularly bright and a horrible student of\nChinese. But he was Jewish, and all Jews were intelligent; everybody knew\nthat and so they overlooked the reality of his particular case. It was the same\nas my blue eyes.\nIdeas of this sort were standard and completely predictable, and the\nlonger I lived in China the more I realized that in this sense the country\nwasn’t as complicated as outsiders often said. Foreigners always talked about\nhow difficult it was to understand China, and often this was true, but there\nwere also many ways in which the people’s ideas were remarkably uniform\nand predictable. There were buttons that you could push—Hitler, Jews, the\nJapanese, the Opium Wars, Tibetans, Taiwan—and 90 percent of the time\nyou could predict the precise reaction, including specific phrases that people\nwould use. It was natural enough, given China’s conditions: virtually\neverybody was the same race, the country had been isolated for centuries, and\nthe current education system was strictly standardized and politically\ncontrolled.\nAnd it was also natural that these conditions resulted in some particularly\nbizarre notions, like the admiration of Hitler or the fascination with Thai\ntransvestites. This was something else I had realized over the summer: if you\nasked random Chinese people about Thailand, virtually all of them would say\nthe exact same thing, that the Thais are famous for their renyao, or\ntransvestites.\nIt was interesting to figure out these common beliefs, and occasionally\nyou could work them to your advantage. During the summer, my sister\nAngela and Todd, her Stanford colleague, had been bored by eating meals\nwith their Chinese interpreter, so I gave them a list of subjects that would\nsurely make things more entertaining. Todd was Jewish, and I told him that\nthis was a trump card that should not be wasted. After I left, he broke the\nmonotony of a meal by announcing his ethnic background.\n“You are Jewish?” the interpreter said, eyes wide.\n“Yes.”\n“You must be very clever!”\nAfter that, he treated Todd with new respect. It had been the same way\nwith a teacher in the second Peace Corps group; everything changed once the\npeople discovered that she was Jewish. One of her Chinese friends",
        "apologized to her, because before the revelation the friend had not treated her\nwith the appropriate respect that should be accorded a Jew.\nOnce during the summer I had studied my Chinese textbook while riding\na train, which impressed the other passengers. As a waiguoren it was never\nhard to impress—even the most pathetic command of the Chinese language\nmade the people respect you. But on that train there was one woman who\nstudied me with particular interest.\n“You are a Zhongguotong,” she said. “A China hand. I can see that you\nstudy very diligently.”\n“That’s not true,” I said. “If I studied diligently my Chinese would be\nbetter.”\nShe peered at me, and it was clear that she was thinking hard about\nsomething. “Are you Jewish?” she finally asked.\n“No,” I said, and something in her expression made me want to\napologize. But I suppressed the urge, and we talked for a while longer. I\nsensed her disappointment as she returned to her berth, but there was nothing\nto do about that: I was just another waiguoren, and not a Jew at all.\nEVERYTHING IN FULING was new that second year. I had new students\n—all of last year’s seniors had graduated, and most of them were teaching in\nthe countryside. My own Chinese tutors were as good as new; they were real\npeople now, and we could talk comfortably about anything. The city didn’t\nseem as dirty and loud as last year, and the people were friendlier. When they\nspoke, it made sense. The only thing that hadn’t changed was my job; I still\ntaught literature, but now it was easier because I had last year’s notes. I spent\nmost of my spare time in the city, wandering around and talking to people.\nI had city routines for every day of the week, every time of the day.\nSometimes in the mornings I went down to South Mountain Gate and sat in\nthe park, watching the city come to life. Tuesday afternoons I talked to the\nphotographer and went to Wangzhou Park. Monday evenings I walked along\nthe busy streets of Mid-Mountain Road. On Sundays, I went to church, and\nafterward I sat and talked with Father Li, who served me bad coffee. I did not\nlike good coffee but I drank the priest’s coffee out of respect, just as he\nserved it to me out of respect for the waiguoren tendency to prefer coffee to",
        "tea.\nAfter talking with Father Li, I would wander through the old city and\nwatch the blacksmiths at work near the river. Then I would walk up to the\nteahouse in the middle of town, because on Sundays a group of middle-aged\nand older men brought their pet birds there, hanging the cages from the\nrafters. They were always happy to see me, especially Zhang Xiaolong, who\nwas the Luckiest Man in All of Fuling. Ten years ago he had been injured in\na motorcycle accident, shortening one leg, and now he walked with a limp. It\nwas a wonderful injury because it meant that he was officially classified as\ndisabled, and thus he could never be fired from his job at the Hailing factory.\nIt was a state-owned enterprise, and reforms were leading to layoffs, but none\nof this concerned Zhang Xiaolong, whose job was completely secure. It was\nmore luck than one could expect from a motorcycle accident, but Zhang\nXiaolong had beaten the odds again when his wife became pregnant and gave\nbirth—not to a daughter, or to a son, but to twin sons. To be slightly but\ncertifiably disabled, and to have twin sons—that was fantasy; it didn’t happen\nin real life; people wrote books about good fortune of that sort.\nEvery Sunday, Zhang Xiaolong limped proudly to the teahouse, carrying\nhis birdcage, and he sat beaming in the sunshine as he drank his tea. He was\nthe Happiest Man in All of Fuling, as well as the Luckiest, and I liked talking\nwith him—not because he was particularly interesting, but simply because he\nwas always pleasant. And he reminded me that my own life in Fuling was\nalso charmed. Almost everywhere I went, people knew who I was, and I\ncould follow my routines and be assured that the regulars would be happy to\nsee me. There were still plenty of young men who shouted a mocking “Hah-\nloooo!” when I walked down the street, but it was less of a problem than last\nyear, and in any case the harassment was drowned out by the kindness of\nmost people. It was the same paradox that I had realized during the summer\n—the Chinese could be hard on foreigners, but at the same time they could be\nincredibly patient, generous, and curious about where you had come from. I\nfelt I had spent my first year coping with the hard part of being a waiguoren,\nand now I enjoyed all the benefits.\nIn many ways the city had turned full circle for me, but of course I was\nthe one who had really changed. I was a new person, He Wei, or, as the\nSichuanese pronounced it, Ho Wei. That was the name I had been given\nduring Peace Corps training, and it was common in China: the given name,",
        "Wei, meant “great” and was as run-of-the-mill as John in America. The\nfamily name was also prevalent; there were plenty of Hos wherever I went in\nSichuan, and when I introduced myself they always said that we were\njiamenr, family. There was even another Ho Wei at the college, who taught\nin the physical education department.\nIt was different from living in most countries, where you could use your\nreal name or something similar to it, which was a clear link to who you had\noriginally been. My Chinese name had no connection to my American name,\nand the person who became Ho Wei had no real connection to my American\nself. There was an enormous freedom in that—at the age of twenty-eight, I\nsuddenly had a completely new identity.\nAnd you could tinker with that identity, starting with changing your name\nitself. Adam had done this at the end of our first year, because his original\nname, Mei Erkang, sounded too much like a foreigner’s name (it also\nsounded a lot like a popular Sichuanese brand of pig feed). Looking for\nsomething that was more authentically Chinese and less agricultural, Adam\nasked his students to propose new names, complete with explanations, and\nafter several rounds they came up with Mei Zhiyuan. The given name,\nZhiyuan, meant “Motivated by Lofty Goals,” and it was shared by Ma\nZhiyuan, a Yuan Dynasty poet who seven centuries ago had written a famous\nverse on homesickness. Virtually all educated Chinese recognized the\nallusion, and there were subsequent writers who had used the two characters\nin other poems. Suddenly, Adam went from pig feed to a noble-sounding\nclassical allusion—that was how easily a waiguoren could redefine himself in\nChina.\nI never changed my Chinese name, but I sensed the ease with which my\nChinese identity became distinct from my American self. Eventually, I came\nto think of myself as two people, Ho Wei and Peter Hessler. Ho Wei wasn’t\nreally a person until my second year in Fuling, but as time passed I realized\nthat he was becoming most of my identity: apart from my students,\ncolleagues, and the other foreigners, everybody knew me strictly as Ho Wei,\nand they knew me strictly in Chinese. Ho Wei was completely different from\nmy American self: he was friendlier, he was eager to talk with anybody, and\nhe took great pleasure in even the most inane conversations. In a simple way\nhe was funny; by saying a few words in the local dialect he could be\nendlessly entertaining to the people in Fuling. Also Ho Wei was stupid,",
        "which was what I liked the most about him. He spoke with an accent; he had\nlousy grammar; and he laughed at the simple mistakes that he made. People\nwere comfortable with somebody that stupid, and they found it easy to talk\nwith Ho Wei, even though they often had to say things twice or write new\nwords in his notebook. Ho Wei always carried his notebook in his pocket,\nusing it to study the new words, as well as to jot down notes from\nconversations. And when Ho Wei returned home he left the notebook on the\ndesk of Peter Hessler, who typed everything into his computer.\nI had two desks in my apartment. One was for studying Chinese, and the\nother was for writing; one desk was Ho Wei’s and the other belonged to Peter\nHessler. Sometimes this relationship unnerved me—it seemed wrong that\nbehind Ho Wei’s stupidity there was another person watching everything\nintently and taking notes. But I could think of no easy resolution to this\ndivide; I had my Chinese life and my American life, and even if they\noccupied similar territory, they were completely different. My apartment was\nbig and I kept the desks in separate rooms. Ho Wei and Peter Hessler never\nmet each other. The notebook was the only thing they truly shared.\nONE SUNDAY there was a funeral at the church. Noreen was sick that day\nand I sat alone, trying to follow the service in my missal. I always liked doing\nthat, because it was good Chinese practice and it reminded me of boyhood,\nwhen some of my earliest reading had been done during Mass.\nPeople milled around the courtyard after the service and I could see that it\nwas a special event. Father Li and I sat in the rectory, where he called for\ncoffee and cookies, and one of the old women who lived there brought them\non a tray. The coffee was even worse than usual. I thanked the woman and\ndrank as much as I could bear, eating cookies to dull the taste. Father Li and I\nasked about each other’s health, and then he mentioned that today’s service\nhad been a funeral.\n“Oh, I’m very sorry,” I said. “Who was it for?”\nHe said a woman’s name that I didn’t recognize. “How old was she?” I\nasked.\n“Eighty years old.”\n“She had a very long life.”"

      "text": "smoke and sunshine, the long streak of the Yangtze far below like a dragon\nbasking in the sudden roar of the valley.\nTHE PROCESSION CONTINUES UP THE MOUNTAIN, past green\nrows of broad beans, past waist-high wheat, past another steep ridge of short\nterraces and winding stone paths. The Yangtze is still visible to the south.\nFireworks echo in the distance. The family continues to the tomb of He\nZhonggui’s mother, who is buried farther up White Flat Mountain, in a plot a\nfew minutes away from the grave of her husband. She died thirty years after\nhim, and perhaps she had different ideas about the fengshui of the mountain.\nIn those days it was not uncommon for a couple to be buried separately.\nA tablet on the front of her tomb is engraved with five large characters:\nLi Chengyu, Mother of He. Below this title are two neat columns of names.\n“See, those are her descendants,” Dai Mei says, when she comes close to\npay her respects. “The women are on the left and the men on the right. And\nthere’s my name!”\nShe reaches out and touches the very last name on the list. Between Dai\nMei’s name and the name of her grandmother are more than a dozen others.\nSome of them have also come today to pay their respects, while others live\ntoo far away. Still others have died themselves. But everybody has been\naccounted for on the tablet. Dai Mei runs her finger over the engraved strokes\nof her name, and then she says, simply, “That’s me.”\nIN LATE AFTERNOON the family returns down the mountain. They have\neaten lunch on another cousin’s threshing platform, and now they take their\ntime going home, stopping occasionally to enjoy the scenery.\nBut He Zhonggui has no great love for the land. To most outsiders, the\nfields seem beautiful and romantic, but his parents lived here, and the\nmountain represents a hard life that he is happy and proud to have left behind.\nHe stops to rest halfway down the hillside, and staring out at the Yangtze he\nspeaks softly. “I grew up in the city,” he says. “Not here in the countryside.\nBut we were still poor; my father worked on the docks. At fifteen, I went to\nwork, too. I went all alone, and I worked in construction. I was just a\n\ncommon worker. I was the same age as her.”\nHe points at Dai Mei, and for a moment it seems that he will continue the\nstory, but he falls silent. He is not a great talker, and perhaps the tale has\nalready been told too many times.\nIn any case, its trajectory is clear. It can be seen in everything about him\n—his clothes, his confidence, his cellular phone, which has rung several\ntimes during today’s rituals. And the tale can also be seen in his home, a\nthree-story building that he has constructed in the heart of downtown Fuling.\nAll of the residents are his relatives—a daughter on this floor, a brother on\nthat landing, another brother in between. The apartments are ranged around\nan open-air courtyard, and the family members can easily call out to each\nother across floors. The apartments themselves are spacious and equipped\nwith top-of-the-line VCD players and karaoke machines. The ceilings are\ndecorated with faux-jeweled light fixtures, baroque patterns of plaster detail,\nand velvet tapestries of deep red and purple. From the roof, which has a green\nfish pond and an orange tree, one can look over Fuling’s tiled roofs to the\nYangtze River and the fields of White Flat Mountain.\nThere are very few private cars in Fuling, but He Zhonggui owns a brand-\nnew Red Flag sedan. He likes to point out that this is the same type of car that\ntransported Mao Zedong and Deng Xiaoping. He Zhonggui drives the car\nhimself, and later today he will drive it slowly and lovingly across town to\nthe East River district. He will drive past an apartment building that he\nrecently constructed, which he will point out with quiet pride. It is a massive\nuptown building of white tile and blue glass, the same kind of structure that is\nspringing up without distinction all over China. The car will slow as it passes\nthe building, and He Zhonggui will turn on the air-conditioning and ask, “Is it\ncool enough back there?”\nBut this is later. First he leads his clan back down the twisted stone path\nof White Flat Mountain, and at its foot he buys ice cream for everybody as\nthey wait for the ferry. They eat their ice cream on the pebbled shore of the\nYangtze. Above them, the mountain grows quiet; today’s fireworks are\nfinished. A breeze runs east through the valley. The pagoda is clear now in\nthe afternoon sun. The family finishes their ice cream, and, laughing, they\nwash their hands in the spring river.\n\nCHAPTER SIX\n\nStorm\nIN THE BEGINNING OF MAY there was a fire high in the mountains east\nof Fuling. For weeks it had been hot—hot and hazy, bright blurry days with\ntemperatures in the nineties. Ribbons of dust hung above the unpaved roads\nbehind campus, and the air was heavy with the heat. Everybody told me that\nthe spring rains had been too infrequent, and then the fire broke out on Two\nViews Mountain.\nThe mountain was the highest in the area; from its summit on a clear day\nyou could see both Fuling and Fengdu. There were forests up there, as well as\nsmall farms, and the fire burned out of control. Nobody knew how it had\nstarted. There was a hot dry wind coming off the Yangtze and it swept the\nflames across the mountain.\nOn the first night of the fire they took fifty student volunteers from the\ncollege to fight it, and the following morning another two hundred went.\nFrom my balcony I watched the second group gather in the front plaza. All of\nthem were boys, dressed in their military training uniforms, and they laughed\nand chattered excitedly as they waited to leave. Buses took the volunteers\naway and the campus was quiet again.\nThat day the sun was a hot dull disk in the sky and smoke filtered down\nfrom the mountains. I could smell it from my balcony. Many of the boys\nwere gone from my classes, and as the day passed I wondered how they were\ndoing up on Two Views Mountain. The girls were distracted and classes did\nnot go well.\nLater I was studying in my bedroom when I saw black clouds fill the\nwestern sky across the Wu River. A sudden wind began to blow papers off\nmy desk. I closed the window and took my laundry off the line, and then I\nwent through my apartment and fastened all the windows and doors. The\nstorm was close now, swelling dark behind the city, and I could hardly shut\nmy living-room windows against the force of the wind.\n\nI turned off the lights and put new batteries in my flashlight. I went out to\nmy glassed-in kitchen balcony just as the rain was starting. It fell in sharp\ndiagonal streaks, the wind growing even stronger, and the branches of the\ntrees bent angrily. Across the courtyard, the windows of the teaching building\nshattered as they blew shut, and the students shouted and screamed. They\nalways yelled in excitement whenever the big storms came, and sometimes\nthey forgot to fasten the windows. In spring the landings were often full of\nbroken glass from the storms.\nI heard more glass shattering down in the East River district, where\npeople scurried across the streets. On the western flank of Raise the Flag\nMountain there was a sudden blue flash, followed by an explosion, and then\nall the lights in Fuling went out.\nI watched the storm from my balcony. Clouds rolled in low over the\nmountains and the rain fell harder. The sky darkened and then suddenly\nflared white, as if somebody had scratched an enormous match against the\nquick-moving clouds. A tangle of lightning illuminated the peak of White\nFlat Mountain. For an instant the summit loomed high above the Yangtze,\nfrozen in the electric flash, but then the mountain disappeared as thunder rang\nthrough the angry sky. Soon the rain brought a mist over the rivers, until at\nlast the Yangtze was invisible and the Wu was only a flat streak of gray that\nblended smoothly into the unknown horizon.\nAfter half an hour the heavy storm was finished. The hills looked green\nagain; the dust and smoke had been rinsed from the air. It rained lightly\nthroughout the evening. The next day my students returned from the hills,\nand it turned out that the storm had put out the fire before they even made it\nto the mountain. But the trip had been a break from the routine, and they were\njust as excited to return as they had been to leave.\nTWO WEEKS LATER, the college had a three-day track meet in the new\nstadium that had been constructed in the shadow of Raise the Flag Mountain.\nMost Chinese schools had sports days in the spring, but ours was especially\nbig that year because of the new athletic complex, and because Hong Kong\nwould return in a month and a half.\nEverything that semester had to do with Hong Kong, just as everything in\n\nthe fall had been related to the Long March. There was a spring examination\ncontest about Hong Kong’s economics, and the Party Members wore special\nHong Kong pins that distinguished them from the other students. A\n“Welcome Back Hong Kong” sign decorated the entrance to the library, and\nevery day they changed the numbers to show how many days it was until the\ncolony returned to the Motherland. Sometimes I asked my students how\nmany days were left, and they always knew the exact number.\nThey spent weeks preparing for the track meet. The serious athletes\ntrained on the old athletic grounds beside the cafeteria, and everybody\npracticed for the parade that would precede the event. The boys worked on\ntheir goose-step military marches while the girls prepared elaborate flag\ndances, and during their Sunday-night political meetings they sang songs\nabout Hong Kong.\nThe opening ceremonies for the competition were held in a downpour.\nThe Hong Kong banners drooped sadly, and the brightly colored helium\nballoons refused to rise. But the celebration continued: the students, more\nthan a thousand of them, slogged grimly along the muddy track, and they\nwore tight faces as they did their dances in the pouring rain. Nearly all of the\nspectators left, and the cadres, who huddled under the overhang in the center\nof the stands, shivered as they reviewed the marching. Next week all of my\nclasses were full of coughs and sniffles.\nThe athletic competitions were postponed for two days, and then the\nweather improved and the meet went off without a hitch. Classes were\ncanceled, and the students were seated around the stadium according to\ndepartment. It was a serious competition. All of the girls’ events over four\nhundred meters in length ended in every single competitor collapsing at the\nfinish, and before their races the runners carefully recruited groups of friends\nto carry them away after it was over. In a way it was touching, like a soldier\nwriting a farewell note home before going into battle. A girl would give her\nfriends clear instructions, and then after the race she would collapse in their\narms and be carried out of the stadium gates, gasping and crying—exit stage\nright, a curious form of Sichuan opera. In the boys’ races it was less common,\nbut still about a quarter of the runners collapsed at the finish. Friends helped\nthe boys to the department aid tables, where they were given hot tea and\nMagnificent Sound cigarettes. After five minutes they were fine.\nI was scheduled to run the 1500 meters, the 5000 meters, and the 4×100-\n\nmeter relay. Faculty members had their own teams, and there were special\nraces for the retired teachers, who ran hard but never collapsed at the finish.\nBecause I had won the Fuling road race, I was entered in the student\ncompetition, and this spectacle—the foreign teacher going head to head\nagainst the students—was enough to work the crowd into a frenzy. They\npressed close along the finish area, until only the first two lanes were open,\nand my own students lined the backstretch. Huang Xiaoqiang, the owner of\nthe noodle restaurant where I usually ate lunch, came onto campus with his\nson to cheer for me.\nThe other runners were excited about competing against the waiguoren\nand they started too fast, the roar of the spectators in their ears. But from the\nbeginning I could tell that it was a different crowd from the January road\nrace; I heard voices calling my own name, both in English and Chinese, and\nthe English department students cheered as I steadily came from behind. I\nwon both races easily, and at the end of the 1500, when my students gathered\nto greet me at the finish, I felt more like a member of the department than a\nwaiguoren. It was the same way in the sprint relay, in which the distance was\ntoo short to give me an advantage and I ran the second leg without\ndistinction. Party Secretary Zhang anchored our faculty team, sprinting past\nthe Chinese department in the homestretch, and all of the English students\ncheered madly. Afterward the four of us posed for pictures with Raise the\nFlag Mountain in the background, and Party Secretary Zheng beamed and lit\na cigarette.\nBut during the 5000 meters the physical education students in the crowd\nstarted taunting me, shouting “Hahlllooo!” and “Yangguizi!” as I went by.\nYangguizi meant “foreign devil,” and they quieted down after some of my\nstudents scolded them, but I still heard their mocking cries, and in response I\nput my head down and ran hard for the last mile. It was unnecessary to do\nthat—I was already winning and I could feel a cold coming on. But I couldn’t\nhelp it; in a race that was the only way I would ever react to being taunted.\nI returned home to discover that I had a fever of 102 degrees. I realized\nhow foolish it had been to run the 5000 meters hard, and I saw that there was\nnothing much good about competing in events like that. I was too competitive\nand the locals were even worse; no matter how much things improved,\ninevitably it seemed to come down to me against everybody else. I decided\nthat it was more enjoyable to watch than to run, and after that I never raced\n\nagain.\nALL THROUGH THE COURSE OF THAT SEMESTER, my health\ngrew steadily worse. A few times I ran a fever, but mostly I was developing\nchronic sinus problems from the pollution, and I was always on antibiotics. It\nwas a strange time, because despite the health problems I had never been so\nsatisfied with life in Fuling. I was growing comfortable in the city, and I was\nstarting to make friends who spoke no English. My Chinese life was\ndeveloping and now I sensed that in the second year everything would be\nbetter.\nEven my classes with Teacher Liao had become markedly less tense. It\nwas as if our Opium Wars had allowed each of us to see the other clearly,\nalbeit in very brief flashes of contrary opinions, but the honesty of these\nviewpoints seemed to matter more than their substance. To some degree I\nknew where she stood—she had definite suspicions about waiguoren and\ntheir views on China, but she was open enough to make these suspicions\nclear. Increasingly I was inclined to see this as a welcome change from the\nEnglish department cadres, who smiled and treated me kindly but never\ndropped their guard. Teacher Liao at least respected me enough to provide\nglimpses of her viewpoints, and I sensed that she saw me in a similar light—a\nwaiguoren who didn’t always respect China but was at least willing to talk\nabout it. Our Opium Wars didn’t end in victory or loss; rather they quietly\nslipped away, and increasingly I enjoyed my classes.\nBut at the same time part of me was starting to wear thin, both physically\nand psychologically, and I knew that I needed time away from the pressures\nof living in a small place like Fuling. Adam was the same way, and as the\nsemester wound down there was something grim about the way we pushed\nonward. The term was scheduled to end just after Hong Kong returned to\nChina, on midnight of June 30, and after that we would be free to travel and\nstudy Chinese.\nI had first sensed the magnitude of Hong Kong’s return during the first\nterm, when I asked one of my third-year classes to write about the happiest\nday of their lives. Most of them responded as I had expected—they described\nthe day when they received their admission notice to the college. Don, who\n\nwas from a particularly poor part of the Fengdu countryside, wrote:\nOn that day, I got up very early. As soon as I had breakfast, I went to\nthe post office very quickly. I was very eager to see my score of entering\ncollege. The postman saw me coming toward him, so he shouted at me,\n“congratulations! This is your admission book.” I caught it from his\nhand. I lifted it above my head. I shouted without consciousness, “I have\nsucceeded at last!” At that time my happy tears came out of my eyes.\nThis is the result that I worked hard for fifteen years. During fifteen\nyears, I had studied very hard all the time. As a son of farmer, I wanted\nto go out of the countryside. It is the only way that I study harder than\nthe people in city or town. I didn’t disappoint the heavy expectation my\nparents and relatives had given. It was a turning point in my life. I can\nenter college to study a lot of knowledge. Thirty-first August 1994, I\nwill never forget you. You are my happiest day of my life. You are what\nI got with my sweat and blood.\nProbably three-quarters of the responses were of this sort, and they made\nfor pleasant reading: I saw the way that education was making a difference in\nmy students’ lives, and I was a small part of that process. But I was less\ninspired by the two students who wrote that the happiest day of their lives\nhadn’t happened yet, because it would be when Hong Kong returned to\nChina. One of them, whose English name was Peace, wrote:\nI’m sure that the day of July 1st, 1997 is my happiest day. On that day\nall of us Chinese will be cheerful and happy. Because the day of July 1st\n1997 is very especial day for us. Hong Kong will be restored to China\non that day, this shows accomplishment of the great cause of\nreunification in China. All of us know that the return of Hong Kong to\nthe motherland and China’s resumption of the exercise of sovereignity\nare a firm position and are not negotiable. Of course, I am happiest on\nthat day.\n\nAs the semester progressed, I was struck by how all of the political\nclasses and special events had made the return of Hong Kong a personal\nevent in the lives of my students. Ostensibly, of course, my subject matter\nhad nothing to do with Chinese politics, but it was inevitable that\noccasionally we drifted in that direction. For literature class we studied Kate\nChopin’s short story “Désirée’s Baby,” which led us into discussions about\nracism. We talked about the situation of blacks in America, and the issue of\ninterracial marriage, and the students asked me if there were any prejudices\nand stereotypes about Chinese people in America. I told them that current\nstereotypes often had to do with Chinese-Americans being overserious\nstudents, but I mentioned that in the nineteenth century many Westerners had\nbelieved that the Chinese were weak and incompetent.\n“Why was that?” one of the students asked.\n“Well, I guess it was because of the Opium Wars,” I said.\n“What do you mean?”\n“You know what happened in the Opium Wars,” I said. “At that time,\nChina wasn’t a very powerful nation, and it wasn’t difficult for the foreign\ncountries to defeat the Chinese armies. As a result, many of the foreigners\nbelieved that the Chinese people were weak. This idea changed later, of\ncourse, but at that time it was a common prejudice.”\nAfter I spoke there was silence and the students stared at their desks. That\nwas always what happened when you broke a taboo—there was an instant\nhush and you found yourself looking at forty-five circles of black hair as the\nstudents dropped their heads. They had done the same thing a week earlier,\nduring another discussion on racism, when I had said gently that I thought\nracism and xenophobia were problems everywhere, even in China.\n“There is no prejudice or racism in China,” Wendy said quickly, and I\ncould see that she was offended. She was one of the best students, as well as\none of the most patriotic.\n“I don’t think it’s that simple,” I said. “Why is it that people often shout\nat Mr. Meier and me when we go to Fuling City?”\n“They are being friendly,” Wendy said. “They just want to talk with you,\nbut they aren’t educated. They aren’t trying to be rude.”\n“Sometimes I’ve had children throw things at me,” I said. “That doesn’t\nseem very friendly.”\n“They are only children!”\n\n“But their parents just laughed and did nothing to stop them,” I said. “I’m\nnot saying that this is such a terrible thing, but I don’t think racism and bad\nbehavior toward foreigners are issues only in America. These problems could\nbe improved in China as well.”\nThe students dropped their heads and there was an uncomfortable silence.\nI realized that this was something we couldn’t talk about, and quickly I\nchanged the subject back to “Désirée’s Baby” and American racism. As a\nforeign teacher you learned to respond to the moments when the heads\nbowed, and mostly you learned that it was impossible to criticize China in\nany way. But I was still surprised to see that a week later my reference to the\nOpium Wars touched this same sensitivity.\nIt was especially odd considering that earlier in the semester, during our\nunit on “Rip Van Winkle,” they had shown no sensitivity whatsoever with\nregard to more recent periods in Chinese history. My assignment had been to\nperform skits about a Chinese Rip Van Winkle; each group had to write and\nperform a story from a different period. One of them was about a Chinese\nman who had gone to sleep in 1930 and woken up in 1950, and another\nspanned 1948 to 1968, and so on. Among the seven groups it was a capsule\nof twentieth-century Chinese history, and I was especially curious to see how\nthe group assigned to the Cultural Revolution would depict such a painful\nperiod.\nIn their skit, Rip was played by Aumur, an owlish boy with thick glasses\nand short black hair. He woke up confused, and soon the other students in the\ngroup, who were Red Guards, put a dunce cap on his head. They wrapped a\nCAPITALIST ROADER sign around his neck, and they tied his hands\nbehind his back. Roughly they forced him to his knees before the class. The\nRed Guards crowded around and then the struggle session began.\n“Why aren’t you a Red Guard?” one of the girls shouted at him.\n“What’s a Red Guard?” Aumur asked, confused.\n“You know what a Red Guard is! Why are you a Capitalist Roader?”\n“I don’t know what you are talking about. What’s a Capitalist Roader?\nMy name is Rip Van Winkle and I’m a loyal soldier in the Kuomintang\narmy.”\n“What did you say?”\n“I’m a loyal soldier in Chiang Kai-shek’s Kuomintang army. I’m just a\npoor man—”\n\n“A Counter-Revolutionary! He’s a Counter-Revolutionary!”\n“My name is Rip Van Winkle and I’m just a—”\n“Shut your mouth!” the girl screamed. “Now you will do the airplane!”\nTwo of them forced him to a standing position, pulling his arms back.\nThe other students beat spoons against metal bowls and shouted as they\nmarched back and forth. I watched from the back of the room, hoping\ndesperately that Dean Fu wouldn’t happen to walk past my class and poke his\nhead inside. I didn’t want to explain how “Rip Van Winkle” had taken us to\nthis point.\nThe strangest part was that the class loved it—by far it was the most\npopular of all the skits, and the audience cheered and laughed. This wasn’t at\nall what I had expected; I had thought that they would find a way to perform\na tactful skit that avoided the uglier aspects of that period, because I knew\nthat many of the students had parents who had suffered during the Cultural\nRevolution. But I never would have guessed it from watching them; nobody\nseemed upset, and the skit was as hilarious as A Midsummer Night’s Dream\nor any other comedy. It was similar to what the Chinese writer Lu Xun once\nremarked: “People with good memories are liable to be crushed by the weight\nof suffering. Only those with bad memories, the fittest to survive, can live\non.”\nBut my students’ memories weren’t uniformly bad. Although they joked\nabout the Cultural Revolution, they were incredibly sensitive about the\nOpium Wars. I knew that part of this sensitivity stemmed from my being a\nforeigner, but there was also a degree to which time had been turned around\nin their eyes, until events of the mid-1800s were more immediate and\nunresolved than the struggles of their parents’ generation. Chinese history\nbooks deemphasized the Cultural Revolution, and the issue of Mao Zedong’s\nexcesses was neatly handled by Deng Xiaoping’s judgment that the Chairman\nhad been 70 percent correct and 30 percent wrong. These were numbers that\neverybody seemed to know, and they had an almost talismanic ability to\nsimplify the past. During conversations, I sometimes nonchalantly mentioned\nthat Mao had been 67 percent correct, just to see what sort of reaction I\nwould get. Invariably the listener corrected me immediately. It made the\nCultural Revolution seem incredibly distant, a question of statistics: the\nlifetime batting average of Mao Zedong.\nIn contrast, nothing was simple about the Opium Wars, which seemed far\n\nheavier in the minds of my students. All year long they had been drilled on\nthe shamefulness of that history, and the return of Hong Kong was portrayed\nas a redemption that would have a real impact on their lives. In contrast, the\nstudent protests of 1989 were the most distant event of all, because as far as\nmy students were concerned the violence had never happened. They had been\nforced to undergo tedious military training as a direct result of the Tiananmen\nSquare crackdown, and yet some of these Sichuanese students were so\npatriotic that the return of Hong Kong would be the happiest day of their\nlives.\nThis was how the changeover looked on campus, but as I spent more time\nin the city I began to realize that everything was different for the average\nChinese worker, the sort of person who was described as laobaixing, “Old\nHundred Names.” Two or three times a week I stopped to chat with Ke\nXianlong, the forty-seven-year-old photographer in South Mountain Gate\nPark, and the more I got to know him the more I was surprised at his political\nviews. He was completely uneducated but he had interesting ideas;\nsometimes he talked about the need for more democracy and other political\nparties, and these were views I never heard on campus. Once I mentioned\nHong Kong, but he simply looked bored—it meant nothing to him.\n“If Hong Kong hadn’t been British for so many years,” he said, “it\nwouldn’t be as rich as it is today. If it had been Chinese, it would have had\nthe Great Leap Forward and the Cultural Revolution and all the other\nproblems, and those would have affected its development. We would have\nruined it like everything else.”\nI had never heard another person in Fuling say anything remotely like\nthat, and I told him that none of my students would agree with him.\n“Of course they have different ideas than me!” he said scornfully. “What\ndo they know? They’re too young! They don’t understand the real world;\nthey have no experience.”\n“But even the older teachers I know don’t have ideas like that.”\n“Of course! They have those political classes every week—they have to\nbelieve whatever the Communist Party says. We Old Hundred Names can\nhave our own ideas. I don’t have to study that stuff they study in the college.”\nI realized that as a thinking person his advantage lay precisely in his lack\nof formal education. Nobody told him what to think, and thus he was free to\nthink clearly.\n\nIt wasn’t the sort of revelation that inspires a teacher. The more I thought\nabout this, the more pessimistic I was about the education that my students\nwere receiving, and I began to feel increasingly ambivalent about teaching in\na place like that. In particular it bothered me that very little in my relationship\nwith the third-year students had changed since the fall. They had always been\nobedient and respectful, and they were incredibly enthusiastic about\nliterature. I had a great deal of faith in poetry, but nevertheless this faith had\nits limits; I believed that my job was not only to teach literature but also to\ndevelop a mutual respect and understanding that would allow us to exchange\nideas comfortably. I could see this happening with my Chinese tutors, despite\nthe enormous language and cultural barriers that had made things so difficult\nin the beginning, and this change was impressive because it had required a\ngreat deal of patience and effort from everybody involved. Mostly, it had\nrequired honesty, even if these moments of candor were occasionally\nunpleasant.\nBut my relationship with the students was still miles away from making\nthis transition. I could not mention Chinese xenophobia without their\nbecoming defensive, which told me that they identified more with the random\nChinese harasser on the street than they did with their waiguoren teacher.\nAnd there were still far too many moments when they dropped their heads in\ndiscomfort. This was something I came to loathe—the great head bow.\nWhenever that happened, I realized that I was not teaching forty-five\nindividual students with forty-five individual ideas. I was teaching a group,\nand these were moments when the group thought as one, and a group like that\nwas a mob, even if it was silent and passive. And always I was a waiguoren\nstanding alone at the front of the class.\nOther aspects of local life were starting to disturb me as well.\nIncreasingly I realized that I was being monitored in Fuling, although it was\nhard to tell what the point was. My letters home often showed signs of\ntampering, and occasionally I received something that had been opened. That\nspring my parents mailed me a copy of the New York Times travel section, in\nwhich I had written a story, but somewhere along the way my article had\nbeen carefully cut out. The strangest part was that the story had been about\nthe Mississippi River, and the only reference to China was the brief\nbiographical note at the end of the article, which said I lived in Fuling. Not\nlong after that, I sent my parents a long letter on computer disk, and by the\n\ntime they received it one section of the text had been erased and replaced\nwith a string of x’s. It was the only sensitive part of the letter, a description of\nan incident in which I had been harrassed by three drunk college students.\nThe rest of the story was intact, and out of curiosity my father took it to a\ncomputer expert at the University of Missouri, who said that the change could\nonly be the result of deliberate tampering. It was impossible for a disk error\nto produce an alteration like that.\nThese incidents were mildly disturbing, but mostly they were pathetic.\nWhat was the point of censoring an article about the Mississippi River? Who\ntook the time to read letters sent by foreign teachers in places like Fuling?\nCouldn’t this effort be put to some more useful application? I figured that the\npurpose must be intimidation—it was so clumsily done that they obviously\nwanted me to know it was happening. But in fact the tampering was far more\neffective in giving me examples of the kind of pointless paranoia that\ncomposed Communist China.\nCollege life also showed signs of well-organized monitoring. In January,\nanother Peace Corps volunteer near Chengdu had been taken to the local\npolice station after an altercation with a cab driver. The volunteer was clearly\nin the wrong, and eventually he was sent back to America; but during\nquestioning he learned that the police station had a record of everything\ncontroversial that he had ever said in class. All of it was there—his remarks\nabout Capitalism, and Mao Zedong, and everything else that was sensitive in\nany way. He had been particularly disrespectful of the Chinese political\nrestrictions, but I knew that all of us had stumbled across those lines in one\nway or another. And I knew that in the Fuling police station there was\nprobably a file with my remarks about Chinese xenophobia and the Opium\nWars, along with many other things that I had said in class.\nThere were students whose job was to report on the material I covered—\npolitical informers, more or less. Most likely they were the best students;\nprobably they were some of the ones I liked the most. But still they kept track\nof what I said, and it was hard not to think about that when I taught.\nONE OF THE MOST DIFFICULT THINGS to do in class was to have a\ndebate, because usually the students’ opinions were exactly the same. You\n\nhad to think of something foreign like Robin Hood, because in those cases\nthey couldn’t turn to what they had been told to think. The point was, more or\nless, to trick them into coming up with their own opinions. In the fall it had\nworked well with Robin Hood, and in the spring it was the same way with\nAdam’s planned-birth-policy debate.\nHe was doing a unit on population problems in his culture class, and we\nthought of the debate topic one night while we were sitting on my balcony\ndrinking local beer. There was no way you could ever debate openly about\nChina’s planned-birth policy—nobody would dare to oppose it—but you\ncould speak freely about America. So that was the topic: Should America\nalso have a law that limits most couples to one child?\nAdam did it with four classes, and it always divided them evenly. There\nwas a pattern to these divisions—the Party Members and the other students in\npositions of authority were always in favor of instituting the policy, while the\nopposing side included more of a fringe element. They wouldn’t have been\nconsidered a fringe element in an American class, of course, but in Fuling\nthey stood out—some of the quieter students, the ones who seemed slightly\nremoved and had nothing to do with the political organization of the class.\nIn every case they ended up debating about China without realizing it,\nwhich of course was exactly what Adam had wanted. During the last debate,\nas the arguments grew heated, a student named Rebecca stood up.\nHe was one of the third-year students who had chosen his English name\npoorly. He had bristly crew-cut hair and tired eyes, and it was clear that he\nwas intelligent, but he was hopelessly lazy and often failed examinations. I\nnever saw him associating with other students. In the debate he was opposed\nto America’s adopting the one-child policy, and he quickly made his point.\n“In America,” he said, speaking clearly, “the people are used to having\nmore freedom than we have in China. They are very concerned with human\nrights. Americans would never support the one-child policy, because they\nwould see this as going against their freedom.”\nHe sat down. An angry murmur ran through the class; for an instant it felt\nlike one of those times when they bowed their heads awkwardly. But then\nsomebody rebutted Rebecca and the moment passed, and the debate\nconcluded without any more comments of the sort.\nThe next day I finished literature class and Rebecca followed me into the\nhall. He asked if he could borrow a magazine, and I told him to come with\n\nme to my office, where we had stacks of old Newsweeks that the Peace Corps\nhad sent us.\nWe were walking up the stairs when Rebecca spoke again. “I think you\nmust notice that in China there is not as much freedom as in America,” he\nsaid. There were students all around us and many of them could speak\nEnglish. Adam had told me about yesterday’s debate, and I knew that must be\nwhat was on the young man’s mind.\n“Let’s go into my office,” I said. “I have lots of magazines there.”\nI left the door partly open. In the hallway it was too loud for people to\nhear us, and I assumed that Rebecca must already have a reputation; a closed\ndoor would only seem suspicious. But he didn’t seem worried about that—he\nsat down and looked me straight in the eye.\n“I often think that our China has many problems,” he said. “There is not\nenough freedom in China. I think in America you have more freedom.”\nIt was the first time I had heard a student speak this way, and I wasn’t\nsure how to respond. “I guess I would agree with you,” I said slowly.\nHis English was not very good and he had to think for the words. After a\npause he said, “I very much admire your American freedom.”\n“But some people think Americans have too much freedom,” I said.\n“That is one of the reasons why there is so much crime in America. People\nhave the freedom to own guns, and they can have any strange ideas they\nwant.”\n“I think that is not so important,” he said. “The life for most people in\nAmerica is very good, and the economy is very good, because there is so\nmuch freedom.”\n“I think that most of your classmates would not agree with you.”\n“No!” he nearly shouted. “They are all different. But they say that I am\nnot the same—sometimes they say that I am a ‘New Man.’ They don’t\nunderstand why I think this way.”\n“Well,” I said. “I guess I agree with your ideas. But I think you probably\nshould be careful.”\n“Sometimes I have fear,” he said. “Often I am afraid I can’t say what I\nthink.” The crowds in the hall were diminishing, and it was growing quieter,\nand I was thinking: Why are you still talking so loudly? But it was clear that\nhe had steeled himself for a long time to have this conversation, and he\nignored everything else as he stared at me and spoke evenly.\n\n“I don’t like this college,” he said. “I don’t like the rules, and I don’t\nagree with the ideas of the other students. And I don’t like the rules in\nChina.”\n“Probably things will be different in the future,” I said. “And already I\nthink they are a little different in places like Beijing and Shanghai.”\n“Everything changes too slowly in China,” he said. “I wish I could live in\na place like America where you have freedom.”\nI knew that this was unlikely but I didn’t say it. “Many people think\nChina is changing quickly,” I said. “You might find that it’s very different in\na few years. I read something about it a week ago.” I picked out a magazine\nthat had an article suggesting the government might reevaluate the\nTiananmen protests in the near future. It wasn’t much, but I had nothing else\nto offer Rebecca.\n“You might think this is interesting,” I said, handing him the magazine.\nHe took it and thanked me, and then he stared me in the eye again.\n“Do you like living in China?” he asked.\n“Yes,” I said. “But probably I don’t have the same problems that you\nhave. Sometimes I don’t like the political system, but it doesn’t affect me\nvery much. There are many other things I like.”\n“If I were you,” he said, “I would not like it here at all. I would stay in\nAmerica.”\nThat was all he had to say. He stood up, nodded goodbye, and left. On the\nway out he closed the door to my office.\nI sat there alone for a while, thinking about what he had said. He was the\nonly student who was anything like a dissident, and I remembered how I had\nimagined those figures before coming to Fuling. I had always assumed that\nthey were noble characters—charismatic, intelligent, farsighted, brave.\nPerhaps that was the way it had been in 1989, and perhaps it was still like that\nin the bigger cities; but here in Fuling things were very different. My best\nstudents—Soddy, Linda, Armstrong, Aumur; the ones who were charismatic,\nintelligent, farsighted, and brave—those were the ones who had been\nrecruited long ago as Party Members. If you had any talent you played by the\nrules; being a Party Member was good for your career, and in any case all of\nthe students seemed to think that it was good to be patriotic in the narrow\nway that they were told to be. The image I had once had of the Chinese\ndissident had no reality in Fuling.\n\nAll I had was Rebecca—he was the only one, and he was a loser. He was\na bad student, and he was socially awkward. He had no friends. He had a\ngirl’s name. Some of these characteristics had conspired to set him apart, and\nin his bitterness his ideas had undoubtedly swung even further from the Party\nline. If there were big changes in China’s future, it was hard to imagine them\ncoming from people like Rebecca, or, for that matter, from any of my other\nstudents. I realized again that any major developments would happen first in\nBeijing or Shanghai, and then at some point they would reverberate down to\nplaces like Fuling, just as they always had.\nNever again did Rebecca speak openly about the subject, but a couple of\ntimes I gave him magazines and he always thanked me. On the final exam I\ngraded him higher than I should have. Partly I admired his bravery, but\nmostly I just felt sorry for him.\nIN THE MIDDLE OF JUNE, the sinus infection moved into my right ear\nand broke the eardrum. It happened quickly—one afternoon I began to feel\npressure building in my ear, and by dinner it was painful and soon it was\nunbearable. The entire right side of my head throbbed with the pain, but there\nwas nothing to do except wait for the pressure to break the eardrum.\nIt was impossible to sleep, and the pain was too distracting for reading.\nPainkillers did nothing; finally all I could do was sit on my couch and watch\ntelevision. There was a music program with elaborate floor shows and I\nwatched that for a while, and then there was a show where small children\nwearing lots of makeup danced and did tumbling routines. There were always\nprograms like that on television—the Chinese love children intensely, and at\nalmost any hour of the day you could find a channel where a pack of them\nwere grinning and bouncing across a stage.\nWhen it got late there was only one station left, and in preparation for the\nreturn of Hong Kong they showed a movie about the Opium Wars. The pain\nin my ear was growing even more intense, and in my bitterness I consciously\nmade things worse by watching the movie closely and scribbling quotes onto\na pad of paper. The movie had English subtitles, which made it easier to take\nnotes from the dialogue: “These foreigners are really avaricious” “These\ntreaties are not only humiliating but unequal” “But the foreigners have evil\n\ndesigns” “Foreigners invade us only for gains” “Foreigners have insatiable\nlusts” “Frankly, we can bluff to foreigners” “Why? Why are they so\narrogant?”\nThe foreigners were British and at the end of the film they looted the\nSummer Palace. There was an auction and an ugly red-bearded Brit held up a\nscroll and said, “This is the oldest Chinese painting.” He asked for one\npound, but nobody responded. After the auction they burned down the palace.\nThe movie finished just after one o’clock in the morning and there was\nnothing else on television. I went outside and walked around campus for a\nwhile. The walking was a better distraction than watching a movie about the\nOpium Wars. The temperature was perfect, and everything was quiet, and\nstars flickered above the dark profile of White Flat Mountain. I knew that this\nwas not a high point of my experience in China, but it was a pleasant evening\nand that was worth something.\nFinally after another hour I was able to fall asleep. In the morning I\nawoke with my eardrum broken and my pillow covered with blood. But my\nhead didn’t hurt anymore, and I was able to take the long trip back to the\nPeace Corps headquarters in Chengdu—three hours by fast boat, four hours\nby bus. I visited the staff medical officer, who cleaned out my ear, and then I\nrested for five days, sitting in the teahouse at Chengdu’s People’s Park. When\nmy health improved, I went back to Fuling for the end of the term. The main\nconsequence was that for a month I couldn’t hear anything out of my right\near, except for a constant ringing sound. For a while the ringing was\nannoying, but soon I realized that it was better than listening to all the\nhonking. If you have to be half-deaf somewhere, you might as well be half-\ndeaf in Fuling.\nON JUNE 30, all classes were canceled for Hong Kong’s return. The\ncountdown sign was moved to a prominent spot along the college road, and\nred banners were hung from the dormitories. Colored lights and lanterns\ndecorated the hallways of the teaching building.\nMy classes were finished. Adam had left early; I would go in two days,\nafter grading my final exams.\nAt four o’clock, the students filed into their classrooms to watch\n\ntelevision. There were special programs until two o’clock the next morning,\nand the students were scheduled to watch ten consecutive hours of television.\nThey were excited and the teaching building was full of laughter.\nAt nine o’clock, fireworks exploded above the city and the students ran\nshouting onto the breezeway to watch. The Wu River pulsed with streaks of\nred and yellow, the sound booming across the valley. Everything in Fuling\nwas illuminated—the shops, the apartment windows, the long riverside road\n—and it seemed that the city was burning on the hills beside the rivers.\nThere were groups of children wandering around campus, the way they\nalways did on holidays, and some boys came up to see me in my office. I was\ngrading papers and they were led by Wang Xuesong, the eight-year-old who\nlived in the apartment across from mine. One of my more memorable\nconversations in Fuling was on another occasion when I asked Wang\nXuesong who China’s enemies were.\n“England,” he responded quickly.\n“Why?”\n“Because of the Opium Wars. They stole Hong Kong from our China.”\nI asked him if there were any enemies besides England, and again he\nanswered immediately.\n“Japan. Because of the Nanjing Massacre.”\n“Are there any others?”\n“Portugal.”\nI asked him why, and this time he had to think for a moment.\n“Because they took Guangzhou.”\nI let the mistake slide, assuming that he meant Macau. I asked him one\nmore question.\n“Who are China’s friends?”\nHe furrowed his brow and cocked his head to one side. “I don’t know,”\nhe said at last, shrugging.\nOn the night of Hong Kong’s return, Wang Xuesong and the other boys\nbounced on the furniture in my office, chattering excitedly. I gave them some\nforeign stamps I had lying around, and we talked about Hong Kong. I told\nthem I had lived in England for two years, which seemed to impress them—\nsomehow I had survived.\nAt half past eleven, a few of my first-year students stopped by my office\nto chat. They had become my favorites—at the beginning of the year they\n\nwere painfully shy, but they were enthusiastic and the classes were always\nenjoyable. I didn’t feel quite as much distance as I did with the third-year\nstudents, probably because the first-years were at a much lower level and my\nexpectations weren’t so high. When students studied Shakespeare, and\nstudied it well, it was difficult to understand why they couldn’t seem to\novercome the simple fact that their teacher was a foreigner.\nI had named the first-year students, which made them especially\nappealing. Some of them had been named after friends and family; often I put\nrelatives together when I assigned group work, so that my sister Angela could\nwork with my grandmother Doria, while my other sister Amy could be with\nConnor and Heidi, who were her children. The rest had names I simply liked:\nPuck, Anfernee, Miranda, Latoya, Ariel, Mike D, Ophelia, MCA. In that\nsense they were a very diverse group—much different from your standard\nclass in Fuling, in which so many of them had similar backgrounds and\nsimilar ideas. It seemed inevitable that students named Latoya and Ophelia\nwould have vastly different opinions about virtually everything; or at least\nthat was my fantasy, because diversity was something about America that I\nmissed. In particular, it was strange to live in a place where everybody was\nthe same race. For a year I hadn’t seen a black person. But in my first-year\nclass I had Latoya and Anfernee, who were better than nothing. And mostly I\nliked calling role at the start of class, saying names that were both exotic and\nfamiliar.\nTonight they were exhausted—they were like children who had been\ngiven permission to stay up all night, and in their excitement they had worn\nthemselves out by dinnertime. Ariel’s eyes were heavy with fatigue, and she\ntold me that she had tried to go back to the dormitory but the doors were\nlocked. Nobody was allowed to go to sleep until Hong Kong returned.\nTen minutes before midnight, I stepped into one of the TV rooms. All of\nthe lights were off and almost one hundred students were watching the tiny\nscreen. I looked for Rebecca and saw him sitting alone in a corner. The light\nof the television flickered blue off his glasses.\nFor days there had been torrential rains in Hong Kong. The ceremony\ncontinued, as steady as the clock that counted down in the corner of our\ntelevision screen, and the students cheered when President Jiang Zemin\nappeared. They applauded when they first caught sight of the Chinese flag.\nThey laughed at Prince Charles, and at the kilted Scottish flag-bearers who\n\nmarched across the podium. At the stroke of midnight the students screamed\nwhen the red flag rose and the Chinese national anthem began to play, and\nthe teaching building rang with the roar of the celebration.\nAfter midnight there were speeches, with Jiang Zemin promising that\nthere would be no changes in the economy and the human rights of the\nSpecial Autonomous Region. In Hong Kong it was still raining hard. I\nlistened for a few minutes and then left. On the way back to my apartment, I\ncut through the croquet court, where a few student couples were celebrating\nin their own way. They were making out in the shadows, taking advantage of\nthe night.\n\nPART II\n\nCHAPTER SEVEN\n\nSummer\nYAN’AN LOOKED AS IF A HARD RAIN would wash it away. A fine\nyellow dust covered the small city, and the crumbling hills above town were\npockmarked by the oval mouths of caves. People still lived in caves in the\nsuburbs of Yan’an, and many of the troglodytes were making a good show of\nit. There were caves with televisions, refrigerators, karaoke machines. North\nof Yan’an were villages whose school buildings and government offices had\nbeen carved into the dry loess hillsides. It was, in a land of blazing summers\nand cold winters, a sensible way to live.\nThe countryside in this part of northern China was forbidding and\ndesolate, but it was also eerily beautiful. And it was exactly what I needed\nafter a year in Sichuan; nothing could be more different from Fuling’s green\nrice terraces and misty rivers. The air in Yan’an was dry and there was a hard\nblue sky above the dusty hills.\nI was free that summer. The Peace Corps was going to fund my Chinese\nstudy for a month in Xi’an, but that wouldn’t start for two weeks and now I\nwas wandering into northern Shaanxi province. In some ways this region was\nthe heart of modern China, at least politically, because the Long March had\nended here in 1935. Ever since my arrival in Fuling, I had heard about the\nLong March and the Yan’an years, and I knew that northern Shaanxi\nprovince had been crucial to the Communist resistance against both the\nJapanese and the Kuomintang. And from history I also knew that the fragility\nof the landscape was an illusion; these hills had seen far worse than hard\nrains, but they were still here.\nA sign near the entrance to the Yan’an Revolution Museum said:\n“Celebrate Hong Kong’s Return, Wish Prosperity to the Motherland.” I paid\nten yuan and saw the museum’s exhibits. Mao Zedong’s horse was stuffed\nand on display, along with Mao’s machete and saddle. There was a war poem\nwritten in Mao’s distinctive flowing calligraphy. There were maps of major\n\nbattles, and photographs of the revolutionaries who had lived in Yan’an.\nThere weren’t many tourists. The glass-eyed horse’s name was Xiao Qing\nand it stood slightly off-kilter.\nLooking at the horse’s name I thought about Jiang Qing, the woman who\nmarried Mao in Yan’an, and I realized that I hadn’t seen any photographs of\nher. I walked back to the entrance, where the ticket-taker was knitting a\nsweater.\n“Didn’t Chairman Mao meet Jiang Qing here?” I asked.\n“Yes,” the worker said.\n“Do you have any pictures of her?”\n“No photos of the Gang of Four,” she said curtly, and then she went back\nto her knitting.\nIt was the same at Zaoyuan Park, where they had the cave homes of Mao\nand the other Red Army leaders. Liu Shaoqi’s cave had photos of him and his\nwife, Wang Guangmei; and Zhu De was pictured with his wife; but in Mao’s\ncave all traces of Jiang Qing were gone. She was a complication of history,\nand so her memory had been removed, leaving the cave with only its simple\nfurnishings: a bed, a bathtub, a bookshelf, a stone floor. Out in front, tourists\ncould dress up in the gray uniforms of the wartime Communists and have\ntheir photos taken. Teenage girls giggled as they mounted horses and\nbrandished pistols.\nI met a Xi’an railway mechanic in his forties, who said that he had come\nto teach his daughter about the Revolution. She was eight years old, with\npigtails and plastic Hong Kong Returns slippers. “The younger people in\nChina don’t know about the Revolution,” her father said. “Our generation\ndoes, so I’ve taken her here to study our Chinese history.”\nHe asked me what Americans thought about the Revolution, and I said\nthat most people didn’t understand it, which was the safest response. It\nalways made the Chinese happy when waiguoren said they didn’t understand\nChina. The mechanic and I talked for a while and then, as a polite way to\nshow that the conversation was ending, he said solemnly, “Our two countries\nhave taken different roads. But now we are friends.”\n“Yes,” I said. “We can forget about the problems of the past.” Many of\nmy random discussions in small places like Fuling and Yan’an ended like\nthat; the people seemed to feel a need to summarize the relations between\nChina and America, as if this had great bearing on the conversation at hand.\n\nOften it was the first time they had spoken with an American, which made\nour interaction seem like a momentous occasion. I liked that aspect of\nspending time in remote parts of China—every casual conversation was a\nmajor diplomatic event.\nI was in the mood to talk, and so I sat on a bench near the park entrance.\nWithin minutes an old man caught sight of me and hurried over. He told me\nthat he was a veteran of Yan’an’s Red Army, and he smiled when I said I was\nAmerican.\n“Thank you for helping us in the War of Resistance Against the\nJapanese,” he said. It wasn’t the first time I had been thanked for my\ncountry’s role in World War II. Chongqing cab drivers were particularly fond\nof expressing their gratitude, and I gave the old man the same response I\nalways gave the cabbies.\n“Mei guanxi,” I said. “No problem.”\nBy now a small crowd had gathered, curious to see the waiguoren. I\nbegan to talk with a student from Xi’an’s Communications University, who\nexplained that she had come because she was interested in the early years of\nChinese Communism. I asked her what would have happened if the\nrevolutionaries had failed.\n“Today there would be no Communist Party,” she said.\n“What if there were no Communist Party?”\n“China would be different?”\n“How?”\n“It would be like Taiwan,” she said. “Like America.”\n“What are those places like?”\n“The economy is developed, but—” and now she shifted from Chinese\ninto faltering English, because it was a phrase she remembered from her\nstudies—“but the rich get richer and the poor get poorer.”\n“What about the new economic policies—do you agree with Reform and\nOpening?”\n“Of course. All of us agree with that.”\n“But what about the gap between the rich and the poor? Doesn’t it get\nbigger?”\n“Some people will get rich,” she said, “like scientists and businessmen.\nBut this is necessary to develop the economy, and although others will\nimprove more slowly, they will improve.”\n\nWe talked for a few minutes longer. She asked if it was true that most\nAmericans didn’t understand China, and I agreed. I said nothing about the\nchallenge of understanding a country in which one heard theories of trickle-\ndown Capitalist economics in front of the enshrined cave homes of Marxist\nrevolutionaries. On my way out of the museum, I passed rows of souvenir\nstands, where they sold Mao pendants, Communist Party history books, fake\njade, cloth hangings, necklaces, statues, bracelets, stamps, cymbals, drums,\ngourmet rice. A commemorative Hong Kong Returns coin set was 320 yuan.\nThe hawkers shouted out to me as I left.\nTHAT EVENING policemen burst into my hotel room after midnight. It\nwas a cheap hotel near the train station, and I was fast asleep when the cops\ncame in.\nThere was no warning. I had locked the door but the policemen got a key\nfrom one of the workers, and they entered and turned on the light. By the\ntime I sat up, five officers were crowding around my bed, and I was terrified.\n“What’s the problem? What’s the problem?” I asked the question again\nand again, but they simply stared at me. “What’s the problem? What’s the\nproblem?” They listened and stared, and finally one of them spoke.\n“We want to see your passport,” he said.\nTrembling, I took out my money belt and gave him the passport. He\nopened it and looked at the photograph on the first page. Then slowly he\ngazed at the second page. There was nothing on that page except the colorful\ndesigns of the passport paper, and the other policemen crowded around to\nlook. The cop turned to the third page, also emptily full of color, and they\nstared at that as well.\nMy head was starting to clear and now I saw how young-looking they\nwere—little more than scrawny boys in baggy uniforms. They gazed at me\nshyly. I showed them the passport page with the Chinese visa and they liked\nthat, because they could read it. They flipped through the rest of the pages\nand then handed it back, smiling.\n“Is everything okay?” I asked.\n“Yes,” said one of them. But still they stood there staring at me in bed.\nThere was a long silence.\n\n“Well,” I said, “I’m tired. I think I will go to sleep now. Thank you very\nmuch.”\n“Thank you,” all of them said at once. They took a long last look at me\nbefore they walked out. I locked the door behind them and went back to\nsleep.\nTHERE WAS NO GOOD REASON TO GO to Yulin and it took ten hours\nto get there. None of the guidebooks said much about it, except that\nwaiguoren were restricted to staying in two expensive hotels. Yulin was a\nsmall town at the very northern tip of Shaanxi province, right near the border\nof Inner Mongolia, which was why I decided to go.\nNorth of Yan’an the countryside grew even more desolate, rising through\nnarrow canyons filled with cave dwellings. The river alongside the road died\nto a trickle, and in the burning heat all life was centered around that frail\nstream of water: peasants toting buckets, women washing clothes, boys\nswimming naked in shallow green pools. There were crop terraces high\nabove the river, decorated with dusty signs: Control the Population, Improve\nthe Population Quality. Having people here at all said a great deal about\nChina, and it said far more that even in this godforsaken place their\npopulation was controlled.\nAfter five hours I had seen enough. It was a brutally hot, dusty day, and\nthe road was under construction, and the broken-down bus was crowded. But\nthere was nothing to do except stick it out. Virtually every bus trip I took in\nChina seemed to reach that point—all of them were exactly twice as long as I\nwas willing to bear. And I knew that I would have to come back the same\nway, and that in Yulin I would undoubtedly pay a ridiculous price to stay in a\nthree-star waiguoren hotel, and I wished I hadn’t come.\nI arrived just after sunset and saw a cheap hotel next to the bus station.\nMy guidebook said that it was restricted to Chinese, but I figured there was\nnothing to lose by trying. The worker stared at me in surprise when I walked\nin. Frantically she waved and gestured me back toward the door, her eyes\nwide and silent as if she had been struck dumb.\n“I can speak Chinese,” I said, and the shock of hearing this made her eyes\nwiden even further. Finally she recovered enough to ask what I wanted.\n\n“I want to stay at this hotel.”\n“Waiguoren can’t stay here,” she said. “You have to go to a different\nhotel.” But she was still too shocked to be rude, the way most workers were\nwhen they were set against giving you something. This gave me an idea.\n“They’ve changed that rule,” I said. “Waiguoren can stay in the same\nplaces as Chinese now.”\nHer eyes narrowed but she was still listening. I took some of my Chinese\ntextbook’s vocabulary and ran with it. “The National People’s Congress\nchanged the law,” I said. “In Beijing they just changed it. Haven’t you heard?\nAt least it’s changed if you’re a teacher. Foreign teachers can stay in Chinese\nhotels, because we live in China and our salaries are the same as Chinese. See\n—here’s my danwei card.”\nI gave her my red work unit card, my light green foreign resident card,\nmy dark green foreign expert card, and my blue passport. The cards made a\ncolorful pile and the worker leafed through them slowly, awed and\noverwhelmed. The Chinese have a weakness for official documents, and they\noften liked staring at the black-and-white foreign devil pictures on my\nidentification cards. She gazed at them carefully, one by one, and then she\ngave me a registration slip for a two-dollar room. For the rest of the summer,\nI always referred to the National People’s Congress when all else failed, and\nthis turned out to be a remarkably effective tactic. Finally I saw the point of\nall the political jargon that I had memorized in class.\nThe next morning I caught a taxi north of Yulin, where the Great Wall\nran through the desert. Tourists rarely came to see the wall here, because it\nwas unrestored and the northern Shaanxi roads were so bad. There was no\nmention of the wall in my guidebook, but I had a Chinese map of the\nprovince which marked the ruins clearly.\nThe cabbie took me to a big Ming Dynasty fort that stood five miles\noutside of town, where Yulin’s irrigated fields ended and the desert began.\nFrom the fort’s highest tower the view stretched northward for miles.\nOccasionally the barrenness was punctuated by a slice of green where water\nhad found its way—a stand of trees, a lonely field—but mostly it was just\nsand and low brown hills and a vast thoughtless sky. At nine in the morning\nthe sun was already hot. I looked out at the empty landscape, at the hard low\nline of the horizon, and I realized why they had built the wall here. Even if\nthere had been no Mongol threat, the terror of the land’s monotony would be\n\nenough to make you build something.\nThe wall ran east and west from the fort. Westward it continued to its\nfinal stopping point at Jiayu Pass, in the mountains of northern Gansu\nprovince. Eastward the ruins ran to Zhonghai Pass, at the shore of the Yellow\nSea. All told the distance between these two endpoints was probably more\nthan fifteen hundred miles, and Yulin was somewhere roughly in the middle;\nbut the wall had never been fully surveyed and nobody knew the exact\nlength. I stood there at the desert fort, looking out at the heat waves\nshimmering above the sandy hills, and I decided to go toward the ocean. I\ntightened my boots and walked east along the ruins.\nMost of the wall was just a three-foot-high ridge of packed earth that had\nbeen worn down by the wind and sand. Every two hundred yards or so I\npassed the ruins of a signal tower—a crumbling twenty-foot-high pile of dirt\nstanding uselessly under the burning sun. I followed the wall through a brick\nfactory, and then it swung across an irrigation canal and through a cornfield.\nA mound of sand swallowed the ridge, and I skirted the dune until I saw the\nnext tower rising in the distance. A field of poplars had been planted nearby,\nthe trees thin and brittle-looking under the Shaanxi sun. The Great Wall sank\nto a foot-high mound, and beyond that the lone and level sands stretched far\naway.\nIt was a ragged, patchwork landscape, and the green swaths of corn and\nclusters of poplars spoke of hard work that, in the face of the dunes and the\ndead brown horizon, appeared likely to be wasted. Likewise the ruined wall\nwas a testimony to another sort of wastefulness, because the Ming rulers had\nbuilt the fortification against outsiders who would have been better handled\nthrough diplomacy. And the size of the thing—both its pathetic smallness and\nits amazing bigness; the fact that I could step across it easily and the fact that\nit stretched for fifteen hundred miles—all of that showed how far the Chinese\ncould go with a bad idea.\nBut it also seemed very Chinese that despite its original failure the wall\nnow had great value. It had become perhaps the most powerful symbol of\nnational pride, and nobody connected it with negative qualities like\nisolationism and stubbornness. Television stations often showed a music\nvideo that had been filmed on the Great Wall; the song was called “Love My\nChina,” and it celebrated the nation’s fifty-five minorities and the happiness\nthey enjoyed in the People’s Republic. “Love My China” was a miserable,\n\ncloying song, but like so many of the bad music programs on television it had\na sort of fatal attraction—I always watched it to the bitter end. The song’s\nconclusion featured representative minorities dancing on the Great Wall,\ndressed in traditional costumes as they sang about how much they loved their\nChina. Every time I watched it, I thought: Your China built that wall to keep\nyou people out.\nIt seemed there was always something of this sort on television—at\nvirtually any hour of the day you could find a channel that was focusing on\nsome happy minority, usually the Tibetans. This kind of entertainment struck\nme as uniquely hypocritical, at least until the next year when I returned home\nfrom China and tutored at a public elementary school in Missouri, where the\nchildren celebrated Thanksgiving with traditional stories about the wonderful\nfriendship between the Pilgrims and the Indians. I realized that these myths\nwere a sort of link between America and China—both countries were\narrogant enough to twist some of their greatest failures into sources of pride.\nAnd now that I thought about it, I remembered seeing Indians dance more\nthan a few times on American television.\nBut just like Thanksgiving, the Great Wall had outgrown its original\nsignificance and now it simply meant greatness. Much of what was\ncommonly written about it was false—that it was two thousand years old, that\nit could be seen from space—but the facts didn’t matter. Even as a metaphor\nfor Chinese isolationism it had lost its force, because every foreign dignitary\nwas taken to view the Great Wall near Beijing, and every waiguoren tourist\nvisited it. It was a major attraction of the new open China, a bridge rather\nthan a wall, and it allowed the Chinese to introduce outsiders to the glories of\ntheir country in a single awe-inspiring vista. Rather than keeping the\nbarbarians out, it ensured that after arrival they viewed China with a certain\nrespect, and thus its construction hadn’t really been a waste. It had taken an\nextra five hundred years, but finally the Chinese had made something useful\nout of the Great Wall. And in the same way I knew that the hard-fought\npatches of corn among these sand dunes weren’t wasted; somehow they\nwould survive.\nI followed the wall east for nearly an hour. Sometimes I walked on top\nand the dirt crumbled beneath my feet. I passed another group of poplars,\nstartling a pheasant that crashed away through the underbrush. Lizards\nskittered across the sand. I ran out of water and then I walked back to the fort.\n\nIT WAS IN YULIN that I first realized my Chinese life had turned a corner.\nIt had never been easy to live as a waiguoren in a place like Fuling, where the\npressures could be exhausting—the stifling attention, the constant mocking\nshouts, the ongoing struggle of establishing what a foreigner could and\ncouldn’t do. But there was also another side to these hassles, because the\nChinese were fascinated by waiguoren and once a conversation started they\ntended to treat me much better than the average person. It was very different\nfrom America, where you wouldn’t shout at somebody just because he\nlooked strange, but at the same time you probably wouldn’t go out of your\nway to talk with him or show him kindness.\nIn the spring I had sensed that the benefits were starting to outweigh the\ndifficulties, and mostly it was a matter of developing patience and trust. I had\nto allow things to happen—if somebody approached me, I talked with him,\nand I accepted virtually any invitation. I couldn’t expect to control every\nsituation, and I couldn’t be constantly suspicious of people’s intentions,\nwhich were almost invariably good. To live as a waiguoren required a certain\npassivity, but I had never been a passive person, and it took most of the\nspring to become comfortable with this role. In Yulin, it finally felt right—at\nlast I accepted that things happened best when I simply let them happen.\nOne of the keys was time, which was something I always had in China.\nEven during busy teaching periods in Fuling, I always had plenty of spare\ntime, because so much of what usually occupied me in America had been\nstripped away: family, friends, familiar routines. I had no access to the\nInternet and I couldn’t afford to call people. I could write letters, but the post\nwas so slow that communication was barely possible. When my older sister\ngave birth to a daughter in the fall of my first year, I didn’t find out for three\nweeks.\nIt could be overwhelming to have so much free time, but it was also\nenormously liberating, and there were countless afternoons when I did\nnothing but sit in a teahouse with a newspaper, talking with whoever showed\nup. This became my traveling routine as well; in a new city I’d find a park or\nsomeplace where I could sit and read until a local stopped to chat.\nAfter walking along the wall, I sat in the shade of the Ming fort, writing\n\nin my journal. A few minutes later, three young women paused to ask where I\nwas from, and we talked for a while. They were former middle school\nclassmates who were back in town for a reunion. Another old classmate and\nher husband had opened a restaurant just down the road, and they invited me\nto join them for lunch. The local specialty was something that involved pig\nstomach, so we ate that and drank Yulin beer.\nNone of them could understand why a waiguoren would travel all the\nway to Yulin, until I told them that I had been living in Sichuan. In their eyes\nthis explained a great deal.\n“The people in Sichuan are very jiaohua—sneaky. And their women have\na bad reputation.”\n“They don’t have culture in Sichuan like we do in Shaanxi. Did you\nknow that this is the cradle of Chinese culture?”\n“Have you been to Xi’an? That’s the capital of our Shaanxi and the\nancient capital of China. And that’s why it’s easier to understand us than the\nSichuanese, because our dialect used to be the country’s standard speech. The\nMandarin in Beijing is similar to the way we speak here. In Sichuan the way\nthey talk sounds terrible.”\nThey were right about the dialect—traveling in Shaanxi was like having\nan enormous linguistic weight lifted off my chest. I took the rest of their\nopinions with a grain of salt, because I knew that the Chinese always had\nstrong prejudices about people from other parts of the country. Before I had\nleft Fuling, Teacher Liao had given me a careful introduction to Shaanxi\nprovince.\n“I wish I could visit Xi’an,” she sighed. “You’ll be able to see the terra-\ncotta warriors, the tomb of Emperor Qin Shihuang, and the Forest of Steles.\nYou are very fortunate. But the people from the north are different from us\nhere in the south. They’re bigger, you know, because they eat wheat instead\nof rice, and the women aren’t as pretty as the women here in Sichuan. That’s\nbecause the sun’s so terrible, and there’s too much wind and sand. All of the\nwomen in the north have bad skin.”\nListening to the Shaanxi women criticize Sichuan made me remember\nwhat Teacher Liao had said, and I figured that as a faithful student it was only\nright that I bring up the drawbacks of the north.\n“In Sichuan,” I told the women, “some of my friends say the south is\nbetter than the north, because of the climate. They say many people in the\n\nnorth have bad skin because of the sun. I don’t know if this is true, but that’s\nwhat they told me.”\nThis took nobody by surprise; obviously they had heard these theories\nbefore and there was a ready defense. “That’s true in most parts of the north,”\nagreed Wang Yumei, who was the most talkative of the women. “But Yulin\nis different, because of our water. Our water here is very, very good! It comes\nfrom very deep in the ground, and people say that because of our water the\nwomen here are beautiful. So even though the sun is terrible our skin is still\ngood. Look—my skin isn’t black.”\nI had to admit it was true—there was nothing wrong with Wang Yumei’s\nskin. And I thought that if you could somehow pipe Yulin’s water down to\nFuling you would without a doubt have the most beautiful women in China,\nand perhaps in the entire world, because of the mountains and the rivers and\nthe deep well water of the desert town.\nAfter lunch we went across the street to a Buddhist temple so that Guo\nXiaoqin, who was the only unmarried woman in the group, could have her\nfortune told. As we entered, the priest and a young man were screaming at\neach other. The priest had given the young man a bad fortune, after which he\nhad refused to make a donation, and in the resulting argument the young man\nhad knocked over some things in the temple and the priest had hit him. The\npriest, who was in his sixties, stood in the center of the courtyard, shaking his\nfist. The young man was with a friend who held him back while he screamed\nobscenities. It was very hot now, and the women and I sat in the shade of a\nside temple, waiting for the argument to end.\nAs far as public disputes went, it was average, consisting of two acts. The\nyoung man was dragged out of the courtyard by his friend, but then he fought\nhis way free and stormed back into the temple, where he and the priest\nscreamed at each other for another five minutes. It was clear that the young\nman had no interest in hurting the priest, and certainly it was too late to\nchange his fortune; he was simply saving face, and his friend laughed as he\npushed him back toward the exit. After they were gone, we waited until his\nshouts trailed off into the distance and it was clear that there would not be a\nthird act. Some of the public disputes I had seen in Fuling had so many acts\nthat even the stick-stick soldiers got bored and wandered off.\nThe argument wasn’t a particularly auspicious omen for fortunetelling in\nthis temple, but Guo Xiaoqin, who was twenty-six years old and clearly felt\n\nthat time was an issue, decided to continue. The priest collected himself,\nprayed, and told the woman to kowtow three times before the altar. He struck\na gong as she bowed, and then he gave her a tube filled with wooden sticks.\nShe shook the tube until one of the sticks rattled free, and the priest looked at\nthe number and interpreted the fortune. He said that she would be married\nsoon, perhaps within the year, and everybody sighed with relief. Wang\nYumei gave the priest ten yuan. He smiled as we left.\nWe walked down the road to the Red Cliff Gorge, where Daoist and\nBuddhist temples, some of them more than thirteen centuries old, had been\ncarved into the sandstone cliffs. In the center of the gorge a river flowed clear\nbetween sandy banks. We took off our shoes and waded through the\nshallows, and then we sat in the shade. Across the river a group of six young\npeasants had come to have a picnic. They were men and women in their early\ntwenties, and after lunch they splashed in the river, the women screaming as\nthe men chased them up and down the sandy gorge.\n“Do you have places like this in your country?” Wang Yumei asked. I\ntried to imagine having a reunion with my friends in America and picking up\na random foreigner and spending the day with him, simply out of curiosity\nand kindness.\n“No,” I said. “It’s not quite the same as this in my country.”\nI DIDN’T WANT TO LEAVE YULIN. The hotel was fine and, despite the\nheat of the days, the nights were desert-cool and there was never any problem\nsleeping. The mornings were pleasant, and every day I woke up early and\nwatched the traffic on the main street. Old men swept their shopfronts, and\nwomen dragged milk carts along the main street, and the night soil collectors\nheaded past on their way out to the countryside. Junkmen pulled wagons,\nthumping little hand drums to attract sales. Horse-drawn carts delivered coal\nto the small restaurants, and the sun rose bright above the tiled roofs of the\nbuildings, and slowly the dusty city grew hot.\nThe main street passed beneath three Ming Dynasty towers, and nearly all\nof the other buildings on the street dated to at least the Qing Dynasty. Yulin’s\nancient city wall was still intact, rising twenty feet above the buildings. I had\nnever seen such a well-preserved old town in China, and yet there weren’t\n\nany other foreign tourists in the city.\nEvery day I watched the morning street until it started to become hot, and\nthen I’d buy some yogurt and find a shaded restaurant where I could eat\nsteamed rolls and try to read a newspaper. One morning I bought my yogurt\nfrom an old man who became very excited, gesturing for me to wait while he\nran back home. He returned with an old Chinese book, which he handed to\nme without a word.\nI opened it and tried to read the first page. Some of it was unclear but I\ncould get the general idea—something about the start, earth and water, light\nand dark. The man waited patiently while I read. I made my way through the\nrest of the page, and then I realized what I was reading. I looked up at the old\nman.\n“Are you Christian?” I asked.\n“Yes!” He beamed and shook my hand.\n“Where is this Bible from?”\n“Our friends from Sweden gave it to us,” he said, and I figured they must\nhave been Lutheran missionaries. I told him that I had lived in Sweden as a\nchild, which pleased him. He asked if I was also Christian.\n“I’m Catholic.”\n“Chabuduo, “he said. “That’s almost the same as our Christianity. Most\nof it is the same but you believe more in Mali.”\nHe was right about Mary being a sticking point, but nevertheless he\nseemed happy to meet me. His name was Luo and he invited me to come\nback later, so I could meet his son and grandchildren.\nThe Luos lived on the main street, in a traditional siheyuanr, an old brick\ncomplex organized around a central courtyard. Now there were seven\nbranches of the family living there, all of them named Luo, and the buildings\nhad not changed much in centuries. In the old man’s home they still slept on\na traditional kang, an old-fashioned brick bed that was heated by coal in the\nwinter.\nHe told me that his ancestors had been Qing Dynasty soldiers sent north\nfrom Xi’an in the 1700s to fight the Mongols beyond the wall. They were\nposted here to keep the foreigners at bay, but their descendants came under\nforeign influence anyway—missionaries had converted the old man’s parents\nbefore Liberation. A simple cross hung above his old kang, a curious\nconjunction of relics.\n\nThe old man’s son was named Luo Xiaolei; he was in his mid-forties and\nhe edited a local literary magazine. His daughter had just graduated from the\nChinese department of Yulin Teachers College. They were friendly, well-\neducated people, and during the week I spent in Yulin I went to their home\nevery day. Often they served me a late breakfast, and after eating we would\nsit with tea and watermelon in the shade of their living room.\nLuo Xiaolei had spent five years in prison during the Cultural Revolution,\nbecause he was an intellectual and a Christian, and his father had been exiled\nto ten years of labor in a remote part of the desert. The old man didn’t say\nmuch about that experience, except that the work was difficult and served no\npurpose. That was often the way people described their exiles—the wasted\ntime was the worst part.\nI found it easy to speak openly with the Luos, because their experiences\nhad made them skeptical, and because soon I would leave this place. That\nwas the best part of traveling—I wasn’t really accountable for things I did\nand said; I could wander off with anybody and talk about anything I wanted.\nIt wasn’t like living in Fuling, where people kept track of me and there was\nalways the knowledge that I still had another year left in the river town. There\nwere many good things about having a home in China, but that was one of\nthe drawbacks.\nOne afternoon, Luo Xiaolei asked me what I thought about teaching in\nChina, and I realized that it was a difficult question.\n“Mostly I like it very much,” I said, “and especially I like the students. I\nthink they respect teachers more than we do in America. I teach literature,\nand that’s also good; my Chinese students like poetry more than most\nAmerican students do. But I don’t like the political system in the college. It’s\nhard to explain—sometimes this system affects the students. Many of their\nideas are very xia’aide—narrow.”\nTeacher Kong had taught me that word near the end of the semester, and\nit summarized the difficult aspects of Fuling. Luo Xiaolei nodded. “Probably\nthey aren’t used to waiguoren yet,” he said. “In remote parts of China you\nknow that we have not had very many.”\n“I know, but there are other problems, too. Their books are bad, and\nsometimes what they study isn’t true.”\nI asked his daughter, who was sitting with us, if they studied Confucius in\nthe Chinese department of her college.\n\n“No,” she said.\n“But you study Marx?”\n“Yes.”\n“It’s the same way in Fuling. My students read Shakespeare and Marx,\nbut they don’t read Confucius. Those are foreign ideas, and Confucius is part\nof your culture, but nobody studies him anymore.”\n“Did you study Marx in college in America?” she asked.\n“Yes, but only a little. Many college students do in America, because he’s\na philosopher.”\n“What do they think of Marxism in your America?”\n“Most people think it is interesting, but it’s not very…” I was groping for\nthe word and she knew what I was thinking.\n“Shiyong, “she said. “Useful.”\n“Right. It’s not very useful.”\n“I agree,” she said. “I think it’s a waste of time. Most of the politics we\nstudy are a waste of time.” She flipped her hair away from her face and\nlooked across the room at her father. He was thinking of something else, and\nthen he smiled when he realized that his daughter expected him to respond.\nHe was a gray-haired man with round glasses and his eyes were bright with\nmemory.\n“No,” he said. “Marxism is not very useful.” And his own father, who\nwas sitting in the shadows eating watermelon, said nothing at all.\nI FOLLOWED A REGULAR ROUTINE IN YULIN, visiting the Luos\nduring the morning and eating at a small restaurant in the afternoon. The\nrestaurant had good dumplings, along with cheap local beer, and the owner\nwas the sort of tough no-nonsense woman who could often be found in places\nwhere men went drinking after work. She teased me about my accent, which\nshe said was half foreign and half Sichuanese, and whenever other customers\ncame into the restaurant she announced my vital information: nationality, age,\nChinese name, danwei, and salary. Usually the customers remarked the\nlowness of my salary and bought me a beer. To maintain my dignity, I\nexplained the nature of the Peace Corps, and how we had come to build\nfriendship between America and China rather than make money, which\n\ninvariably inspired the customers to buy me another beer. I tried to cover the\nthird round, usually without success. After that we would shake hands\nwarmly and say something about the improving relations between our\nnations, and I would return to my hotel and sleep until it cooled to evening.\nOn my last day in Yulin, two men in their late twenties came into the\nrestaurant and began buying me drinks. One of them was named Wang and\nthe other was Zhao. They said I could call them Comrade. It was Friday and\nthey had just finished working the morning shift in a nearby factory.\nEach of us finished two beers quickly, and during the next beer the two\nmen began to turn red and tell stories about Chinese history. Comrade Wang\ntold me about Emperor Yu, who had been the first to control the floods of the\nYellow River. This was a story I had studied in my textbook, which was\nfortunate because Comrade Wang’s version frequently became entangled in\nthe local dialect. I kept nodding and acting as if I understood, and\nperiodically Comrade Zhao would interrupt him:\n“Speak Mandarin! He’s not going to understand if you speak the dialect!”\nComrade Wang would nod and speak a few sentences in Mandarin, and\nthen he would drift back toward the dialect as Emperor Yu made more heroic\nefforts to build dikes and levees along the Yellow River. The gist of the tale\nwas that Emperor Yu had worked so hard that although he often passed the\ndoorway of his family home, he never had time to stop and visit. It was a hell\nof a project, controlling the Yellow River.\nFinally the river was under control and Comrade Wang sat back and\ndrained his beer. They were buying bottles and our table was full of empties.\nOne of the many good things about small Chinese restaurants was that they\nnever cleared the bottles until you left, which meant that passersby could\nglance over and see how much damage you had done by two in the afternoon.\nThere was big face in that and today we were doing fine.\n“Did you understand the story?” Comrade Zhao asked. “You didn’t\nunderstand, did you? He kept speaking our dialect!”\nI said that everything was clear, reciting the version from my textbook.\n“You see?” Comrade Wang was triumphant. “He understood all of it!”\nThere was a sudden need to show me Comrade Wang’s investment down\nthe street, and the owner agreed to hold our table until we returned. They\nwere both big men, and I walked between them, the three of us stumbling\nunsteadily over the cobblestones. We passed Mr. Luo’s stand and I waved. I\n\nhad no idea where we were going, or what the investment was—that was all\nthey said, that we were going to see Comrade Wang’s investment. It was a\nhot afternoon and after the beer we were sweating as we walked down the\nstreet.\nWe entered a doorway and climbed a narrow flight of stairs. On the\nsecond floor there was a big room and a single girl in roller skates was\nspinning around the hardwood floor.\n“This,” said Comrade Wang, “is my investment.”\nProudly he looked out over the roller rink, and then he went over to the\nconcessions area and talked with the worker.\n“The investment was too much,” Comrade Zhao whispered mournfully,\nonce Comrade Wang was out of earshot. “He had to borrow too much money.\nHe’ll never pay it back!”\nI could see that Comrade Wang was telling the worker something about\nme and I strained to hear.\n“They don’t have enough people coming,” Comrade Zhao whispered.\n“And last night there was a fight and some glass was broken. He’s going to\nlose so much money!”\nComrade Wang returned with roller skates and presented them to me.\n“Here,” he said. “You skate. Now. For free.”\nI stuttered, explaining that I didn’t know how to roller-skate. “Of course\nyou know how!” said Comrade Wang. “It comes from your country!”\nI told them that I had a hurt leg, and they offered to take me to a doctor.\nThere was one down the street, Comrade Zhao said, and Chinese medicine\nwas very effective. I explained that I knew the benefits of Chinese medicine,\nbecause a Chinese doctor had told me to sit down as much as possible and\navoid activities like roller-skating. After many polite offers and protests, we\nsolved the problem by going back to the restaurant, sitting down, and having\nanother beer. They didn’t seem offended; Comrade Wang was pleased that he\nhad been able to show me his investment. The empties were still on the table.\nWe finished another round and Comrade Wang looked me in the eye.\n“He Wei,” he said, using my Chinese name. “The only other time I saw\nan American was on Mount Emei, and I didn’t have a good impression. He\nwas very fat, and he was telling people to do things for him. “Do this! Do\nthat!” He had workers carry him up the mountain, like he was a great\nlandlord. But you’re different—before I met you, I thought that all Americans\n\nare bad, but now I know that’s not the truth.”\nI was touched, and I felt guilty that I had lied about seeing the doctor. But\nit was a Chinese type of white lie and probably that made it all right. I\nthanked Comrade Wang and we toasted each other.\n“Also, that American on Mount Emei was very white,” he said. “His skin\nwas so white and bad-looking! But you’re actually a little yellow—you look\nmore Chinese. Your skin is much better than his!”\nEVERYTHING WENT WELL that summer. I studied at a college in Xi’an,\nwhere the classes were not too difficult, and the city had plenty of good parks\nwhere you could buy a cup of tea and chat with the locals. Every day it was\nthirty-five degrees Celsius (ninety-five degrees Fahrenheit). Supposedly the\ngovernment had a policy that if the temperature reached thirty-seven degrees\neverybody was given the rest of the day off, and so they always announced\nthe official temperature as thirty-five. Often I rode a friend’s bicycle over to\nXingqing Palace Park, where I’d get a cup of tea and ask the workers what\nthe temperature was.\n“Thirty-five degrees,” they’d say, fanning themselves with newspapers.\n“What was the temperature yesterday?”\n“Thirty-five degrees.”\n“How hot do you think it’ll be tomorrow?”\nThey’d roll their eyes and tell me to go drink my tea; it wasn’t much of a\njoke to them. China was perhaps the only country in the world where the\ngovernment controlled the temperature, although two years later the Beijing\nweather stations finally started announcing the temperature as it actually was.\nLocal newspapers hailed this development as an important step toward telling\ncitizens the truth, and perhaps it was: today the temperature, tomorrow the\nfull report on the Tiananmen Square massacre. But the government also made\nit clear that the policy of giving a day off was merely a myth, so the new\ntemperatures didn’t result in any vacations. It just meant that you knew\nexactly how hot it really was.\nXi’an was the hottest thirty-five degrees imaginable and at night I had\ntrouble sleeping, but even with the heat everything went well that summer.\nMy sister Angela, who was a graduate student in geology at Stanford, had\n\nbeen sent out to a summer project in Xinjiang, the province in the far west of\nChina. She spent a week with me in Xi’an and together we saw the historical\nsights of the city. I always told people that she was helping China find oil in\nXinjiang, while I was a volunteer English teacher in Sichuan; this pleased\neveryone and they gave us special treatment. The worker at the terra-cotta\nwarriors museum was so inspired that he let us in for the Chinese price,\nwaiving the waiguoren surcharge, because of the good work we were doing\nfor China.\nAngela flew out to her project, and a week later I finished my studies and\ncaught a train to Xinjiang. It was a forty-eight-hour trip along the old Silk\nRoad, through the deserts of Gansu and Xinjiang provinces, and I had always\nliked long train trips and big empty landscapes.\nI traveled hard sleeper, which I considered to be the most enjoyable class\non a Chinese train. Hard seat was a nightmare, a crush of peasants and\nmigrant workers; soft sleeper was too much in the other direction, cadres and\noverfed businessmen and waiguoren tourists. Hard sleeper cars weren’t\nuncomfortable—everybody had a berth—but the tickets were cheap enough\nfor travelers who considered themselves Old Hundred Names, the common\npeople. Old Hundred Names were always easy to talk with, especially on\ntrains, where they chatted lightly, drinking their tea and eating instant\nnoodles.\nOn the first day, a young man from Hebei province came and sat across\nfrom me, watching the Gansu hills slip past. He was twenty-five years old,\nand he had worked in Xinjiang for two years, and he did not like it. Xinjiang\nwas too extreme, he said—too hot in the summer, too cold in the winter. He\nhad just finished four months of vacation, and it was not pleasant to take a\nforty-eight-hour train trip and know that at its conclusion you had to start\nwork again in a place like Xinjiang. His job involved safety management for\nan oil company.\n“Every year, two or three workers are killed,” he said. “Especially on the\nroads in the desert. The transportation is terrible in Xinjiang, and that’s why\nworkers die every year. There’s not much we can do about it.”\nI told him that my younger sister was looking for oil near Turpan. He\nshrugged, as if to say: She can have it. Outside there was a dusty streak of\nlow hills and the land was getting steadily drier as the train rocked west.\nHe was bright and it wasn’t the sort of rote conversation that I often had\n\nin China. There was something quietly sharp about his eyes—he had a heavy-\nlidded gaze but I could see that he took careful notice of everything around\nhim. He saw that I was jotting in my notebook, but unlike most people he\ndidn’t ask what I was writing, probably because he guessed the truth. Usually\nI told people that it was my diary, or sometimes I simply said, “I’m writing\nmy foreign language.” That was enough to satisfy nearly everyone—if you\nknew a foreign language, it was obvious that you would spend a great deal of\ntime writing it. Nobody seemed to realize that in fact I was writing about\nthem and everything else around me, but the man from Hebei watched my\npen skim impulsively over the pages and I sensed that he knew that he was\nbeing described. But he still spoke freely; we talked lightly about politics,\nand the Communist Party, and I asked him if he was a member.\n“No,” he said. “I don’t want to be.”\n“Why not?”\n“Too much trouble. My friends—and most young people—all of us are\nthe same. We’re not interested in that. It’s not the same as your America. We\nonly have one party in our China.”\nThe differences between these countries interested him. “All Chinese like\nAmericans,” he said, a while later. “But many Americans think there are\nproblems with human rights here. In fact, Old Hundred Names doesn’t care\nabout that. Old Hundred Names worries about eating, about having enough\nclothes. Look out there.”\nHe pointed out the window—a dusty village, garbage beside the tracks, a\nskinny donkey followed by a peasant in blue. Old Hundred Names.\n“Do you think people like that worry about democracy?” he said. “They\nneed to improve their living standard and then they can start thinking about\nother things. That’s the problem with America and China—you can’t\ncompare them in the same breath.”\nWe slipped away from politics; he talked of marriage and how after three\nmore years he would find a wife. There were often schedules like this for the\nyoung Chinese I knew; they were pragmatists about love as well as politics\nand nearly everything else. The young man explained his reasons—in three\nyears he would be twenty-eight years old, which was neither too old nor too\nyoung, and by then he should have enough money to get married. It took a\ngreat deal of money to marry, he said, and it wasn’t something you wanted to\ndo in a place like Xinjiang. In three years he hoped to live in Hebei, or\n\nperhaps Qingdao, the former German concession on the east coast. He spoke\nlovingly of Qingdao, of the beautiful red roofs and the clean streets, the\nfriendly people and the calm sea; and meanwhile our train rocked steadily\nwest into the desert.\nIt was a long, empty day—nothing to see out the window, nothing to do\non the train. I sat and talked with people for a couple of hours, and then I\nclimbed up to my bunk. We passed through Lanzhou, the capital of Gansu\nprovince, where the smog hung limp above the sullen stain of the Yellow\nRiver, and I fell asleep. When I awoke everything had changed—we were in\na bright landscape of green grass and yellow rapeseed, and dune-shaped hills\nrolled off toward the horizon.\nA fertilizer salesman materialized and began to ask me questions about\nmoney. How much is a new car in America? A used car? What about the\nlicense fee? Taxes? Insurance? In a notebook he scrawled my responses—\nguesses, all of them—and I was glad to see that somebody else on this train\nwas writing. But what were they growing in this desolate place that required\nfertilizer?\n“Wheat and corn,” he said. “Of course, there are grapes as well, and other\nfruit, but there are grain crops near Urumqi. But the fertilizer we make is\nshipped back into the interior.” He returned to the money questions: How\nmuch is a house in America? What are the unemployment benefits? What\nkind of insurance does the government give you?\nAfter that was finished we sat in silence, looking out the window. I felt I\nshould continue the conversation, but there were only so many questions you\ncould ask about fertilizer. I asked him when he had come to Xinjiang.\n“I was born here,” he said.\n“When did your parents come?”\n“My parents came to Xinjiang in the 1950s, after Liberation. They came\nto help build the country. It was like America.”\nWe stared at the scene outside: a shepherd with his flock in a green field,\na man in blue riding a bicycle along a dusty road, a row of mud houses\nsurrounded by earth-colored walls, a range of craggy white peaks to the\nsouth, and, westward, a broad empty horizon of the sort I had rarely seen in\nChina. There were no trees for miles.\n“Go west, young man,” said the fertilizer salesman, remembering a\nphrase from history class long ago.\n\nSOMETIME DURING THE SECOND NIGHT our train passed Jiayu\nPass, the westernmost fort of the Great Wall. I didn’t see that barrier, but in\nthe morning it was clear that a line had been crossed. There were no villages\nor walls, only rocks and dust and low rugged hills that were sharply\nshadowed by the desert sun.\nWe had come to the edge of China—or rather, a figurative edge of China,\nbecause you could continue westward for another thousand miles and still be\nwithin the country’s borders. But this was the end of where the Han, or ethnic\nChinese, traditionally lived, and now we were reaching the uncertain regions\nof the Silk Road. The Chinese called this province the Xinjiang Uighur\nAutonomous Region; the Uighurs were the indigenous people, and they\ncalled this land Turkistan or Uighurstan, and they wanted it for themselves.\nXinjiang means New Frontier, and for more than two thousand years it\nhad slipped in and out of China, until at last the Communists took firm\ncontrol of the region in 1949. But it was a difficult place to govern—it\nbordered Tibet, India, Pakistan, Tajikstan, Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan,\nMongolia; it composed one-sixth of China’s total land area, containing a\nwealth of oil and minerals; and the majority of its residents, the Uighurs,\nwere Muslims who spoke a Turkish tongue and had nothing in common with\nthe Han Chinese. All of these factors made Xinjiang a complex place, and in\nFebruary of that year there had been violence in the northern reaches of the\nprovince. For them the most immediate issue was keeping the Han out—four\ndecades ago, only 15 percent of the region’s population had been Chinese,\nbut now that figure had swelled to nearly 50 percent. The Han came to do\nmany jobs—to work as soldiers, as government cadres, as fertilizer salesmen\n—and they kept coming, arriving on trains like this. In my car there was not a\nsingle Uighur, but there were plenty of Han who were heading west to work.\nThe tension was something that nobody on the train wanted to talk about\n—a few times I asked about the problems of the spring, but everybody was\nevasive. A woman in her forties told me that she didn’t understand the issue,\nbecause she was simply Old Hundred Names. That was the best part of being\nOld Hundred Names—they were never responsible for anything. It was the\nsame way in any country where the citizens spoke of themselves as the\n\n“common people,” but in China there was a much higher percentage of Old\nHundred Names than in most places. Virtually everybody you met described\nhimself as such, and none of them claimed to have anything to do with the\nway things worked.\nAfter establishing herself as Old Hundred Names, the woman started\nasking me Da Shan questions. Da Shan was a Canadian who spoke Chinese\nfluently and appeared frequently on television, and he was without a doubt\nthe most famous waiguoren in China. He was what people called a\nZhongguotong—a foreigner who “knew about China,” or, essentially, a\nChina hand. On good language days people referred to me as a\nZhongguotong, but I knew it was only flattery. I had a long way to go before\nI could be accepted a China hand, and from what I had seen of Da Shan, this\nwasn’t a particularly appealing goal. Probably he was a nice enough person,\nbut in his “cross-talk” comedy routines and opera singing there was more\nthan a touch of the trained monkey.\nPeople everywhere asked me about Da Shan, and his fame testified to\nhow badly foreigners did with the Chinese language. It was the equivalent of\nAmericans becoming fascinated with a Chinese person simply because he\nspoke idiomatic English.\n“Do you know Da Shan?” the woman asked. “You speak our Chinese\nwell, but you’re not as good as Da Shan.”\n“Yes, he speaks much better than me.” This was why most waiguoren in\nChina hated Da Shan: the more your Chinese improved, and the more you\nchatted with Old Hundred Names, the more you heard about Da Shan and\nhow much better than you he was.\n“Do you know him?” the woman asked. This was another common\nassumption—that all waiguoren who studied Chinese knew each other,\nmaintaining contact through an intricate nationwide system, like the\nFreemasons.\n“No,” I said. “I have never met Da Shan.”\n“He’s very good at the cross-talk—he’s very funny.”\n“Dui. I’ve seen him do it. Indeed he is very good.”\n“Da Shan speaks Mandarin better than most Chinese,” the woman said.\n“Yes. That is what many people tell me.”\n“And he can sing our traditional Chinese songs. Is he from your\nAmerica?”\n\n“No. He’s from their Canada.”\n“What do people in your America think of Da Shan?”\n“We don’t have Da Shan on television in our America. Nobody in our\nAmerica knows who he is.”\n“So he’s only on television in their Canada?”\n“He’s not on television in their Canada, either. The only place where he is\non television is China.”\nFor the woman, like many of the Chinese that I met, this was a great\ndisappointment. It was tragic for a nation to produce somebody as gifted as\nDa Shan and allow a foreign country to monopolize his skills. But in fact, as I\nexplained to the woman, this is a common pattern in Canada, where all talent\nleaves the country as soon as possible, just like NHL franchises. She thought\nabout this for a while and then continued talking about Da Shan.\n“He has a Chinese wife,” she said. “Have you heard that?”\n“Yes,” I said. I had heard every theory there was about Da Shan.\nOccasionally people said that his grandmother was Chinese, which seemed\nunlikely given that he was blond. His Chinese teacher had also become\nfamous, and sometimes people recommended that I move to the east of China\nand seek out this pedagogue, the way itinerant scholars had done more than\ntwo thousand years ago during the Spring and Autumn Period. I had a good\nstart in Chinese, they said, and it was a shame to waste that in a place like\nSichuan, where even the locals couldn’t speak the language.\n“Do you know what Da Shan’s salary is?” I asked. I wanted to talk about\nanything else, and money sounded promising.\n“He makes thousands of yuan every month,” the woman said with\ncertainty. “He has a very good salary. How much do you make?”\n“One thousand yuan.”\n“That’s not as much as Da Shan.”\n“No,” I said. “It’s not as much as Da Shan.”\n“But it’s enough,” she said. “For a young man who is single, one\nthousand yuan is enough.”\n“Yes. It’s a better salary than most people in Fuling, where I live. Have\nyou heard of Fuling? It’s in Sichuan.”\nShe thought hard and shook her head.\n“I’m sure you’ve heard of Fuling hot pickled mustard tuber,” I said. “It’s\nvery famous in China. Have you seen the advertisements on television?” And\n\nI sang the jingle:\nWu River brand,\nFuling hot pickled mustard tuber!\nIt sounded much better in Chinese than it does in English, and the woman\nrecognized it immediately. All of the Chinese were familiar with Fuling hot\npickled mustard tuber and that was the easiest way to tell people where I was\nfrom. The woman and I talked for a while longer, and then she said\nsomething tactful about our China becoming more open to foreign countries.\nI thanked her and she returned to her part of the car.\nThe train grew hotter as we passed into the Turpan-Hami Basin, where\nthe earth beside the tracks was cracked by the sun. The hills in the distance\ndropped steadily, and with them the horizon fell lower and lower, until at last\nthe land was perfectly flat and the clear sky sat like a great dome of blue\nstretched taut above the black earth.\nWe stopped for an hour in the oasis city of Hami, where the station signs\nwere in Arabic script as well as Chinese. It was the first place on this journey\nwhere I saw Uighurs; they were standing on the station platform, selling\ngrapes and melons. The Uighurs had long sun-browned noses, and their\nfeatures would have been at home in Saudi Arabia, or Turkey, or even Italy.\nCenturies ago many of them were caravan people, nomads who bought and\nsold along the Silk Road, and even today some spark of that same spirit\ninspires them to travel across China in search of business. Uighurs often work\nas black-market moneychangers in big cities, where they also sell raisins and\nfruitcake. Even in Fuling it is common for a couple of them to set up a\nfruitcake and raisin stand on a downtown street. They follow the Yangtze\nwith their bushel baskets, drifting east, stopping in a city for a few weeks and\nthen moving on. Of all the small entrepreneurs I saw in China, the Uighurs\nwere the most remarkable—you’d find them two thousand miles away from\nhome, and yet all they had was a basket of raisins and a tray of fruitcake. I\nhad no idea how they made money.\nAt Hami the safety management worker and I stood there watching the\nfruit salesmen, and I asked him about relations between the Han and the\n\nUighurs.\n“We have problems,” he said. “Sometimes the guanxi is bad. Now our\ngovernment helps their education, agriculture, economy, but still there are\nproblems. It’s because of the history, not today’s policy. Every country has\nthis kind of trouble—you have the same kind of problems with blacks in your\nAmerica.”\nIt was a good point, and I told him that I didn’t think Xinjiang’s troubles\nwere America’s affair. But I said that if it was a Chinese affair, it seemed\nstrange that the violence in the spring hadn’t been discussed in the\nnewspapers in Chongqing and Fuling.\n“Sichuan is too remote. Bigger cities heard about what happened here.”\n“What happened?”\n“There were bombs,” he said, shrugging. “It was like Israel.”\n“Does your company have any Uighur workers?”\n“No. Their education level isn’t high enough, and if it’s not high enough,\nit’s not safe. If their level was appropriate, we’d hire them.”\n“Do you speak Uighur?”\n“No. You don’t need it here. You always use Chinese at work and when\nyou go shopping.”\n“Do you know any words?”\n“I know a few. Salaam aleikum is ‘hello.’ And ‘thank you’ is…”\nHe paused, thinking hard. He had lived in the Uighur Autonomous\nRegion for two years. “I forget,” he said at last. “But I know ‘goodbye.’”\nAnd he said it, but he spoke softly and the word was lost in the hot desert\nwind that swept through the station.\nTHE OASIS TOWNS appeared every hour or two, rising suddenly\nalongside the tracks and then disappearing just as quickly into the rock and\ndirt and sand. They weren’t oases in the romantic sense: no palms or shining\npools of water; just concrete and dust and glass. It was as if the oases and the\ndesert had been reversed; we would roll out of town and I would breathe a\nsigh of relief, unable to imagine that once these places had been inviting to\ntravellers. The land was barren but it was also mesmerizing, and the towns\nhad no charm.\n\nI would have been happy to continue like that for days, passing from\noasis to oasis, watching the great nothingness beside the tracks. The train was\ncomfortable and the people friendly; I was the only waiguoren of our car and\noften the other passengers brought me food and drink—tomatoes, cucumbers,\nflavored ices, dried fish, beer. Occasionally somebody stopped by to talk\nabout prices or Sino-American relations, but at last it was as if the wasteland\nhad swallowed all conversation. Nearly everybody sat silent, staring out at\nthe scenery.\nThe Flaming Mountains rose to the south, red and scarred by countless\nridges, and then the Heavenly Mountains came into view. Snow was streaked\nbright in the high peaks. It grew dark; a full moon hung heavy in the eastern\nsky. The train rocked westward. It seemed we’d never get to Urumqi, but I\ndidn’t care.\nTHERE WERE CHECKPOINTS on the Xinjiang highways where\npolicemen with machine guns inspected all vehicles. It was unusual for\nChinese policemen to handle weapons like that, and in Xinjiang they were\nvery proud of the responsibility, fiddling constantly with the clip and the\nhandle. They couldn’t simply carry the guns on their straps—the point of\nhaving a weapon was to keep it constantly in their hands, aimed at something.\nIt was like giving an automatic rifle to a child. I took a bus from Urumqi to\nTurpan, and the policeman at the checkpoint used the barrel of his machine\ngun to motion bluntly at the passengers as he inspected our identification.\nThe tension in the big cities was palpable; conversations with Uighurs\ndidn’t last very long before they started complaining. They complained about\nthe number of Han migrants, and they complained about how all the good\ngovernment jobs went to the Han, and they complained about the planned-\nbirth policy, even though for Uighurs the limit was extended to two children\nand was imposed only in urban areas. I wasn’t particularly surprised to see\nthat the problems of the spring hadn’t blown over; everything I had learned\nabout the Chinese suggested that they would be particularly bad colonists.\nThey tended to have strong ideas about race, they rarely respected religion,\nand they had trouble considering a non-Chinese point of view. One of the\nbest characteristics of the people I knew in Fuling was that they had a\n\npowerful pride in their own culture—I had never lived in a place where the\npeople had such a strong sense of their unique cultural identity. Despite the\nself-destruction of the Cultural Revolution and the subsequent rush to open to\nthe outside world, there was still a definite sense of what was Chinese, and I\nbelieved that this would help them survive modernization. But there was also\na narrowness to this concept, and it seemed nearly impossible for a Chinese\nto go to a place like Xinjiang, learn the language, and make friends with the\nlocals. In the five thousand years of their history it was striking how little\ninterest the Chinese had had in exploration, and today that same characteristic\nlimited them, even within their own borders. They seemed completely\ncontent in being Chinese, and they assumed that this feeling was shared by\neverybody else.\nWhen the Han went to western places like Xinjiang or Tibet, their initial\nreaction was that the people needed to become more like the country’s\ninterior, particularly with regard to modernization, even if it came at the\nexpense of culture. I had trouble understanding this perspective; to me it\nseemed that already too many beautiful places had been modernized too\nquickly, and I felt that the relatively untouched corners of China should be\nleft that way. But I had never been poor, which made a great difference in the\nway you saw a place like Xinjiang.\nEverything looked different to the average Chinese, and I had gained\nsome sense of their perspective when my writing class studied the American\nWest in the fall. We discussed Western expansion, and I presented my\nstudents with a dilemma of the late nineteenth century: the Plains Indians,\ntheir culture in jeopardy, were being pressed by white settlers. I asked my\nclass to imagine that they were American citizens proposing a solution, and\nnearly all responded like the following two students:\nThe Indians should become a part of American society like everyone\nelse. Even though they are poor and savage, we can help them found\nreservations to make them civilized, and give them advanced\nknowledges and experiences to change their lifestyle and develop their\neconomy. By this way, we can make them become rich and be suited for\nmodern life. At last, the Indians can get along well with us and advance\ntogether.\n\nThe world is changing and developing. We should make the Indians\nsuit our modern life. The Indians are used to living all over the plains\nand moving frequently, without a fixed home, but it is very impractical\nin our modern life…. We need our country to be a powerful country; we\nmust make the Indians adapt to our modern life and keep pace with the\nsociety. Only in this way can we strengthen the country.\nThat was the first time I realized how different our perspectives were on\nprogress and modernization. If anything, I had presented them with an\nidealized version of the Plains Indians, and yet the lifestyle and culture had\nno appeal to my students. But like most Chinese, the majority were but one\ngeneration removed from serious poverty. What I saw as freedom and\nculture, they saw as misery and ignorance.\nAnd Xinjiang, as well as Tibet, looked much the same. The Han that I\nmet in Xinjiang couldn’t understand why the Uighurs didn’t appreciate\nChina’s efforts; they pointed out how backward the region had been before\nLiberation, emphasizing the work that had been done by the government.\nThere was no question that this was true—the government had built roads,\nrailways, schools. But the Chinese had failed to take the logical first step;\nthey had never made a serious effort to understand and respect the Uighur\nculture, and settlers rarely learned the local language. The result was that\ntremendous amounts of money and work had been sunk into the desert, but\nwith regard to improving relations much of it had been completely wasted.\nI found myself oddly situated in the middle of this tension. The Uighurs\ndisliked speaking the language of the Han, and in tourist areas some of them\nspoke better Japanese or English than Chinese. There was a certain distrust of\nforeigners who spoke Chinese; it was better if you used English. This was\nhard for me to do—all summer I had enjoyed the benefits of becoming\nconversational in Chinese, but now my use of the language established me as\nan outsider, and a politically charged outsider at that.\nIn addition to the language, there was a host of new cultural rules that\ncomplicated my interactions with the Uighurs. They were very different\n\npeople from the Chinese I knew in Fuling—the Uighurs showed emotion,\nangering easily, and I found bargaining unpleasant because sometimes the\nroutine involved a mock show of anger or disgust. I missed the even\npredictability of the Chinese; I was accustomed to their social rules, and I\nknew how they would react to the things I did and said. There was something\ncomforting about all of those rote dialogues—the conversations about my\nsalary, U.S.-China relations, and Da Shan. In Xinjiang I found myself\ngravitating to Chinese restaurants and shops, and especially I liked talking\nwith the Sichuanese, who had migrated to Xinjiang in large numbers. After a\nsummer on the road it was good to hear their slurred tones again—much\nmore soothing than the Turkic trills of the Uighur tongue. And I realized that\nI had picked up some of that distinctly Chinese narrowness: I was also\ncontent in being Chinese, even here in Xinjiang.\nBut things were different if I didn’t say anything. I have some Italian\nancestry and don’t look too much different from the Uighurs, and I could\nwalk down the street and not attract attention. Occasionally I was mistaken\nfor a native—the Chinese sometimes asked if I was a Uighur, and the\nUighurs sometimes asked if I was a Kazakh. In Fuling I was always\nextremely conscious of my appearance, because every day I was confronted\nby the ways in which I looked different from the locals, but now in these\ndesert towns I saw people with noses and hair and eyes like mine. For the\nfirst time I realized the full importance of race, not just in the way it divided\npeople, but also in the sense of feeling a link to those who looked like you.\nFor a year I hadn’t felt that connection, but here in Xinjiang, although the\nlink was tenuous, it was better than nothing.\nMy vacation was winding down, but I had no eagerness to leave. I liked\nthe lazy freedom of traveling, and I liked the uncertainty of my position here\nin Xinjiang, where I had no job and even my race was in question. It was a\nvague place—even time was uncertain here. All of China is on one time zone,\nwhich meant that in Xinjiang the sun didn’t rise until eight or nine o’clock\nand it set after ten at night. Most of the people followed a more practical\nschedule, based on a mythical local time zone that was two hours later than\nthe one in Beijing, but all of the government offices and state-run\ntransportation followed the official standard time. It was the perfect symbol\nof the divide between the government and the governed, both of them living\nin the same place but going about their separate routines a full two hours\n\napart.\nMostly in Xinjiang I liked the brutal landscapes. For three days I camped\nat altitudes of more than ten thousand feet in the Heavenly Mountains, and a\nday later I was in Turpan, where the desert basin dipped to five hundred feet\nbelow sea level and the Flaming Mountains rose north of town. Turpan was\nso hot that even the government couldn’t control the temperature. Every day I\nwas there, it reached forty-two degrees, 107 Fahrenheit, and it was reported\nas such. Shops closed during midday, so everybody could rest inside until the\nworst of the heat had passed.\nIt was almost as hot in Hami, where my sister Angela was looking at\nrocks. Along with another Stanford geologist, she was employed by a\nChinese state-owned oil company that had built an entire city outside of\nHami. It was literally a city—schools, hospitals, shops, apartment buildings;\neverything was neatly laid out on well-planned streets that had been desert\nwasteland but four years ago. There were fifty thousand employees who\nworked there, all of them Han Chinese who had been shipped in from Gansu\nprovince. When I went to the market, people mistook me for a Uighur,\nbecause they had seen so few of the locals. The Chinese rarely left the\ncomplex; everything they needed was provided by their oil-built oasis in the\ndesert.\nAnd yet the city was a mirage. There wasn’t much oil in Hami, at least\naccording to Angela and her colleague, who knew the region’s geology. All\nof it was a mystery—why had they built the city here in the desert? Why had\nall of these people been transferred out to this desolate place? What were they\nlooking for? In five hundred years, would it be like the Great Wall, money\nand work buried in the sand? What was it about the Chinese that made them\ncome slightly unhinged in the border regions—what inspired them to build\nwalls, forts, cities; why did they construct Ozymandian monstrosities in the\nfar reaches of their country? And what prevented them from actually talking\nwith the people who lived there?\nBut these were mysteries that I didn’t have time to untangle. I was in\nHami for three short days—I stayed in Angela’s hotel, along with Adam\nWeiss, another Peace Corps volunteer, who had met me in Turpan. And then\nour time was up, and Weiss and I left the city in the desert, catching a train\nback to Chengdu.\n\nTHE TRAIN TO CHENGDU TOOK FIFTY HOURS and I had a bad\nfeeling about it from the moment Weiss and I tried to buy tickets. They\nwouldn’t sell us sleeper berths at the Hami station, and all they said was that\nwe could try to upgrade our hard seat tickets once we boarded.\nSchool was about to start, and the train was full of college students who\nwere returning to Sichuan. There weren’t any sleeping berths left, and there\nweren’t any open spots in the hard seat cars. People were stuffed in the aisles,\nsitting on their luggage, leaning against each other. The walkways between\ncars were packed with passengers squatting on the floor. People sat in the\nsinks. It was the most crowded train I had ever seen in China.\nFifty hours is a long time to ride on a train without seats. For the first\nnight Weiss and I did the best we could in the aisle, sitting on our bags, but it\nwas impossible to sleep and always there were people coming through and\nbumping us. The worker in charge of our car was annoyed by the crowd, and\nout of spite she mopped the entire carriage three times during the first\nevening. In order for her to do this, all of us had to stand up and hold our\nluggage over our heads while she pushed at our feet with the dirty mop. She\nmopped at eight o’clock, ten o’clock, and midnight. Everybody grumbled but\nnobody resisted; in China you tolerated the bad behavior of the people who\nwere employed to serve you, the same way you tolerated bullies and all other\nhassles of that sort. Or you tried to leave, which is what Weiss and I finally\ndid, scouting out a different car where the worker seemed more reasonable. It\nwas an improvement, but we were still standing in the aisle as the train\nplodded east through the desert.\nIt wasn’t the sort of trip that inspires positive thoughts. Weiss and I\ndiscussed other Peace Corps volunteers in our group, and things they did that\nannoyed us, and we talked about the new volunteers who had recently arrived\nand how badly they would do this year. We complained about the various\nwaiguoren we had seen over the course of the summer. We watched the other\npassengers in the car, criticizing their flaws. We discussed things we would\ndo and eat whenever we returned to America. We reviewed the most\noffensive rap lyrics from the Notorious B.I.G.’s recent album, and we talked\nabout what the Notorious B.I.G. would do on a train like this, and how his\nreaction would be distinct from that of Snoop Doggy Dogg. Neither of the\n\nrappers would like the train very much, we decided. At least ten times an\nhour I looked at my watch.\nI rarely glanced out the windows, and I couldn’t read. Sometimes I\nlistened to my Walkman, but I hadn’t brought enough tapes. Mostly I was too\nexhausted to speak Chinese, although in the afternoon I had a long\nconversation with a group of students who were on their way to Chengdu.\nBut that was a very calculated effort; I figured that if they realized we were\nteachers they might share their seats, out of respect. Sure enough, after thirty\nminutes’ conversation they kindly offered us a spot on the end of their bench.\nFor the second night Weiss and I shared the seat in shifts, one standing while\nthe other sat, but the seat wasn’t comfortable and neither of us slept for more\nthan ten minutes at a stretch.\nTime crept, especially when I was standing, and to pass the evening I did\nsomething that I often did in China when things got rough. I remembered\nother places I had visited, thinking about what I had liked the most about\nthem—a comfortable hotel, or a good restaurant, or the way a river wound\nthrough a green valley. I spent some time thinking about which part of the\nworld was the perfect opposite of this particular Chinese train, and at last I\ndecided that it was Switzerland. To distract myself I recalled some of the long\nhikes I had taken there, and in my mind I walked them over again. I\nremembered a certain stretch of the Swiss Valais where I had hiked up hard\nfrom the Val d’Anniviers, because night had been falling, and I remembered\ncamping high above St. Luc. My clothes were damp with the effort of the\nclimb, and I put the tent up quickly, because it was growing cold; and then I\nwent to sleep.\nThe next morning I climbed the Bella Tola. It was early summer and the\nmountain was still snow-covered, and the ice was streaked red with Sahara\nsand that had been blown across the Mediterranean by the föhn winds. After\nthe Bella Tola, I continued over the Meidpass into the Turtmanntal, which is\nthe first German-speaking valley as you head east across the southern Valais.\nThe Turtmanntal is a steep empty valley with a blue glacier trembling at its\nsouthern end, and I made camp in a meadow midway up the slope to the next\npass. I arranged everything carefully, checking my tent and sleeping bag, and\nthen I went to sleep. Always I went to sleep.\nThe train rocked east and south. By the last day it was as if something\ninside of me had snapped and I was too tired to do any more walks in my\n\nmind, not even short ones around my home in Missouri. Passengers started\ngetting off after we reached Sichuan, and for the last five hours Weiss and I\nhad seats. But it was too late to do us much good and we stared ahead without\nspeaking. We reached Chengdu in early evening, and I realized that I had just\nspent two days of my life standing on a train. My summer vacation was over.\nDuring the rest of my time in the Peace Corps, I never rode another train.\n\nTHE PRIEST\nIN THE OLD SECTION of Fuling City is a Catholic church, and in the\ncourtyard of the church is a propaganda sign, which consists of four lines of\nfour characters each:\nLove the Country, Love the Religion\nRespect God, Love the People\nThrow Your Body into the Four Modernizations\nServe the Masses\nThe Four Modernizations are Industry, Agriculture, Defense, and\nScience; and it is difficult to see their connection to Fuling’s Catholic church,\nwhich was constructed by French missionaries in 1861, and whose Masses\nare served by Father Li Hairou, who at eighty-three years of age is more than\nfour times as old as the Four Modernizations.\nFather Li stands well under five feet tall. Usually he wears a soft black\nberet atop his white-haired head. He has a long, proud nose—an Italian nose\nfor a Chinese Roman Catholic priest. His eyes are black, and sometimes they\nflicker and flash and show emotion when his voice, which is low and raspy,\ndoes not. Visitors occasionally remark on his brilliant white teeth, and Father\nLi responds by saying that they are a species of Modernization that cost him\ntwo hundred yuan and two months of eating nothing but rice gruel. He smiles\neasily. He walks with a dragon-headed cane. His kidneys often hurt, as does\nhis knee, and when these problems flare up he says the Mass in Latin,\nbecause it is quicker that way. If the pain is serious he does not say the Mass\nat all, but that rarely happens. He is strong, although he moves slowly, and\nthere is a pronounced dignity in his carriage. Most elderly people in China\n\nhave this dignity, because they live in a culture where age commands\nunquestioned respect; and many of them, like Father Li, have an extra sense\nof pride that comes from not only the years but the bitter way so many of\nthem passed. Those bitter years are what lie behind the flash in his eyes.\nFor more than half a century, Father Li has been a priest in Fuling.\nAnywhere in the world that is a long time to be a priest. In Fuling, fifty years\nof priesthood is an eternity.\nLI HAIROU’S GREAT-GRANDFATHER was converted to Catholicism\nby French missionaries in the early 1800s. The Li family lived in Dazu, not\nfar from Chongqing, and Li Hairou was the second son of a shopkeeper. At\neleven he was sent to a French-run parochial school in Chongqing, and then\nin Chengdu he studied to be a priest. He learned French and Latin, and, like\nthe other young seminary students, he dreamed of studying in Rome. Others\nwere sent to Italy, but Li Hairou stayed, becoming a priest in 1944, at the age\nof twenty-nine. Three years later, he was sent to Fuling—remote,\nundeveloped, a distant backwater of a poor province. Perhaps in another age\nit would have been a quiet post. But the midcentury was a time when nothing\nin China was quiet, when the War of Resistance Against the Japanese was\nfollowed by the Civil War and Communist Liberation, and these were\nstruggles that touched almost everybody in the Chongqing region. Li\nHairou’s older brother died during the wars, and his younger brother, having\nfound himself on the wrong side of Liberation, fled to Singapore, where he\nmarried and became a teacher. But Father Li stayed in Fuling, serving the\nthree thousand parishioners, working with the two French priests who lived\nin the area, waiting for the ripples of revolution to make their way down the\nYangtze Valley. And then the French were gone, and the ripples came to\nshore, and Father Li had to wait no more.\n“In the 1950s,” he says, “first there was trouble because Catholicism was\nconsidered Foreign Teaching. Later, during the Great Cultural Revolution,\nthere was more trouble because they were Destroying Superstition—but that\nwas later. At first they were trying to stop Foreign Teaching, and so after\nLiberation I was sent out to the countryside. That was in 1953. I was sent to\nthe north of Fuling, about seventy miles away. The conditions were terrible.\n\nOften there wasn’t enough to eat, and many people in China starved. That\nwas the time of the dagongfan—the communal meal. They had one pot, and\none person would put in some radishes, another person put in some rice,\nanother person put in some other vegetables. But there wasn’t enough for\neverybody to eat. It was the same with the Great Leap Forward—that was a\nhuge mistake. Those were both Chairman Mao’s ideas. He didn’t understand\neconomics the way Deng Xiaoping did. What Chairman Mao liked was\nrevolution; he liked struggle. People became poorer, and the poorer you were,\nthe more you were controlled.”\nFather Li is sitting in his office, a small dark room next to the church. As\nin so many Chinese sitting rooms, the decorations are a mystery of\nquirkiness: an empty aquarium, a plastic Donald Duck, a small statue of\nMary, a slightly smaller figure of Santa Claus, a talking digital clock that\nannounces the hour in Mandarin. But by far the strangest decoration, hanging\non the wall across from Father Li, is a large photograph of Mao Zedong and\nDeng Xiaoping.\nThe black-and-white picture features the two men smiling over cups of\ntea. The chairs of both men are reclined, and the scene would not be out of\nplace in a Sichuan teahouse. But the photograph is from near the end of\nMao’s life, when Deng Xiaoping had already suffered more than his share of\ntroubles from the old man’s policies, and undoubtedly there were emotions in\nthis meeting that the camera missed. And there are certainly feelings in\nFather Li’s heart that are not reflected in the simple and careful way that he\nspeaks about the past. But there is a spark in his eyes as he glances up at the\nphotograph, and then he shakes his head and continues his story.\n“In the countryside I didn’t have my vestments. I didn’t have a Bible. I\nhad nothing—all I had was a rosary, so I said the rosary three times a day. I\nreturned to Fuling in 1955, but I didn’t come back to the church, because it\nwas closed down. I couldn’t be a priest anymore, so I was sent down to work\non the docks. My job was cleaning—mopping, sweeping, cleaning the docks.\nI made twenty-four yuan a month. It wasn’t enough, you know.\n“Often I said Mass for myself. We weren’t allowed to have a church, but\nI could say Mass alone. But once the Great Cultural Revolution started, I\ncouldn’t even do that. The Red Guards turned the church into a sock factory,\nand they always watched me. I wasn’t in jail, but I was constantly guarded,\nand the Red Guards made me do many things. Often I wore the High Hat\n\nwhile they criticized me, and they’d force me to kneel down and bow like\nthis”—he dips his white head and gives a short laugh, the way he often\nchuckles when he remembers the Cultural Revolution. “They’d march me\nthrough the streets with a sign that said: ‘Down with Imperialism’s Faithful\nRunning Dogs!’ I’d wear the sign like this, in front and in back, with big\ncharacters on it.”\nHe traces the ten characters on the surface of the low table in front of\nhim, stroke by stroke, dipping a finger into his tea. This is a common Chinese\nhabit when speaking with foreigners—because many characters have the\nsame sound, a conversation will sometimes pause as the speaker writes a\nword in order to clarify the meaning for the waiguoren listener. They write\nthem in the air, on the palm of their hand, in tea water on a table; and to\nwatch a Chinese person do this is to realize how unique the written language\nis, and how its words are truly shapes—not just sounds, or collections of\nletters, but tangible things that are handled and touched. And in this case the\nwords are so tangible that they were once worn in public. But Father Li says\nnothing more about that; he merely traces his ten characters on the table, and\nthe hot water steams and evaporates, and the words disappear.\n“For three years it was particularly bad,” he says. “Especially for three\nmonths. During those three months, I had four Red Guards watching me all\nday, and five times each day they took me out on the street for\ndemonstrations.”\nHis visitor asks what year that was, and Father Li pauses, muttering softly\nas he stares into space. But the date will not come to him, and at last he\nshakes his head. “I can’t remember for certain,” he says. “But that was the\nworst time. During the struggle sessions, the Red Guards used to throw things\nat me—fruit, or other hard things. All of them were students—they were\nchildren. They thought it was fun.”\nHe is not smiling now. Something in his eyes has hardened, and he points\nup at the picture of Mao. “It was his idea,” Father Li says. “His mistake.\nWhen Deng Xiaoping came to power it was different, but during the Great\nCultural Revolution it was terrible. I was never injured very badly—that\nwasn’t the problem. The problem was that I didn’t get much to eat. Every day\nthey gave me only two bowls of rice gruel. Many priests in China died during\nthat time. Most of them died because they got sick; we didn’t have enough to\neat, and all day long we couldn’t rest. In Chongqing there were many who\n\ndied.”\nAgain he pauses to count, but this time the number comes to mind easily.\nHe is thinking of old friends, men he studied with, prayed with, and suffered\nwith, and because of that his memory is clear. But still there is a long pause\nbefore he responds. Perhaps in his mind he sees their faces, the way they died\nand the way he nearly died. His eyes are distant as he remembers, and then he\nspeaks again.\n“Six,” he says. “In Chongqing there were six priests who died.”\nBUT FATHER LI is not a bitter man, which is probably why he has lived so\nlong. He does not complain about today’s Communist Party, and he seems\nsincere when he says that its policies are fine; indeed, things are infinitely\nbetter than they once were. The church is in reasonably good repair, and it is\ngranted tax-free status by the government, which also provides Father Li with\na living stipend of two hundred yuan a month. The priest is allowed to say\nMass again, and his parishioners can attend without harassment. Weekday\nservices are in Latin while Sunday Mass is in the dialect.\nOn the average Sunday there are about fifty worshipers, mostly women,\nall elderly. Rarely is there anybody under forty years of age. There are no\nweddings or baptisms in the church—only funerals.\nThere are, of course, plenty of rules. Missionary work is illegal in China,\nand official connections to Rome are not allowed—a point of contention that,\nhaving strained relations between China and the Vatican for five centuries, is\nunlikely to be resolved easily.\n“We can recognize the Pope personally,” explains Father Li. “In our\nminds, in our faith, we can recognize him. If we didn’t recognize him, how\ncould you call us Catholic? Every day we pray to him. But there’s no\neconomic guanxi with Rome—they don’t give us money. And also there’s no\npolitical connection with them, and the Pope can’t come to China. He would\nlike to come but he can’t, because right now he recognizes Taiwan. If he\nrecognized China instead, then he could come. But even now there are priests\nin China who have visited Rome to see him. This year the Pope went to\nCuba, and it had been many years since he had last been there. That visit\nwent very well, too. So maybe in the future he’ll also make it to China.”\n\nThese are distant issues, and Father Li seems far more concerned about\nthe problems he faces here in Fuling. He worries about his aging\nparishioners, and he worries about the serious shortage of clergy in Sichuan,\nwhich has but seventy priests for 120 churches. He also worries about money,\nbecause his parishioners are too poor to give much support, and foreign\nassistance has diminished since his younger brother died in Singapore five\nyears ago.\nBut he doesn’t worry too much, because such concerns seem minor\ncompared to everything that he has seen in the past. He has seen the War of\nResistance Against the Japanese, the Civil War, and Liberation. He has seen,\npersonally, the campaign against Foreign Teaching and the campaign to\nDestroy Superstition. He has seen the old French-built church turned into a\nsock factory. He has seen ugly words draped over his shoulders. He has seen\nthe church reopen back in 1981, and on the first Sunday he saw fewer than\ntwenty nervous people come to Mass. Now the Fuling area has more than a\nthousand Catholics, even if rarely there are more than fifty at a given service,\nand for an old priest like Father Li there is a great deal of satisfaction in\nseeing that much. Others weren’t so fortunate.\nBut still it seems strange that in his office he can look up and see the\nphotograph of Mao Zedong, who made a three-decade hole in Father Li’s life\nas a priest. It is not uncommon for Sichuanese victims of the Cultural\nRevolution to have a poster of Deng Xiaoping on their walls, because he\nsuffered as they did, but very few of them display pictures of Mao. Perhaps\nfor Father Li there is a political reason—maybe he does it to appease cadres,\nthe way somebody is appeased by the Four Modernizations sign in the\ncourtyard. In China, many officials see religion as subversive, particularly the\nCatholic Church, and perhaps the photograph is intended to put their minds at\nrest.\nFather Li often looks at the picture. While talking about the trials of the\npast, he glances at it repeatedly, and every time there is the sudden flash in\nhis eyes, as if something about the photograph holds his memories together.\nAt the end of his story, he looks at it once more. Again he points a steady\nfinger at Mao.\n“All of that was his idea,” he says. He pauses, still staring at the picture,\nwhose smiling figures give no sense of what “all of that” entails: the broken\nchurch, the cruel and violent children with their red armbands, the lost years\n\nand the lost friends. Then the priest says, simply, “Because of that, we don’t\nrespect him.”\n\nCHAPTER EIGHT\n\nChinese Life\nON SUNDAY MORNINGS in Fuling I went to eight-o’clock Mass. I had\ngone to Mass alone during the spring of my first year, but now in the fall I\nwent with Noreen Finnegan, who was one of the new Peace Corps volunteers\nsent to Fuling. There were two of them—Noreen and Sunni Fass. It felt\nstrange to have suddenly doubled the population of waiguoren, and neither\nAdam nor I knew exactly what to think about the change. We were\ncomfortable with our routines of the first year, and our relationship had\nalways been easy—we were very close, but at the same time we had always\nbeen able to spend time apart. There were sections of the city and the college\nthat each of us had carved out for himself, and we didn’t interfere with each\nother’s routines.\nIn a small place like Fuling it doesn’t take long to feel possessive about\nthe city. Neither Adam nor I had ever seen another waiguoren there, apart\nfrom friends who had come to visit us, and our contact with the Peace Corps\nwas minimal. Two administrators had made visits during our first month of\nservice, but after that we were left alone. Fuling was far from the Peace Corps\nheadquarters in Chengdu, and none of the administrators liked taking the\nYangtze boats, which were slow and dangerous. Back in the spring, two of\nthe Fuling boats had collided near Chongqing in a particularly bad accident,\nkilling more than a dozen people, and several times on the river I saw\nabandoned boats that were in various stages of sinking. I was always careful\nto pass these stories along to the Peace Corps, so they’d be less inclined to\nvisit. It was simplest if we were left alone, and for the most part we were.\nBut now there were four of us, and for a while I worried about the\nchange. In the end, though, it didn’t have much of an effect. Life was slightly\ndifferent in the college, but the city was big enough to swallow four\nwaiguoren without any trouble. And for the first semester Noreen and Sunni\nwere very similar to Adam and me at the beginning; they were shell-shocked\n\nby the pressures of downtown Fuling, and neither of them spent much time\naway from campus.\nNoreen’s parents had immigrated to New York City from Ireland, which\nwas one reason she went to Mass on Sundays. When she first mentioned that\nher father had been an Irish potato farmer, Mr. Wang, who was the waiban\nrepresentative, became very excited. “So your father was a peasant!” he said.\nNoreen didn’t know what to think about that. “Well,” she said, “he was a\nfarmer in Ireland.”\n“But you said he was poor, right?”\n“Well, yes.”\n“So he was a peasant!”\n“Uhm, I guess.”\n“My parents were also peasants! Most of your students in this college are\npeasants!”\nNoreen knew little about class background in China, and she asked me\nhow one should react when people said your father was a peasant. But in\nChinese there isn’t really a word for farmer—people who worked the land are\nnongmin, literally “agricultural people,” and in English it is usually translated\nas “peasant.” In some ways this is an inaccurate translation, calling to mind\nfeudal Europe, but also a term like “farmer” fails to convey the negative\nconnotations that are associated with working the land in China. Roughly 75\npercent of the population is involved in agriculture, and the divide between\nthese people and the urban Chinese is one of the most striking gaps in the\ncountry. City dwellers in a place like Fuling can recognize a peasant at a\nsingle glance, and often they are victims of prejudice and condescension.\nEven the world for soil—tu—can be applied to people as a derogatory\nadjective, meaning unrefined and uncouth.\nBut so many of our students were from rural families that these\nprejudices weren’t strong on campus. In a class of forty-five there were\nusually fewer than ten who had grown up in any sort of small city, and these\ncities tended to be even more remote than Fuling. Very few of the students\nhad much money, which meant that it was rare to see either the snobbishness\nof privilege or the sensitivity of coming from a lower-class background.\nWhen I asked my students what their parents did for a living, almost always\nthey responded, in English, “My mother and father are peasants.”\nAt the beginning these responses embarrassed me, because the students\n\nused this feudal word in such a matter-of-fact way. Once I asked a freshman\nabout his family, and he said, “My father is a peasant, and my mother is a\nsweeper.”\n“I’m sorry, I didn’t understand. What does your mother do?”\n“She is a sweeper.”\n“A sweeper?”\n“Yes. She sweeps the streets.”\nHe said it without any self-consciousness, the same way that all of them\ndescribed their backgrounds. I told Noreen that she should be proud to be the\ndaughter of an Irish peasant—of all the Fuling waiguoren, she had the most\nrevolutionary class origins.\nNoreen and I went to church on Sundays, which was one of my favorite\nroutines in Fuling, because I liked watching the priest and the old women\nwho went there every week. They were survivors—there was a quiet strength\nto the congregation, and they had none of the well-dressed smugness of\nAmerican churchgoers. All of them had paid for their faith, in ways that\nmoney could not measure, and Father Li had paid the most of all.\nWatching the priest also made me remember my mother’s father, who\nhad been a Benedictine monk. He had grown up in Arkansas, where his\nparish sometimes awarded promising students with scholarships to Italy, and\nin 1929 my grandfather was sent to San Anselmo Abbey in Rome. He was\neighteen years old, and his plan was to become a priest and perhaps a\nmissionary.\nI had read his diary from those years and it was full of homesickness, but\nit was also full of the beauty and wonder of Rome, the stunning churches and\nthe history that caught the young man’s eyes everywhere he turned in the\ncity. He was in the middle of that history, too; often his diary mentioned\nnationalistic rallies in the streets, and a few times he caught sight of\nMussolini at parades.\nIn the spring of 1931, a group of priests returned to the abbey from\nCatholic University in Beijing. On March 1 of 1931, my grandfather’s diary\nreads, in neat black script:\nA bunch of us Americans visit Fr. Sylvester Healy in his room this\nmorning, and have a long talk about China in general and the Catholic\n\nUniversity of Peking in particular. Fr. Healy made his Solemn\nProfession this morning in the College Church. He seems very\noptimistic about the future of the Catholic University and to have given\nhimself wholeheartedly to the work.\nAfter that day, the diary changes. There is less of Rome and more of\nChina; the fascination grows quickly, until “China” is capitalized and\nunderlined, a sacred word:\nMarch, 18, 1931: Fr. Francis Clougherty, Chancellor of the Catholic\nUniversity of Peking, arrives here to-day on his way back to China. A\nbig strapping Irishman.\nMarch 22, 1931: Fr. Clougherty holds an informal “at home” this\nmorning and about 15 of us troop up to his room. Of course there are\nsmokes and a general spirit of congeniality. Fr. Clougherty is very\ninteresting to listen to. According to him the University is now on a\nperfectly solid foundation and he has received promises to come out to\nChina from a considerable [number] of very capable teachers, both\nBenedictine and otherwise.\nMarch 23, 1931: All small talk among Americans is about China\nnow.\nMarch 25, 1931: Talk to Raph and Donald about China upon my\nreturn. Fr. Clougherty had a big day to-day but comes down to Donald’s\nroom and gives Donald, Hugh, Edward and me an inspiring talk. We are\nso wrought up that when Clougherty leaves at 12 o’clock Donald, H.,\n\nand I stay up and talk it over till almost 3 A.M. I believe that this is the\nturning point in my life and I am going to sign up for China. God be\nwith us!\nMarch 26, 1931: CHINA! Get up rather late this morning after last\nnight. Spend most of the morning in Donald’s room discussing China.\nFr. Clougherty comes down and brings pictures of the statues about\nwhich he spoke last night. It seems there will be quite a little colony of\nAmericans emigrating from San Anselmo, Rome, to Catholic\nUniversity, Peking. Deo Volente, I am one of them.\nMarch 27, 1931: Everything is China at present. I breathe, eat and\nsleep China and I think that is about the case with all of our “China\ngroup.”\nAs my grandfather came closer to taking his vows of priesthood, his\nsuperior informed him that he would be sent back to Arkansas. My\ngrandfather responded with a long letter explaining that deep in his soul he\nhad a call from God to serve in China. But his superior countered by saying\nthat sometimes this is how God works—occasionally He gives a young man a\nfalse call, simply to test his loyalty to his earthly superior, and sometimes you\nfeel truly that you are meant to go to China when in fact you are intended to\ngo to Arkansas.\nAnd so passed the turning point of my grandfather’s life. He did not want\nto be a priest in Arkansas, and the Benedictines did not want him to be a\npriest in China; and thus he left the order and returned to America. He sold\ninsurance. He married. He had children, grandchildren. He retired, played\ngolf, traveled. On Sundays he always went to Mass. He never did go to\nChina. He didn’t talk much about his time as a monk, and I never knew about\nhis interest in China until I came across his diaries as a graduate student. But\nby then it had been seven years since he had died in 1987, when I was\n\nseventeen years old—nearly the same age as the young monk in Rome and,\nlike him, too young to have any sense of time, of what the future might hold\nand how the past might reappear.\nI CONTINUED WITH MY CHINESE TUTORIALS in Fuling,\nalternating between Teacher Kong and Teacher Liao. We always started\nclasses with small talk, and often Teacher Liao told me about what she had\nwatched on television the night before. Like most of my friends in Fuling, she\nwatched an enormous amount of television, and one day she came to class\nparticularly interested in what she had seen.\n“Last night there was a waiguoren on television,” she said, “He was\nspeaking Chinese.”\n“Was it Da Shan?”\n“No, it wasn’t Da Shan; his Chinese wasn’t nearly as good as Da Shan’s.\nHis Chinese wasn’t as good as yours.”\n“That can’t be true.”\n“Actually, his grammar was better than yours, but his pronunciation was\nworse. His tones were bad.”\n“I don’t believe it.”\n“I’m not kidding,” she said. “I think your Chinese is better than that of\nthe waiguoren who was on television. And if you improved your grammar, it\nwould be much better.”\n“Where was he from?”\n“Australia. He was very ugly—he had bad skin and very long hair. He\nwas extremely hard to look at.”\nFor a moment we sat there, silent in our shared distaste for the longhaired\nwaiguoren with bad tones on television. Then we started class, and Teacher\nLiao paid particularly close attention to my grammar.\nAfter that she kept me updated on the waiguoren who appeared on\ntelevision. For the most part it was a small and select group, with Da Shan as\nthe mainstay, and all of the regulars were very good at Chinese—it was clear\nthat I still had years to go before I could enter that league. But Teacher Liao\napparently felt that there was hope, and occasionally a waiguoren with tone\nproblems would appear and she would criticize him mercilessly. Always she\n\nwas careful to point out any physical defects or shortcomings, especially if\nthe waiguoren was fat. Teacher Liao was an extremely slender woman and\nshe did not like fat waiguoren.\nThere was still a certain formality to our relationship, but it had become a\ncomfortable formality—the Chinese relationship between a teacher and a\nstudent. She took pride in my progress, and now that I was starting to read\nnewspapers she carefully reviewed the Chongqing Evening Times and clipped\narticles that we could use in class. She liked clipping stories about the\nJapanese atrocities of World War II, and she also liked stories about Hong\nKong’s improvements since its return to the Motherland (great things had\nhappened in those three months). Occasionally she could not help but select\narticles that criticized America’s imperialist tendencies. In late September,\nwhen France complained about American sanctions of Iran, our tutorials\nconsisted of a slew of stories condemning America’s role as “the policeman\nof the world.” But even in those classes there was no tension; our Opium\nWars were long finished, and we had learned how to deal with each other.\nBoth of us had changed, but probably I had changed the most: I was no\nlonger strictly a waiguoren, neither in her eyes nor in my own.\nI liked Teacher Liao because now I could see that she was a very\ntraditional Chinese woman—in my mind, she was the most Chinese person I\never came to know in Fuling. She refused to allow a waiguoren to\ncondescend to her, because she was a fiercely proud woman, but at the same\ntime she was capable of extending this pride to me after months of work.\nAlong with her pride, she had a strong sense of propriety and tradition. She\ndidn’t dress in revealing clothes like many other young women did, and she\ndidn’t Westernize her hair by dyeing. Unlike Teacher Kong, she refused to\nhave our classes in my apartment. Teacher Liao was a married woman and I\nwas a single man, and people might talk if she spent six hours a week in my\nhome. We always met in my office.\nI also liked studying with Teacher Liao because I could get some sense of\nthe prevailing Chinese attitude to nearly any issue by simply asking her,\nbecause she was so Chinese, and often I used our classes to untangle things\nthat I had seen or heard in my encounters with other people. For a while I was\nintrigued by the Chinese fascination with Hitler—if you ever talked with Old\nHundred Names about the Führer, they generally gave good reviews. The\nsummer before in Xi’an, I had known a German student who was disturbed\n\nby the way many Chinese became excited when they discovered her\nnationality.\n“Oh, you’re from Germany!” they would say. “Xitele—Hitler! Very\ngood!”\nOut of curiosity I often asked the Chinese about him, and many people\nsaid the same thing—that he had made some mistakes, but he had been a\ngreat leader who did some fine things for his country. It seemed natural\nenough that Chairman Mao had left the Chinese with a certain appetite for\ndictators, but I was still curious, and I asked Teacher Liao why the Chinese\nwere so positive about Hitler. As usual, she was extremely helpful. She said\nthat for years Charlie Chaplin’s The Great Dictator had been seen in theaters\nand on television; everybody in China had watched it.\n“Have you seen it?” I asked.\n“Certainly!”\n“How many times?”\nShe paused and counted in her head. “Four, I think,” she said. “Maybe\nmore.”\n“What’s it like?”\n“It’s very wonderful! I always liked the way Hitler talks in the movie,\nlike a crazy man. He’s like this”—and she imitated Charlie Chaplin imitating\nHitler; she raised her shoulders and shook her fist, chin in the air.\n“Wah wah wah wah wah!” she shouted, as if giving a speech in a foreign\nlanguage, and then she collapsed into giggles.\n“But doesn’t that movie make fun of Hitler?” I asked.\n“Of course!”\n“So why is it that so many Chinese people tell me that there are some\ngood things about him?”\n“Most of us have two contrary ideas—that Hitler was a great leader, and\nthat he was a crazy man who did terrible things. We have both of these ideas\nat once, you see. And I think people believe that he is an interesting\ncharacter, and that also makes them like him. He’s very interesting to watch.”\nPerhaps the strangest part of the Chinese fascination with Hitler was that\nsimultaneously they had a deep respect for the Jewish people. Jews were the\nnext best thing to the Chinese—they were an extremely intelligent race, as\none could tell from the examples of Einstein and Marx. In Xi’an, I had\nstudied with an Israeli student, and the teachers and workers had made an\n\nenormous fuss over him. Everybody was very impressed by his intelligence,\ndespite the fact that he was not particularly bright and a horrible student of\nChinese. But he was Jewish, and all Jews were intelligent; everybody knew\nthat and so they overlooked the reality of his particular case. It was the same\nas my blue eyes.\nIdeas of this sort were standard and completely predictable, and the\nlonger I lived in China the more I realized that in this sense the country\nwasn’t as complicated as outsiders often said. Foreigners always talked about\nhow difficult it was to understand China, and often this was true, but there\nwere also many ways in which the people’s ideas were remarkably uniform\nand predictable. There were buttons that you could push—Hitler, Jews, the\nJapanese, the Opium Wars, Tibetans, Taiwan—and 90 percent of the time\nyou could predict the precise reaction, including specific phrases that people\nwould use. It was natural enough, given China’s conditions: virtually\neverybody was the same race, the country had been isolated for centuries, and\nthe current education system was strictly standardized and politically\ncontrolled.\nAnd it was also natural that these conditions resulted in some particularly\nbizarre notions, like the admiration of Hitler or the fascination with Thai\ntransvestites. This was something else I had realized over the summer: if you\nasked random Chinese people about Thailand, virtually all of them would say\nthe exact same thing, that the Thais are famous for their renyao, or\ntransvestites.\nIt was interesting to figure out these common beliefs, and occasionally\nyou could work them to your advantage. During the summer, my sister\nAngela and Todd, her Stanford colleague, had been bored by eating meals\nwith their Chinese interpreter, so I gave them a list of subjects that would\nsurely make things more entertaining. Todd was Jewish, and I told him that\nthis was a trump card that should not be wasted. After I left, he broke the\nmonotony of a meal by announcing his ethnic background.\n“You are Jewish?” the interpreter said, eyes wide.\n“Yes.”\n“You must be very clever!”\nAfter that, he treated Todd with new respect. It had been the same way\nwith a teacher in the second Peace Corps group; everything changed once the\npeople discovered that she was Jewish. One of her Chinese friends\n\napologized to her, because before the revelation the friend had not treated her\nwith the appropriate respect that should be accorded a Jew.\nOnce during the summer I had studied my Chinese textbook while riding\na train, which impressed the other passengers. As a waiguoren it was never\nhard to impress—even the most pathetic command of the Chinese language\nmade the people respect you. But on that train there was one woman who\nstudied me with particular interest.\n“You are a Zhongguotong,” she said. “A China hand. I can see that you\nstudy very diligently.”\n“That’s not true,” I said. “If I studied diligently my Chinese would be\nbetter.”\nShe peered at me, and it was clear that she was thinking hard about\nsomething. “Are you Jewish?” she finally asked.\n“No,” I said, and something in her expression made me want to\napologize. But I suppressed the urge, and we talked for a while longer. I\nsensed her disappointment as she returned to her berth, but there was nothing\nto do about that: I was just another waiguoren, and not a Jew at all.\nEVERYTHING IN FULING was new that second year. I had new students\n—all of last year’s seniors had graduated, and most of them were teaching in\nthe countryside. My own Chinese tutors were as good as new; they were real\npeople now, and we could talk comfortably about anything. The city didn’t\nseem as dirty and loud as last year, and the people were friendlier. When they\nspoke, it made sense. The only thing that hadn’t changed was my job; I still\ntaught literature, but now it was easier because I had last year’s notes. I spent\nmost of my spare time in the city, wandering around and talking to people.\nI had city routines for every day of the week, every time of the day.\nSometimes in the mornings I went down to South Mountain Gate and sat in\nthe park, watching the city come to life. Tuesday afternoons I talked to the\nphotographer and went to Wangzhou Park. Monday evenings I walked along\nthe busy streets of Mid-Mountain Road. On Sundays, I went to church, and\nafterward I sat and talked with Father Li, who served me bad coffee. I did not\nlike good coffee but I drank the priest’s coffee out of respect, just as he\nserved it to me out of respect for the waiguoren tendency to prefer coffee to\n\ntea.\nAfter talking with Father Li, I would wander through the old city and\nwatch the blacksmiths at work near the river. Then I would walk up to the\nteahouse in the middle of town, because on Sundays a group of middle-aged\nand older men brought their pet birds there, hanging the cages from the\nrafters. They were always happy to see me, especially Zhang Xiaolong, who\nwas the Luckiest Man in All of Fuling. Ten years ago he had been injured in\na motorcycle accident, shortening one leg, and now he walked with a limp. It\nwas a wonderful injury because it meant that he was officially classified as\ndisabled, and thus he could never be fired from his job at the Hailing factory.\nIt was a state-owned enterprise, and reforms were leading to layoffs, but none\nof this concerned Zhang Xiaolong, whose job was completely secure. It was\nmore luck than one could expect from a motorcycle accident, but Zhang\nXiaolong had beaten the odds again when his wife became pregnant and gave\nbirth—not to a daughter, or to a son, but to twin sons. To be slightly but\ncertifiably disabled, and to have twin sons—that was fantasy; it didn’t happen\nin real life; people wrote books about good fortune of that sort.\nEvery Sunday, Zhang Xiaolong limped proudly to the teahouse, carrying\nhis birdcage, and he sat beaming in the sunshine as he drank his tea. He was\nthe Happiest Man in All of Fuling, as well as the Luckiest, and I liked talking\nwith him—not because he was particularly interesting, but simply because he\nwas always pleasant. And he reminded me that my own life in Fuling was\nalso charmed. Almost everywhere I went, people knew who I was, and I\ncould follow my routines and be assured that the regulars would be happy to\nsee me. There were still plenty of young men who shouted a mocking “Hah-\nloooo!” when I walked down the street, but it was less of a problem than last\nyear, and in any case the harassment was drowned out by the kindness of\nmost people. It was the same paradox that I had realized during the summer\n—the Chinese could be hard on foreigners, but at the same time they could be\nincredibly patient, generous, and curious about where you had come from. I\nfelt I had spent my first year coping with the hard part of being a waiguoren,\nand now I enjoyed all the benefits.\nIn many ways the city had turned full circle for me, but of course I was\nthe one who had really changed. I was a new person, He Wei, or, as the\nSichuanese pronounced it, Ho Wei. That was the name I had been given\nduring Peace Corps training, and it was common in China: the given name,\n\nWei, meant “great” and was as run-of-the-mill as John in America. The\nfamily name was also prevalent; there were plenty of Hos wherever I went in\nSichuan, and when I introduced myself they always said that we were\njiamenr, family. There was even another Ho Wei at the college, who taught\nin the physical education department.\nIt was different from living in most countries, where you could use your\nreal name or something similar to it, which was a clear link to who you had\noriginally been. My Chinese name had no connection to my American name,\nand the person who became Ho Wei had no real connection to my American\nself. There was an enormous freedom in that—at the age of twenty-eight, I\nsuddenly had a completely new identity.\nAnd you could tinker with that identity, starting with changing your name\nitself. Adam had done this at the end of our first year, because his original\nname, Mei Erkang, sounded too much like a foreigner’s name (it also\nsounded a lot like a popular Sichuanese brand of pig feed). Looking for\nsomething that was more authentically Chinese and less agricultural, Adam\nasked his students to propose new names, complete with explanations, and\nafter several rounds they came up with Mei Zhiyuan. The given name,\nZhiyuan, meant “Motivated by Lofty Goals,” and it was shared by Ma\nZhiyuan, a Yuan Dynasty poet who seven centuries ago had written a famous\nverse on homesickness. Virtually all educated Chinese recognized the\nallusion, and there were subsequent writers who had used the two characters\nin other poems. Suddenly, Adam went from pig feed to a noble-sounding\nclassical allusion—that was how easily a waiguoren could redefine himself in\nChina.\nI never changed my Chinese name, but I sensed the ease with which my\nChinese identity became distinct from my American self. Eventually, I came\nto think of myself as two people, Ho Wei and Peter Hessler. Ho Wei wasn’t\nreally a person until my second year in Fuling, but as time passed I realized\nthat he was becoming most of my identity: apart from my students,\ncolleagues, and the other foreigners, everybody knew me strictly as Ho Wei,\nand they knew me strictly in Chinese. Ho Wei was completely different from\nmy American self: he was friendlier, he was eager to talk with anybody, and\nhe took great pleasure in even the most inane conversations. In a simple way\nhe was funny; by saying a few words in the local dialect he could be\nendlessly entertaining to the people in Fuling. Also Ho Wei was stupid,\n\nwhich was what I liked the most about him. He spoke with an accent; he had\nlousy grammar; and he laughed at the simple mistakes that he made. People\nwere comfortable with somebody that stupid, and they found it easy to talk\nwith Ho Wei, even though they often had to say things twice or write new\nwords in his notebook. Ho Wei always carried his notebook in his pocket,\nusing it to study the new words, as well as to jot down notes from\nconversations. And when Ho Wei returned home he left the notebook on the\ndesk of Peter Hessler, who typed everything into his computer.\nI had two desks in my apartment. One was for studying Chinese, and the\nother was for writing; one desk was Ho Wei’s and the other belonged to Peter\nHessler. Sometimes this relationship unnerved me—it seemed wrong that\nbehind Ho Wei’s stupidity there was another person watching everything\nintently and taking notes. But I could think of no easy resolution to this\ndivide; I had my Chinese life and my American life, and even if they\noccupied similar territory, they were completely different. My apartment was\nbig and I kept the desks in separate rooms. Ho Wei and Peter Hessler never\nmet each other. The notebook was the only thing they truly shared.\nONE SUNDAY there was a funeral at the church. Noreen was sick that day\nand I sat alone, trying to follow the service in my missal. I always liked doing\nthat, because it was good Chinese practice and it reminded me of boyhood,\nwhen some of my earliest reading had been done during Mass.\nPeople milled around the courtyard after the service and I could see that it\nwas a special event. Father Li and I sat in the rectory, where he called for\ncoffee and cookies, and one of the old women who lived there brought them\non a tray. The coffee was even worse than usual. I thanked the woman and\ndrank as much as I could bear, eating cookies to dull the taste. Father Li and I\nasked about each other’s health, and then he mentioned that today’s service\nhad been a funeral.\n“Oh, I’m very sorry,” I said. “Who was it for?”\nHe said a woman’s name that I didn’t recognize. “How old was she?” I\nasked.\n“Eighty years old.”\n“She had a very long life.”",

He holds a chopstick. He picks up a\nwrapper in one hand. With the chopstick he draws out a pinch of pork filling\nand places it in the square of dough. Then he dips the chopstick in the water,\nand uses it to fold the corners of the wrapper around the meat. The finished\ndumpling extends in two points, one crossing on top of the other. He drops\nthe dumpling into the pan.\nElsewhere in China this food is called hundun, but the Sichuanese have\ntheir own way of speaking, and they call it chaoshou—“crossed hands”—\nbecause of the way the corners of the dumpling overlap. In most parts of\nSichuan, you can walk into a restaurant and order chaoshou without making a\nsound. Cross your arms and they will understand exactly what you want.\nIt takes Huang Xiaoqiang less than five seconds to make the dumpling.\nHe picks up another wrapper, inserts the meat, wets the corners, folds them\nover, and drops the chaoshou into the pan. It looks exactly the same as the\nfirst one. He makes another, and then one more. Outside the sun is rising and\nthe minibuses are honking and the fruit women have set up their stands.\nOranges are in season. Huang Xiaoqiang makes more chaoshou. All of them\nare well-made and they look exactly alike."

One of my\ngraduated first-year students, Aumur, had taken a teaching job in Tibet,\nwhere the salary was one thousand yuan a month—more than twice what he\nwould have made in the countryside of Sichuan. But Aumur sent half of his\nTibet salary home to his parents, who were peasants, and yet there was not\nthe slightest sense of burden or regret that accompanied this generosity. “It’s\nmy duty,” he said simply, when I asked him about it, and he explained that\nthis was the only way that his younger brother could afford his school tuition\nfees. Aumur’s commitment in Tibet was eight years, and if he left early the\nfines were as high as twenty thousand yuan, but I never heard him complain\nabout the work he was doing to support his parents and brother.\nEverything had a price in Fuling, where fines were a common part of life.\nStudents were fined ten yuan if they failed an exam, two yuan for\nunsatisfactory cleaning of the classroom, and one and a half yuan for\nskipping morning exercises. I knew Peace Corps teachers at another Sichuan\ncollege where a student was fined five hundred yuan—enough money for two\nmonths’ expenses—for publicly holding hands with his girlfriend on campus\nwhile a government delegation was in town.\nAll of this was good preparation for adult life, which also had its share of"

My faith is the Communist\nParty. I first wanted to join when I was a college student, but at that time I\nwasn’t accepted.”\nTeacher Kong is a Party Member and a former peasant and a current\ninstructor of Ancient Chinese Literature in the Chinese department of Fuling\nTeachers College. He is thirty-three years old, and there are a few streaks of\nsilver in his black hair. He has a soft smile that is shadowed by the barest hint\nof a mustache on his upper lip. He knows a great deal about Han Dynasty\npoetry, and his three-year-old son has the given name Songtao, which means\n“waves of pines”: the sound a pine forest makes when the wind blows.\n“It’s a common phrase in Chinese poetry,” Teacher Kong explains. “It\nwas also used once by Shelley—I read it in translation.

            "THE TEACHER\n“EVERYBODY NEEDS SOME KIND OF FAITH,” says Kong Ming.\n“Whether it’s religion, or Capitalist Democracy, or Communism—regardless\nof what the faith is, everybody needs something. My faith is the Communist\nParty. I first wanted to join when I was a college student, but at that time I\nwasn’t accepted.”\nTeacher Kong is a Party Member and a former peasant and a current\ninstructor of Ancient Chinese Literature in the Chinese department of Fuling\nTeachers College. He is thirty-three years old, and there are a few streaks of\nsilver in his black hair. He has a soft smile that is shadowed by the barest hint\nof a mustache on his upper lip. He knows a great deal about Han Dynasty\npoetry, and his three-year-old son has the given name Songtao, which means\n“waves of pines”: the sound a pine forest makes when the wind blows.\n“It’s a common phrase in Chinese poetry,” Teacher Kong explains. “It\nwas also used once by Shelley—I read it in translation. There’s a poem he\nwrote about a forest, where he describes the trees making that same sound. I\nthink the forest was in Italy but I’m not certain.”\nThere are only 58 million Party Members in all of China—less than 5\npercent of the population.

It was a very remote area and the schools were honored to receive\nforeign guests; for two days we gave speeches and attended banquets, and we\nplayed in an exhibition basketball game.\nAdam and I had spent so much time together that we could give a good\njoint speech without a bit of planning; we knew how to play off each other\nand everything always went smoothly. We gave the Wulong speeches half in\nEnglish and half in Chinese, and mostly we tried to get the students excited,\nwhich wasn’t difficult. After every speech hundreds of them crowded around,\nasking for autographs, and we signed until finally the cadres dragged us off to\nsome other event. We were scheduled to give speeches and attend meetings\nfor virtually every hour that we were in Wulong.\nAfter two days of that we were completely exhausted. Often my days in\nSichuan ended like that, in absolute and total exhaustion. Part of it was that I\nwas usually sick—I had chronic sinus infections from the pollution, which\nfinally made me stop running, and my health was bad enough that I was\ninfected with tuberculosis during that year. By the time I left Fuling, my\nPeace Corps medical folder would be swollen with the illnesses and injuries\nof those two years: tuberculosis, amebic dysentery, chronic sinusitis, a broken\near drum, a broken nose (from basketball), one eye with dramatically reduced\neyesight (a mystery).\nThe climate wasn’t healthy, but mostly I was run down by the pressures\nof daily life as a waiguoren.

            "Chinese New Year\nAT THE END OF THE FALL SEMESTER, our third-year students went\noff to do their practice teaching. In December, Adam and I made a trip south\nto watch a couple of our favorite students teach; they were training at middle\nschools in Wulong, a town up the Wu River near the border with Guizhou\nprovince. It was a very remote area and the schools were honored to receive\nforeign guests; for two days we gave speeches and attended banquets, and we\nplayed in an exhibition basketball game.\nAdam and I had spent so much time together that we could give a good\njoint speech without a bit of planning; we knew how to play off each other\nand everything always went smoothly. We gave the Wulong speeches half in\nEnglish and half in Chinese, and mostly we tried to get the students excited,\nwhich wasn’t difficult. After every speech hundreds of them crowded around,\nasking for autographs, and we signed until finally the cadres dragged us off to\nsome other event. We were scheduled to give speeches and attend meetings\nfor virtually every hour that we were in Wulong.\nAfter two days of that we were completely exhausted. Often my days in\nSichuan ended like that, in absolute and total exhaustion. Part of it was that I\nwas usually sick—I had chronic sinus infections from the pollution, which\nfinally made me stop running, and my health was bad enough that I was\ninfected with tuberculosis during that year. By the time I left Fuling, my\nPeace Corps medical folder would be swollen with the illnesses and injuries\nof those two years: tuberculosis, amebic dysentery, chronic sinusitis, a broken\near drum, a broken nose (from basketball), one eye with dramatically reduced\neyesight (a mystery).\nThe climate wasn’t healthy, but mostly I was run down by the pressures\nof daily life as a waiguoren. It was tiring always to be the center of attention,\nand being a foreigner meant that you were more likely to attract\ncomplications. Often there was some minor crisis or issue that demanded my"

She loved the way that I always\nreferred to myself as “the foreign devil,” and she also thought it was funny\nthat Adam and I lied constantly about each other and the new volunteers.\nBack in the fall we had told Wang Chaosu that she could charge Sunni and\nNoreen five times the normal price for noodles, and in return for half of that\nwe wouldn’t tell them they were being cheated.\n“That’s not polite,” she said, shocked. “They just arrived and we\nshouldn’t cheat them.”\n“Who cares?” I said. “They’re just foreign devils! And they have so much\nmoney—both of them are very rich.”\n“You’re lying! I know you’re lying! Next time I’ll cheat you!” That was a\nconstant joke between us—every time we came to the restaurant she talked"

Little Wang hung behind, playing with the gun.\n“Can I borrow this?” he finally asked.\nThe last time I had seen Little Wang, he had been particularly well\narmed, and I asked him what had happened.\n“I lost all my guns,” he said. “I don’t know where they are.”\nI looked carefully at the boy and saw that he was lying. “Did your family\ntake them away? Tell me the truth.”\nHe stood there staring at his feet, silent.\n“Did you hurt somebody else?”\n“No,” he said. But it wasn’t a very firm reply and he hung his head. He\nfingered the plastic barrel of the gun."

        "“Yes,” the priest said. “And she was very good for our church. She was\nhere every Sunday.”\n“What was her job?”\n“She was retired, of course. But before that she worked at the Hailing\nfactory.”\nThere was a small number of parishioners who went to Mass every week,\nand I asked some more questions to see if I could remember the woman.\nFather Li answered patiently, and then finally he pointed behind me and said,\n“She’s right there.”\nI turned around and saw the woman laid out ten feet behind me, on a\ntable at the back of the room. The place was dimly lit and I hadn’t noticed her\nwhen we came in. A white sheet was pulled up to her chin. She was a small\nwoman with gray hair and her mouth was pinched shut. I remembered seeing\nher in church. I was in the middle of eating a cookie and now I put it down on\nthe tray.\n“Oh,” I said. “There she is.”\n“Yes,” said Father Li. “That’s her.”\n“Well,” I said. “I think I’ll go outside now.”\nIt was sunny in the courtyard and the parishioners were writing\nmemorials on long strips of white paper. A number of big funeral wreaths,\nmade of white tissue and bamboo, were set against the wall of the church. In\nthe sunshine I recovered quickly from the shock of seeing the body on the\ntable, and I watched the people as they went about the business of mourning.\nAll of the old ladies had been waiting patiently for me to finish my coffee,\nand now they entered the room to pay their respects to the body.\nThe woman’s son was there, a man in his fifties, and he was thrilled that a\nwaiguoren had come to his mother’s funeral. I told him that his mother had\nalways been very kind to me, which made him even happier. It was a\ntradition for the family to give small gifts at a funeral, and the son gave me\nsome fruit and a box of Magnificent Sound cigarettes. I thanked him and\naccepted the cigarettes. It was hard to imagine a more appropriate funeral\ngift.\nLater I went to the teahouse, where Zhang Xiaolong, the Luckiest Man in\nFuling, grinned and waved. He was with some of the other old men and I\ntook an empty table nearby. The waitress came over, smiling, and asked me\nwhat I wanted.",
        "“The yangguizi wants a cup of tea,” I said. Calling myself yangguizi,\n“foreign devil,” was one of the easiest and most disarming jokes in Fuling. I\nhad started using that word to describe myself during the summer, and people\noften didn’t know how to react; sometimes they were embarrassed and tried\nto persuade me to call myself something different. But I always responded by\nproudly saying something like “We foreign devils have a long history” or\n“We foreign devils have a great culture.”\nAt the teahouse it was an old joke between me and the xiaojie, the young\nwoman who worked there. She covered her mouth and laughed, and then she\npoured me a cup of tea. I had bought a newspaper on the street and now I\nread it while the tea cooled.\nIt was a typical day at the teahouse and a few people came up and talked\nwith me. At the end of the morning, a young woman whom I had never met\ncame and sat at my table. We talked for perhaps ten minutes. It was slightly\nunusual for a woman to approach me, but not so unusual that I thought\nanything of it. Her name was Li Jiali, and she asked for my phone number.\nThis was also common—I always gave my number to people in Fuling. The\nonly problem was that some of them had a tendency to call between the hours\nof five and seven o’clock in the morning, so I often took my phone off the\nhook when I was sleeping. I gave my number to Li Jiali and thought no more\nabout it.\nA week later I returned to the teahouse, and once again she sat at my\ntable. She was dressed in a very short skirt and tights and she wore a great\ndeal of makeup. She was not pretty, but she had successfully adopted a\nnumber of the habits that you saw in a certain type of xiaojie, who smiled too\nmuch and talked in a cutesy way, drawing out her words at the end of\nsentences. The woman who worked at the teahouse was not like this, and I\nsaw her shaking her head as Li Jiali sat posing at my table. The old men were\nstaring; even their birds seemed stunned into silence. I could see that\nsomething was happening that I didn’t understand, and so I excused myself,\npaid for the tea, and left.\nLi Jiali followed me out of the teahouse. “Where are you going?” she\nasked.\n“I have to go now,” I said. “I’m going to eat and then I’m going home.”\nWe passed a noodle restaurant where I often ate. Suddenly I had a great\nfear of this woman following me home and being seen with me on campus.",
        "“I’m leaving now,” I said. “I must eat at this restaurant. Goodbye.”\n“Oh, I’ll eat with you,” said Li Jiali.\nThe owner of the restaurant cleared a table and I found myself sitting\nthere with the woman. That was how everything always went in Fuling—\nthings happened to me. Usually I liked the passive unpredictability but today\nI was suspicious of her intentions, and yet I had no idea what to do. She sat\nthere chattering about something and I asked her where she worked.\n“That’s not important,” she said, and suddenly it became very important.\n“Do you work here in Fuling?”\n“It’s not a good job,” she said, shrugging. “But my uncle is getting me a\nbetter job in Chongqing. He owns a big restaurant—he’s very rich! He’s\ngiving me a job there as a xiaojie. The xiaojie at my uncle’s restaurant wear\nfine clothes—I’ll have to wear a qipao like this”—she showed me how it\nwould look: no shoulders, tight around the neck, slit high up her thigh.\n“Oh,” I said.\n“But it’s very expensive,” she said. “I’ll have to buy the qipao myself.”\n“That’s too bad,” I said.\n“Do you like to sing karaoke?”\n“No,” I said. “I do not like to sing karaoke. Most Americans do not like\nto sing.”\n“We should go to a karaoke bar sometime. I’ll teach you how to sing.”\n“Sorry, but I’m not interested in karaoke.”\n“That’s okay,” she said, smiling. “I’m very interested in your America.”\n“What about my America interests you?”\n“Everything. I would like to go there.”\nI did not like the way this conversation was going. “It’s very difficult to\ndo that,” I said.\n“I would like to live in your America,” she said. “People there have more\nmoney than here.”\n“There are many poor people in my America.”\n“Not as many as there are here in Fuling.”\nShe had a point and I tried a different tack. I talked about how difficult\nvisas were to obtain, and then our noodles arrived. I ate quickly and tried to\nthink of what to do next.\n“Ho Wei,” she said. “You are very ke’aide”—adorable. She said it in the\nbest xiaojie manner and I was certain that the others in the restaurant were",
        "listening now.\n“Your eyes are very pretty,” she said. “I think you waiguoren have\nprettier eyes than us Chinese.”\n“It’s not true,” I said dumbly. “Chinese are much prettier than waiguoren.\nWaiguoren are very hard to look at.” She took this as a compliment, smiling\nand trying to blush. I thought: Ho Wei, you are a jackass.\n“I like to hear you speak our Chinese language, Ho Wei,” she said. “It\nsounds very funny!”\nI remembered how guys in college used to hit on the local au pair girls\nfrom Sweden with their accents and cluelessness. It was not a pleasant\ncomparison, and I tried not to think about it.\nWe were leaving the restaurant now and the owner grinned knowingly as\nI paid. On the street Li Jiali took my arm and I stood there in passive\ndisbelief. A Fuling woman was touching me and we were right near the\nintersection of South Mountain Gate; everybody was honking at us, or so it\nseemed.\n“I have to go now,” I stammered. “You can’t come with me. I am very\nbusy today.”\n“Next week is my birthday,” Li Jiali said.\n“That’s nice,” I said.\n“I’ll see you next week,” she said.\nA cab swung by, horn blaring, and I smelled the hot breath of its exhaust.\nThe sun was warm and now I was sweating. “Goodbye,” I said, and at last\nshe let me go.\nTWO DAYS LATER, Li Jiali called and Ho Wei answered the phone. She\nasked if he would be at the teahouse on Sunday and he replied that he would.\nHe was there every Sunday and there was no reason to lie about that.\nAfter the phone call, I began to think once more about the possible\ncomplications of this particular aspect of my Chinese life, as well as the many\nways in which Ho Wei was not capable of dealing with them. The simplest\nsolution was to avoid going to the teahouse, but she knew I worked at the\ncollege and I did not want her to track me down there.\nI knew that Li Jiali was trouble—she was far too forward for a Chinese",
        "woman, and either she wanted money or she was crazy. Adam and I had both\nhad experiences with this in the first year. A freshman girl student had spent a\ncouple of weeks lurking outside of Adam’s apartment, and there was a\nmiddle-aged woman named Miss Ou who had pursued me more or less\nthroughout my time in Fuling. Both of these women were clearly unbalanced,\nand undoubtedly they turned to us because we were outside the loop, just like\nthem. That was at once the most interesting and most disturbing aspect of\nliving in Fuling—as a waiguoren you tended to attract a certain fringe\nelement. It was possible to have a Chinese life, but that didn’t mean it was a\nnormal Chinese life.\nLast year those complications had at least been in English, which gave us\na certain degree of control over the interactions. But now it was strictly in\nChinese—I met the people on their terms. And I knew that Li Jiali’s terms\nwould be difficult to deal with; somehow I would have to convince her that\nshe would not get whatever it was that she wanted. It was all Ho Wei’s show\nand I didn’t have much confidence in his ability to handle the problem.\nThe next Sunday, I delayed my trip to the teahouse as long as possible. I\nspent a long time chatting with Father Li, and then I wandered down to the\nblacksmith’s shop and watched them make chisels. It was nearly noon by the\ntime I made it to the teahouse.\nThe xiaojie brought me tea; I was too nervous to make any foreign-devil\njokes. She smiled and said that Li Jiali had been looking for me. I asked her if\nshe knew the woman.\n“I know her, but she’s not my friend.”\n“Where does she work?”\n“She works across the street, at the meifating.” It meant “beauty parlor,”\nbut it also meant something else, and the xiaojie, like everybody in Fuling,\nspoke the word with distinct scorn. Most of the city’s prostitutes worked in\nbeauty parlors and now I knew for certain what Li Jiali did for a living.\nI sat there and waited for her. One of the teahouse regulars came over and\ntalked with me. Usually he was annoying, because he was a fanatical disciple\nof Falun Gong, which was a mixture of Buddhism, Taoism, and qigong-style\ndeep-breathing exercises. At first I had been interested in hearing him talk\nabout Falun Gong, simply because I had never heard of it and the local\nfollowers seemed to believe with religious intensity, which was a rare passion\nin Fuling. But soon the man came to see me as a potential convert, and he",
        "often telephoned and gave me long lectures on the benefits of Falun Gong.\nHe especially liked to call at five o’clock in the morning, because it showed\nhow little sleep he needed now that Falun Gong had entered his life.\nIt was another mess of Ho Wei’s. I had no interest in any sort of qigong\n—I was a runner and I disliked the idea of an exercise regimen that involved\nmoving as slowly as possible. Of course, I might have been more interested\nin talking with the man if I had known that in 1999 the Communist Party\nwould ban Falun Gong as a cult, persecuting its followers. But in Fuling I had\nno idea that the practice would someday become such a political issue, and I\nnever would have imagined that the government would consider it to be a\nthreat. As far as I was concerned, the main problem with Falun Gong was\nthat it woke me up at five o’clock in the morning.\nBut today I was happy for any distraction and I listened to the man’s\nlecture. A major sticking point between us was alcohol—his personal\ninterpretation of Falun Gong stressed no smoking or drinking, and in a\nmoment of desperation I had latched onto this as a way of discouraging him,\nexplaining that there was no way I could ever give up beer. Like so many of\nHo Wei’s solutions, this was a serious miscalculation. It resulted in the man’s\nmaking a full-fledged assault on the dangers of alcohol, week after week, in\nmind-numbing detail. His lectures began with the way alcohol settles in your\ncells, whereas Falun Gong seeks to bring everything into balance at the\ncellular level. There was more to this explanation, but I always lost the thread\nand sat there nodding as if I understood.\nLi Jiali arrived while the man was lecturing. She smiled and sat down at\nour table. I didn’t acknowledge her, and the man continued lecturing about\nalcohol and Falun Gong. All of the old bird men were watching.\nShe was dressed brightly again and she put on her makeup at our table.\nShe dabbed rouge onto her cheeks, looking into a tiny mirror, and then she\nput on eyeshadow. In Fuling, few women wore much makeup, and even\nfewer painted their faces in public, which was a sign of loose morals. There\nwere many signs like that—the clearest was for a xiaojie to smoke a cigarette\nin public, because when a Fuling woman did that you could be almost certain\nthat she was a prostitute. Li Jiali was not smoking but the show of painting\nher face was bad enough.\nShe tried several times to get my attention until at last I looked over.\n“Ho Wei,” she said, “your American name is Pete, isn’t it?”",
        "“Yes.” She had asked me this the first time we met, and now I regretted\ntelling her.\n“Pete,” she said. She pronounced it “Bee-do” and I didn’t like hearing her\nsay it; I saw no reason to bring that name into Ho Wei’s mess. “Bee-do,” she\nsaid again, “did you bring me a gift?”\n“No.”\n“I told you it was my birthday!” Again this was the flirty xiaojie voice\nand I felt my anger rise.\n“In America we don’t have that tradition,” I said.\n“You don’t give presents on birthdays?”\n“We don’t ask people to give us presents.”\nIt was one of the sharpest things Ho Wei had ever said, but it didn’t faze\nher. I could bring her a present next week, she said. She asked if I would take\nher to lunch today, and I decided that I had had enough.\n“I already have a girlfriend,” I lied. “At the college I have a waiguoren\ngirlfriend—the tall one with red hair.” I figured that Noreen was the best\nchoice, because she was tall and her height sometimes intimidated the\nChinese. The Falun Gong man was listening carefully now.\n“That’s okay,” Li Jiali said. “It doesn’t matter if you have a girlfriend.”\n“I have to go now,” I said. “I don’t want to eat lunch.”\n“I’ll go with you,” the man said.\nWe stood up and Li Jiali said something to him. They were talking\nquickly in the dialect, and I walked out of the teahouse. On the street they\ncaught up with me. The Falun Gong man was on my left, and Li Jiali started\ntugging at my right arm. “Bee-do,” she said, “where are you going?”\n“Please leave me alone,” I said.\nI pulled away, slipping into the crowd, and the Falun Gong man\nwhispered in my ear, “What’s your guanxi with her?”\n“There’s no guanxi. I don’t know who she is. She bothers me.”\n“You don’t have any interest in her?”\n“No, not at all.”\nLi Jiali had caught us again, and she came between me and the man. He\nsaid something to her and she responded sharply, and now he turned and\nfaced her. He shouted at the woman and she shouted back, calling him a\ngui’erzi, a Sichuanese obscenity meaning “son of a turtle.” All of the xiaojie\ncuteness was gone, and it was as if a mask had been stripped away; she spat",
        "at him and shouted obscenely like a whore. People stopped to watch. The\nman stood his ground, shouting back, and in a minute it was over. Li Jiali\ntossed her head and stormed down the street.\nThe crowd dispersed and I walked to the bus stop with the Falun Gong\nman. I looked back over my shoulder and I could feel my heart beating. For\nonce I was glad that I had tolerated so many of the man’s phone calls and\nlectures about alcohol. I promised myself that I would always be polite with\nhim, and that at least once I would try his exercises.\n“She was asking me to leave you alone with her,” he said.\n“Is she a prostitute?”\n“Perhaps,” he said, but it was the Chinese perhaps that meant: Certainly.\nWe came to the bus and I thanked him.\n“You need to be more careful,” he said. “Often people like that will want\nyou for your money, or because you’re a waiguoren. You shouldn’t give your\nphone number to everybody. And remember that I don’t want your money—I\nonly want to teach you Falun Gong. I’m different from her.”\nI nodded and got on the bus. For the next three weeks I shifted my\nroutines to avoid the teahouse. Li Jiali moved to Chongqing, and later that\nfall she sent me a series of love letters, which I ignored. I never saw her\nagain. I never tried Falun Gong. In the early mornings I kept my phone off\nthe hook. I realized that complications were an inevitable result of my\nChinese life, but I also realized that even at his worst Ho Wei could find a\nway to bumble out of problems. I had allowed him this much freedom, and in\nthe end it was like an adult watching a child grow up—there was only so\nmuch control that I could take over that part of my life, and its\nunpredictability, although risky, was much of its charm. All I could do was\nlet Ho Wei go his own way and hope for the best.",
        "THE RESTAURANT OWNER\nHUANG XIAOQIANG WANTS A VIDEODISC PLAYER. He wants a\ncellular phone. He wants a car so he can work as a cab driver. He wants to\ninvest more money in the stock market, and he wants to increase his earnings\nso all of the people he lives with, his parents and wife and two-year-old son,\ncan have a better apartment and more security. He wants all of these things,\nbut all he has right now is a small noodle restaurant called the Students’\nHome, and so he does the best he can with that.\nWhat the noodle restaurant has is good location. It is more or less at the\ncenter of the East River district, across the street from the college gate, where\nwomen sell fruit and snacks from makeshift stands. There are almost always\nstudents sitting at the restaurant’s six tables, and things are especially busy on\nSunday evenings, when the students finish their political meetings and head\nout for dinner. Above the Students’ Home there is a karaoke bar of suspicious\npurpose, and in the evening the karaoke xiaojies come downstairs for meals.\nThe xiaojies wear beepers and too much makeup, and they talk too loudly,\neating noodles alongside the fresh-faced students who have just finished their\ndiscussions of Socialism with Chinese Characteristics.\nHuang Xiaoqiang knows all of the locals—the bus drivers and the fruit\nvendors, the ceramics factory workers and the shop owners, the students and\nthe karaoke xiaojies. He knows their routines, the bus schedules and the\nfactory work shifts and the college political meetings, and his own routine is\nintertwined with the rest of the East River lives. The restaurant’s schedule is\nsimple: it opens at six o’clock in the morning and closes at eleven at night.\n“Hen xinku,” Huang often says. “Very difficult.” But he is only half in\nearnest, because he has so much help: his parents and his wife, a pretty\ntwenty-five-year-old woman named Feng Xiaoqin. Often his older sister, who\nworks down the street at the ceramics factory, stops by to help. And usually\nthere are other workers, relatives and friends from the Huangs’ home village",
        "of Baitao, south of Fuling. In fact, of all the workers Huang Xiaoqiang is\nprobably the least diligent. His wife and mother are the backbone of the\nrestaurant, because Huang spends much of his time smoking Magnificent\nSound cigarettes and cultivating guanxi with the local men.\nHe is twenty-six years old, and five years ago he took the long train ride\nfrom Chengdu to the western desert province of Xinjiang in order to look for\nwork. “Too cold,” he says. “There were jobs, and the jobs were fine, but the\nweather was no good. Too cold in the winter, too hot in the summer.” The\nfollowing year he went south to Guangzhou, where the weather was better\nbut the jobs not to his taste.\nThis is a common pattern for young people in Sichuan, which in the past\nwas the most populous province in China, home to more than 120 million\npeople. In March of 1997, the province was split in two, with Fuling and the\nother river towns falling under the jurisdiction of the newly created\nChongqing Municipality. This change was made to improve administration of\nthe overcrowded region, as well as help prepare for the Three Gorges Project,\nbut the split is still too recent to have affected the common notion of what\ncomposes Sichuan. Fuling residents still refer to themselves as Sichuanese,\nand there is still no shortage of men and women from this part of the world.\nOne of every fifty people on earth comes from Sichuan.\nAnd often they go somewhere else. The region’s mountains and river\nvalleys have long been home to the sort of hardships that send young people\naway, and in every Chinese city it is possible to find Sichuanese migrants.\nThey can be found with particular frequency working in restaurants, or\nlaboring on construction sites, or staffing beauty parlors. The urban Chinese\noften do not like the Sichuanese migrants, describing them as hardworking\nbut uncultured, clever but untrustworthy. Some people say the Sichuanese\nwomen are tramps; the men are jiaohua, sly. These are, of course, familiar\nstereotypes to anybody who is an industrious and determined migrant in any\npart of the world, and they deter the Sichuanese exactly as much as they deter\nothers who have left difficult conditions—in short, not at all. This is\nsomething else that the Sichuanese are famous for, their ability to chiku, to\neat bitter. They don’t care what people think, and they don’t care what work\nthey find, as long as it is work. And in hordes they continue to leave the\nregion.\nBut Huang Xiaoqiang came home. He married, bought his restaurant,",
        "settled into the routine. In the mornings, he and the other workers make\nchaoshou, the local version of wonton, and at midday they hustle to handle\nthe lunch rush, and late at night, when the next day’s rice noodles arrive, they\ntie the soft strands into five-ounce bundles so they will be ready for\ntomorrow. Day after day it is exactly the same.\nRARELY DOES Huang Xiaoqiang talk about politics in the restaurant. One\nevening, when asked about the government, he shrugs his shoulders and says\nthat with regard to China’s policies he has no guanxi. “Jiang Zemin is very\nbig,” he says. “And I am very small.”\nHe notices a picture of Mao Zedong on the cover of an English book,\nEdgar Snow’s Red Star over China, and he studies the title. “Kanbudong,” he\nsays, laughing. “I don’t understand.” But he comprehends the picture; he has\na poster of Mao on the wall of his home. “Mao Zedong was our leader,” he\nsays. “During the Revolution, he was a great man, but afterward…” He\nshakes his head. And then comes one of those stories that are so common in\nChina, the kind of story that makes the country seem hopelessly foreign to\nany outsider.\nIt’s a short story, really. Huang’s grandfather was a peasant landlord, and\nin 1958, during the struggle of Communist land reform, he was executed.\nHuang demonstrates how they shot him—in the back of the neck—and then\nhe laughs. But it is the unsettling Chinese laugh that has nothing to do with\nhumor. It simply takes the place of words that aren’t there.\nBut in the mad rush that is recent Chinese history, 1958 was a very long\ntime ago, which is another reason why such stories are so short. They are told\nand then they are gone.\n“Today everything’s better,” Huang Xiaoqiang says quickly. “In the past\nyou couldn’t speak freely. Everything you said, you always had to worry\nabout whether it was Capitalist or Counter-Revolutionary. But it’s not like\nthat now. Since Deng Xiaoping was the leader, everything has been fine. The\nliving standard is much higher and we can have private business. We’re the\nsame as landlords, really.”\nThis causes a brief debate in the restaurant, where the customers begin\narguing with Huang. The word “landlord” is still politically charged, and",
        "perhaps he used it too lightly. But the debate doesn’t last long; the others\nrealize that he is referring to opportunity rather than exploitation, and in any\ncase none of them cares much for politics. Most, like Huang, are independent\nworkers: bus drivers, vendors, shop owners. They don’t belong to a danwei,\nwhich means that profits are defined solely by intelligence, effort, and luck.\nThe absence of a danwei also means that they enjoy significant freedom.\nHuang Xiaoqiang attends no political meetings. Nobody tells him how many\nhours to work or what to serve in his restaurant. The income tax he pays is\nminimal and actually has little guanxi to what he makes. A government\nofficial comes every year to estimate the monthly earnings of the restaurant,\nand Huang pays ten percent of that. Currently the estimate is one thousand\nyuan a month, and accordingly his monthly tax is one hundred. In fact, the\nrestaurant generally clears between two and three thousand yuan each month,\nbut regardless, the tax is the same. One of the Characteristics of Chinese\nSocialism is that small enterprises can engage in virtually unrestricted\ncapitalism, which works to the advantage of the Huang family.\nBut another Characteristic is that the government provides no insurance\nto people without a danwei, and so the restaurant follows a long schedule of\nseventeen-hour days while Huang Xiaoqiang looks for new ways to make\nmoney. In the meantime, though, he is content to run his restaurant, and with\nregard to China’s politics he has neither deep complaints nor broad vision.\nAnd his non-danwei customers are more or less the same. They just want to\nwork and carve out a good living, and if, like him, they can work with their\nfamilies, their happiness is doubled.\nTHE WORLD of the Students’ Home is small. It doesn’t extend much\nbeyond the East River district, and it is centered on Huang’s family. His two-\nyear-old son, Huang Kai, took his first steps in the restaurant. He read his\nfirst simple characters from the menu board, and his first favorite food was\nchaoshou. During lulls in the day, the boy sits on his grandparents’ laps and\nlooks at children’s books. His grandmother, Wang Chaosu, is illiterate, but\nshe knows the books by heart and she recites them to Huang Kai.\nThey have no desire to go elsewhere. “We’re here for yibeizi,” Huang\nXiaoqiang says. “A lifetime.” Sometimes they express interest in the outside",
        "world—Huang’s father, Huang Neng, often asks how much a plane ticket to\nAmerica costs, and how long it takes. “Fifteen hours!” he says once, amazed.\n“Do they have bathrooms on the plane?”\n“Of course they do,” laughs his daughter-in-law, Feng Xiaoqin. Another\ncustomer at the restaurant, a local shop owner, speaks up. “There are big\nbuses between Chongqing and Chengdu that have bathrooms,” he says\nknowingly. “Telephones, too. On the high-speed expressway they take just\nfour hours.”\nBut this is only talk; they have no wish to travel. “It’s too expensive,”\nsays Feng Xiaoqin. And if she had the money? “If I had ten thousand yuan,\nthen I’d want forty thousand,” she laughs. “That’s the way I am, just like\neverybody else—it’s never enough. You Americans like traveling so much.\nIt’s too much trouble: you have to carry your bag here, carry your bag there. I\nwouldn’t want to go to America and have to learn English. It’s too much\nhassle.”\nAny changes are made within the world of the restaurant. In the fall of\n1997, the college, which owns the building, suddenly raises the monthly rent\nfrom three hundred yuan to seven hundred, and the Huang family cuts down\non spending. They buy a public telephone to increase profits. But the first\nmonth they lose three hundred yuan, because they don’t understand the long-\ndistance rates. The next month they adjust and turn a profit. Huang Xiaoqiang\nspends four weeks and three thousand yuan on a training course so he can get\nhis driver’s license. This document is his proudest possession; obtaining the\nprivilege to drive is difficult and expensive in China. He begins to look for\nwork. “I have no guanxi,” he says. “But that’s not the most important thing.\nMostly they look at your ability, and you have to be lucky.”\nAnd so he has no job, but he has his license, which means opportunity.\nAnd of course he has his restaurant and his new phone. He also has a five-\nroom apartment, which is big by Fuling standards. He has a color television\nand a stereo and a 35mm camera. He has one son. He has his family, and his\nfamily has the patronage and respect of the students and the East River\npeople, who see the Huangs as generous and good-hearted. Their world is\nsmall, but they take good care of it.",
        "IT IS EARLY MORNING and Huang Xiaoqiang is making chaoshou. He\nsits in front of the ingredients: a bowl of pork filling, a plate of small square\ndough wrappers, a bowl of water, a pan. He holds a chopstick. He picks up a\nwrapper in one hand. With the chopstick he draws out a pinch of pork filling\nand places it in the square of dough. Then he dips the chopstick in the water,\nand uses it to fold the corners of the wrapper around the meat. The finished\ndumpling extends in two points, one crossing on top of the other. He drops\nthe dumpling into the pan.\nElsewhere in China this food is called hundun, but the Sichuanese have\ntheir own way of speaking, and they call it chaoshou—“crossed hands”—\nbecause of the way the corners of the dumpling overlap. In most parts of\nSichuan, you can walk into a restaurant and order chaoshou without making a\nsound. Cross your arms and they will understand exactly what you want.\nIt takes Huang Xiaoqiang less than five seconds to make the dumpling.\nHe picks up another wrapper, inserts the meat, wets the corners, folds them\nover, and drops the chaoshou into the pan. It looks exactly the same as the\nfirst one. He makes another, and then one more. Outside the sun is rising and\nthe minibuses are honking and the fruit women have set up their stands.\nOranges are in season. Huang Xiaoqiang makes more chaoshou. All of them\nare well-made and they look exactly alike.",
        "CHAPTER NINE",
        "Money\nMONEY MEANT VERY LITTLE TO ME IN FULING. I made one\nthousand yuan a month, while the average per capita income for a Chinese\nurban household was 430 yuan—fifty-odd American dollars, at the official\nexchange rate of slightly more than eight yuan to the dollar. In rural areas the\nper capita income was only 175 yuan a month, but peasants could stretch\nmoney farther because they grew their own food.\nMy salary was relatively high, and it was comfortable as long as I didn’t\ntravel much. A ticket on the hydrofoil to Chongqing cost eighty yuan,\nalthough you could save money by taking the overnight slow boat for twenty-\nfour yuan, which was how most of the locals traveled. During my first year I\nalways rode the slow boat upstream, until one evening when a rat ran over\nmy head while I was sleeping.\nI woke up and turned on the light. There were rats all over the cabin—fat\nbrown Yangtze rats with long noodle tails. They scampered across the floor,\nrooting in people’s luggage. One of them was climbing over a sleeping\nwoman in a lower berth. The woman shifted under her covers but didn’t wake\nup. I watched the rats for a while. At last I left the cabin.\nThe rest of the night I sat out on deck, listening to the river slip past. I\nthought about the money I was saving by taking that boat, which amounted to\nseven dollars. After that trip I always paid extra for the hydrofoils when I\nwent upriver, but these were rare occasions. I had some friends in Chongqing,\nbut otherwise there wasn’t anything interesting about going there. Mostly I\ndidn’t travel.\nStaying in Fuling made it difficult to spend all of my monthly salary,\nwhich was my goal. There was no reason to save it; by living carefully I\ncould put away three hundred yuan a month, which meant that a year of\nfrugality would reward me with a total of four hundred American dollars.\nThat was one of the best aspects of life in the Peace Corps: my salary was so",
        "low that it was pointless to save money, but my Fuling routines were so\nsimple and cheap that I didn’t have to worry about budgeting my expenses. In\na sense it was the richest I could ever be, because it was like toy money and I\ndidn’t have to think about it at all.\nI wasted a good part of my salary while I wandered around the city,\nbuying anything that caught my eye—books, pictures, trinkets, black-market\ncassette tapes. Once I picked up a bamboo fishing rod for no reason at all and\nput it in the corner of my dining room, where it gathered dust. At the military\nsurplus stores I bought People’s Liberation Army uniforms and accessories.\nThey sold nearly everything at those stores—clothes, shoes, gear. A\nnightstick was 30 yuan; handcuffs cost 130. Anybody with 300 yuan could\nwalk in off the street and pick up a high-powered electric stun gun. If you had\na permission slip from your danwei, you could buy a wicked spiked mace for\nless than 200. They didn’t sell pistols but you could buy the holsters.\nFrom different stores I put my uniform together piece by piece: old-style\nPLA trousers with a red-and-yellow stripe down the leg, a Public Security\nvest, a nice military jacket with padded shoulders, a short-brimmed Red\nArmy cap with a star on the front. When I picked up my epaulets for fifteen\nyuan, the saleswoman told me very seriously that they were the wrong ones\n—apparently there was something else that a waiguoren should wear on his\nshoulders when he dressed up as a PLA officer. I bought them anyway; they\nmatched the star on my cap and the stripes on my trousers.\nOn special occasions I wore my uniform for teaching, which always\nmade the students excited; some of them tried to convince me that I should\nwear it every day. I never wore the entire ensemble into town, but I often\nwore the trousers, which were comfortable. Many of the peasants and stick-\nstick soldiers wore those as well, and sometimes people asked if was a\nUighur.\nApart from the money I wasted, nearly all of my salary went toward food,\nbecause I ate out every meal. The restaurants were among the most pleasant\nplaces in the city, with some of my best friends as their owners, and the\nSichuanese food was excellent. There was no reason to cook for myself in\nFuling.\nAt least once a day I ate at the Students’ Home noodle restaurant. Often I\nate alone, but sometimes during the week all four of the volunteers met there\nfor lunch. We showed Feng Xiaoqin how to cook a Sichuanese version of",
        "spaghetti, and Adam wrote that foreign word on the menu. Nobody else ever\nordered the spaghetti. After they acquired a telephone, Adam and I\nsometimes called to order our meals in advance. This professional touch\npleased the workers, who in turn started telephoning our apartments and\ninviting us to meals. I’d answer the phone and Huang Xiaoqiang would say:\nAre you coming for lunch? What do you want to eat? Adam and I would tell\nhim one bowl of noodles and one bowl of spaghetti, and then we’d run down\nthe hill and catch it hot off the wok.\nI liked the restaurant best on Sunday nights, when it was crowded with\nstudents and the street was full of people enjoying the last of the weekend.\nBut it was also good in the late afternoon, when business was slow and I\ncould sit alone with my newspaper. I’d chat with the family, often about\nmoney, which was what everybody talked about in Fuling. I was accustomed\nto talking about that, even though for me it wasn’t real money and I let it slip\nthrough my fingers every month.\nOne afternoon in December, I sat there watching Huang Kai play on the\nsteps of the restaurant. He was, like all Chinese children in winter, a bundle\nof grubby clothes. His cap and pants had been hand-knit by his mother. His\npants were slit at the crotch, because he had not yet been toilet-trained, and\nhis buttocks and inner thighs were pink in the cold. He was nearly two years\nold. He wore layer upon layer of shirts and sweaters, topped by a fake leather\njacket that his mother had bought in town. “It’s poor quality,” she had said\ndismissively, when I complimented her on it. “It was only twenty yuan.” She\nalways told me the prices of Huang Kai’s clothes and toys.\nI was eating noodles and drinking water from my clear plastic American-\nmade Nalgene bottle. In China those camping bottles were invaluable; they\nwere made of hard plastic that could hold the boiled water that was always\navailable in hotels, restaurants, trains, and boats. When I first arrived in\nSichuan, the bottles had been uncommon, although occasionally in a big city\nlike Chengdu I’d meet a cab driver who had one. Usually it had been\npurchased by a relative or a friend in one of the well-developed coastal cities\nlike Shenzhen.\nIn early spring of 1997, a few Chengdu shops started stocking Nalgene-\nknockoff bottles, and by June everybody had them. Chengdu was a relatively\nhip city where Western styles tended to spread quickly, often without clear\ncause or meaning. Most bicycles in the city had rear fenders decorated with",
        "“Pentium Intel Inside” stickers, the same kind that accompanied computers in\nAmerica. Nearly all of the Chengdu bicycles had only one gear, and they\nmost certainly did not have Intel Inside; but the stickers were trendy and you\nsaw them on fenders everywhere.\nThe demand for Nalgene-knockoff bottles was much more\nunderstandable, especially in a tea-drinking city like Chengdu, where the\nbottles spread quickly throughout the city’s social strata. They were first\nacquired by cab drivers, who tended to be at the forefront of such trends—\ncabbies had a certain maverick quality, as well as plenty of money. After that,\nthe businessmen followed suit, and then the xiaojies, and finally by summer\neven the old people in the teahouses were sipping their tea out of fake\nNalgene bottles. Soon you could buy them for twenty yuan in any Sichuan\ncity or town.\nThe bottles came with a label that described them as American-developed\nTaikong Pingzi—Outer Space Bottles. But they were clearly the product of\nChinese factories, because they weren’t quite standard and often the label was\nmisspelled. In that regard things hadn’t changed greatly from the seventeenth\ncentury, when a Spanish priest named Domingo Navarrete described business\nmethods in China. “The Chinese are very ingenious at imitation,” he wrote.\n“They have imitated to perfection whatsoever they have seen brought out of\nEurope. In the Province of Canton they have counterfeited several things so\nexactly, that they sell them Inland for Goods brought out from Europe.”\nEven after the bottles became common in Fuling, Huang Kai never got\nover the fascination he had with the ones that Adam and I carried. It had\nsomething to do with the shiny plastic, as well as their association with the\nwaiguoren, whom Huang Kai never quite trusted.\nOn that day in December, I shook my bottle and set it on a stool. The\nchild toddled over, cautious but interested.\n“Gupiao,” he said. “Gupiao.”\nThe word meant “stock,” as in stock market. I turned to his mother. “He\nthinks it looks like the stock market report on television,” she said, laughing.\nShe pointed to the side of the bottle, where the volume levels were marked in\ngradients from one hundred to nine hundred milliliters. My water was at five\nhundred and falling.\nHuang Kai forgot the bottle and returned to the steps. He crouched over,\npants gaping, and rolled a toy car along the ground. A moment later I heard",
        "him babbling to himself. “Mao Zhuxi, Mao Zhuxi,” he said. “Chairman Mao,\nChairman Mao.” I had no idea what had prompted him to say this; there was\na poster of Mao in his living room at home and perhaps he was thinking of\nthat. He was not yet two years old but already plenty was mixed up inside his\nhead.\nCHAIRMAN MAO HATED MONEY. His father—a crafty, grasping\nlandlord—had made quite a bit of it, and partly in reaction Mao Zedong\ndespised anything that had to do with money. As a poor revolutionary he was\nscornful of it, and as the Communist Party’s Chairman he refused to touch it.\nMao was the father of New China, and perhaps it was in reaction to him\nthat the Chinese nowadays spent so much time thinking and talking about\nmoney. Or maybe it was simply that now they had more than ever before,\nwith more ways to earn and spend it, and yet with all that new money it still\nwasn’t enough. Everywhere in Fuling that was what people talked about.\nIt was nothing to be ashamed of; there was no reason to be coy when it\ncame to financial matters. Everybody knew everybody else’s salary, and if a\nfriend had something new—a shirt, a radio, a pen—you asked him how much\nit cost, and he told you. Mentioning money was nearly as routine as the\ntraditional greeting people used in Fuling and other parts of China: Chi fan\nmeiyou? Have you eaten yet? Until recently most of the country had been\npoor, and eating was something the people took real pleasure in, just as they\ntook real pleasure in earning whatever money they could.\nI liked this openness; it helped me understand people’s lives, because I\ncould ask them about their salaries or expenses without offending them. I\nalways told people my own salary—generally it was the second or third\nquestion they asked. By the second year this disclosure was hardly necessary;\nit seemed that everybody in the city already knew. One evening I sat on a\nbench at South Mountain Gate, talking with the crowd that gathered, and\nsomebody asked how much I made every month. Before I could respond,\nanother voice in the crowd shouted out, “He makes one thousand yuan! All of\nthe foreign teachers at the college make that same salary.”\nPeople talked about money all the time, and yet I wouldn’t describe them\nas greedy: the Chinese I knew in Fuling were incredibly and sincerely",
        "generous. If I ate a meal with somebody else, he or she paid; that was simply\nhow it worked, and usually there was nothing I could do about it. Our\nstudents were the same way—if they happened to be eating in the Students’\nHome at the same time as Adam and me, they always tried to pay our bill,\ndespite their tight finances. The average student budget was around two\nhundred yuan a month, or twenty-four dollars, which was a significant\nexpense for many of their families. Because most of the college’s students\ncame from poor rural areas, the government gave each one an additional\nstipend of fifty yuan a month.\nAt the noodle restaurant we learned to pay in advance when students\nwere around, although the owners didn’t approve of this. “You’re their\nteacher,” Feng Xiaoqin told me once. “They respect you, and they should pay\nfor your meal. That’s our tradition in China.” She was generous, too; often at\nthe restaurant I ate for free.\nPart of this was simply the “foreign friend” syndrome, but to a lesser\ndegree they were the same way with each other. In particular they were\ngenerous with their families—if a close relative needed money, it was given\nwithout hesitation and with no expectation of repayment. One of my\ngraduated first-year students, Aumur, had taken a teaching job in Tibet,\nwhere the salary was one thousand yuan a month—more than twice what he\nwould have made in the countryside of Sichuan. But Aumur sent half of his\nTibet salary home to his parents, who were peasants, and yet there was not\nthe slightest sense of burden or regret that accompanied this generosity. “It’s\nmy duty,” he said simply, when I asked him about it, and he explained that\nthis was the only way that his younger brother could afford his school tuition\nfees. Aumur’s commitment in Tibet was eight years, and if he left early the\nfines were as high as twenty thousand yuan, but I never heard him complain\nabout the work he was doing to support his parents and brother.\nEverything had a price in Fuling, where fines were a common part of life.\nStudents were fined ten yuan if they failed an exam, two yuan for\nunsatisfactory cleaning of the classroom, and one and a half yuan for\nskipping morning exercises. I knew Peace Corps teachers at another Sichuan\ncollege where a student was fined five hundred yuan—enough money for two\nmonths’ expenses—for publicly holding hands with his girlfriend on campus\nwhile a government delegation was in town.\nAll of this was good preparation for adult life, which also had its share of",
        "fines. Sometimes you even had to pay to take a new job—a sort of reverse\nbonus. Teacher Liao had originally worked in a college in her hometown of\nZigong, but her husband was on the Fuling faculty and after they married she\nwanted to move. She applied for and received a job in Fuling, but that was\nwhen the complications started. The Zigong danwei required a payment of\nfive thousand yuan before it granted her permission to leave, and Fuling\nTeachers College also could have charged her a similar amount before\nallowing her to start work. But Fuling waived the fee—a sign that they very\nmuch wanted Teacher Liao in their Chinese department. She was proud that\nFuling Teachers College had given her a job without charging her a single\nyuan. You had to be a good teacher to get a job like that for free.\nThe going rate for a second child was more than ten thousand yuan, at\nleast in the countryside close to the college. In the city it was rare that\nanybody got to the point where she paid this fine—if a woman was pregnant\nwith her second child, she would be threatened with the loss of her job. If she\ndidn’t work for a state-run danwei, there were other ways of applying\npressure, and having a second child could result in a woman’s being forced to\nundergo sterilization surgery.\nMost of the city residents seemed accustomed to the planned-birth policy,\naccepting its implications without complaint. After all, they spent every day\nnegotiating Fuling’s crowded streets and sidewalks, which made the need for\npopulation control easy to understand. But attitudes were different in the\ncountryside. Out there you could dodge the authorities, and the Chinese had a\nphrase for this evasion—Chaosheng Youjidui, “Guerrilla Birth Team.” A\nwoman might go live with relatives until she had the baby, and then she\nwould return home and pay the fine. It wasn’t so common close to the city,\nwhere the authorities could control things tightly, but the average family size\nincreased as you went farther into the hills.\nOnce I was on the bus with a peasant woman who was returning from\nmarket, and we had the same simple conversation that I had with so many of\nthe dialect speakers. She asked me how much money I made, and where I\nwas from, and why I had come to such a lousy place as Fuling. This was a\ncommon theme in my conversations—people always wondered why a self-\nrespecting waiguoren would live in a place like Fuling for one thousand yuan\na month. I had no answer for that; I wasn’t about to tell them the truth, that\nFuling’s imperfections were part of why I liked the city so much, and that I",
        "felt rich precisely because I made so little money that I didn’t have to worry\nabout saving anything.\nI told the woman that I had been sent to Fuling by the U.S. government,\nwhich was the simplest way to explain my situation—everybody in China\nunderstood what it meant when a government decided where you worked. I\nasked the woman about her family, and she said she had two children, a\ndaughter and a young son.\n“But don’t you have trouble if you have two children?” I asked.\n“Yes, but not too much. We had to pay a fine.”\n“How much for your son?”\n“Four thousand yuan.”\n“That’s not as much as people pay now, is it?”\n“No. Nowadays they pay more than ten thousand. For us it wasn’t so\nmuch.”\n“That’s good,” I said.\n“It was cheaper back then,” she said nostalgically. “In those days the\nfines weren’t so bad.”\n“Can you save four thousand yuan in a year?”\n“Unless it’s a bad year.”\n“So that’s not too much at all.”\n“No,” she said. “It wasn’t.”\nThe woman sat there smiling, thinking about the four-thousand-yuan son\nwho was waiting for her at home. She arranged the things in her bamboo\nbasket and turned to me again.\n“Do you have a planned-birth policy in your country?”\n“No.”\n“So how many children can you have?”\n“As many as we want.”\n“Really?”\n“Really,” I said. “If you want to have ten children, you can have ten.\nThere’s no limit. But most people only have two, because that’s all they\nwant.”\nThe woman smiled wistfully, shaking her head. I wondered what amazed\nher more—that there was a country where birth wasn’t limited, or that\nAmericans were so foolish as to want only two children. Many of the\npeasants I met seemed inclined to go with the second viewpoint, and",
        "sometimes they had the same reaction to American farming, which to a\nSichuanese peasant seemed to be an incredible combination of luck and\nincompetence. They found it remarkable that the average farmer in a state\nlike Missouri had 292 acres of land, as well as mechanized equipment and the\noccasional government subsidy, and yet there were still years when it was\ndifficult to make ends meet. As far as the peasants were concerned, you had\nto be a particularly bad farmer to ruin a setup like that, just as you had to be\nparticularly foolish to respond to complete procreative freedom by having\njust two children.\nMy students were part of the last peasant generation whose fines had\nbeen minimal. The second-year speaking class had thirty-five students, of\nwhom only two were single children. Those two were free and the rest had\ncost very little, if anything at all. Diana cost one hundred yuan. Davy’s little\nbrother cost three hundred yuan. Rex had a 650-yuan sister, while Julia’s\nbrother was only 190. Jeremy was one hundred yuan. He was the sixth child\nin his family, and the older five had all been girls. That was a very well spent\none hundred yuan if you were a Chinese peasant.\nMany of their families were like that—a string of girls punctuated by a\nboy that marked the end of the children. In those days the fines had been\nminimal, and the peasants still followed the traditional pattern of having\nchildren until there was at least one son. The fines, like everything else\nregarding money were not sensitive subjects. Sometimes I teased Jeremy\nbecause he had cost only one hundred yuan. I offered to buy Julia’s brother\nfor five hundred, so her parents could double their investment, but she only\nlaughed and shook her head.\nMOST OF MY GRADUATED STUDENTS were assigned jobs in the\ncountryside, where they made around four hundred yuan a month—less than\nfifty dollars. It was very little money but the jobs were secure, and they didn’t\nhave to search by themselves. Communist China had no tradition of\nindependent job searches, and the thought of relying on themselves terrified\nmost of my students, who generally accepted the assignments. They also took\nthese positions because they were penalized if they refused the government\njob. If they chose to find work on their own, they had to repay the scholarship",
        "they had received, which usually amounted to around five thousand yuan.\nDuring my second year, the authorities began to reform these rules, phasing\nout the automatic assignments, but my first group of graduated students was\nstill in the traditional system.\nThe more aggressive students often paid the fine or found some other\nway to avoid the assigned job. Five of the boys took teaching positions in\nTibet—all of them were Party Members, and they went for reasons of\npatriotism as well as money. North, who had been one of the class monitors,\ntook a sales job with the Wu River Hot Pickled Mustard Tuber factory. Two\nof the best girl students found teaching jobs at a private school in the eastern\nprovince of Zhejiang. Anne, the student whose family lived in my building,\nwandered southward—first she worked as a secretary in Kunming, in Yunnan\nprovince, and then she went to Shenzhen, the special economic zone near\nHong Kong.\nShenzhen was a sort of promised land for Sichuanese migrants. People\nmade money quickly there, sometimes without guanxi or education; all you\nneeded was your wits and some luck. There were Shenzhen legends at all of\nthe Sichuan teachers colleges where my Peace Corps friends taught. Students\nwhispered about classmates who, having been thrown out of school for\ncheating or failing exams, went south to Shenzhen and were rich within a\nyear, thankful that the college had tossed them. During my first year, an\nEnglish department student named Don had been kicked out of Fuling for\ncheating, after which he followed the standard expelled student route and\nwent straight to Shenzhen. But in the booming city he struck out—no money,\nno job, no guanxi. And there was no face for Don the next year, when, after\npaying a substantial fine, he returned to the college and resumed his studies.\nThat was the other side of Shenzhen—but there weren’t so many legends\nabout the people who failed. Sometimes you heard about nice Sichuanese\ngirls who turned into prostitutes after running out of money, but mostly you\nheard about the ones who had succeeded.\nAnne sent Adam and me vivid letters from Shenzhen, describing the\n“talent markets” where she had to pay ten yuan to talk with prospective\nemployers. It was a stressful and expensive place to look for a job, and soon\nAnne, who was there with her sister, had spent all of her savings in the\nmarkets. At last they pooled resources to send Anne’s sister into the talent\nmarkets, where she tracked down an interview for a position that called for",
        "English fluency. Anne went to the interview and got the job. She asked for\ntwelve hundred yuan a month; the boss countered with nine hundred; and\nAnne, who had already been rejected enough times, accepted the offer.\nShe had never left the Fuling area before graduation, and now suddenly\nshe was working on her own in what was perhaps the most exciting city in\nChina. Not long after she started her job, she wrote me a letter describing her\nearly days at the office:\nDuring the first two days, only one girl in our office showed her\nhospitality; others acted as if they didn’t notice my exist. I felt very\nlonely. I thought of you—you must have felt lonely in your early stay in\nFuling. I encouraged myself to try to show my anxiety to make friends\nwith them. My efforts ended in success; I was took as one of them soon.\nIn our office there are only eight people. Except the boss (an old man),\nothers are all young girls. They are from three different provinces. Lulu,\nLuyun, Xuli, Lily are from Jiangxi Province; Yi Xiaoying from Hunan,\nLinna from Sichuan. Lulu is the most beautiful, able and shortest girl,\nwho is liked by everyone. Luyun is very kind, who reminds me of\nAirane [a Fuling classmate]. Xuli is a classical beauty, most private\ntelephones from boys are for her. But I don’t like her very much, for her\nword sometimes hurtful. Lily is the other secretary, who came two days\nearlier than me. She leaves us an impression of stupid and irresponsible.\nSo she is not very popular in the office. Xiaoying is the fatest girl\nconcerning much about losing weight. She is very good at computer but\npoor in English. We have an oral contract that she teaches me how to\nuse computer and I teach her English. Linna is the one I can speak\nSichuan dialect with. But Sichuan dialect is so understandable by\neveryone that we don’t have a sense of superiority when speaking it.\nOh! Till now, you still don’t know what our company does. Our\ncompany was just moved from Taiwan several months before. It acts in\nthe field of exporting fashion, costume and shell jewelry. My job is\nkeeping touch with our customers by letters or faxes, receiving purchase\norders, giving order to factories and finding the best company to ship\nproducts to our customers. Since I’m not familiar with my work, Lulu\nhelps me a lot these days.",
        "IF YOU DIDN’T GO TO SHENZHEN, you could make money quickly in\nthe stock market. The Fuling exchange office was next to South Mountain\nGate, a huge room with rows of chairs where people sat and watched the\nstock listings on an enormous digital screen. For a while I used to go there,\nhoping to practice Chinese with the people, but none of them ever talked.\nThey simply stared at the money as it raced across the boards.\nMany of my friends had invested, despite the expensive registration\ndeposit of thirty thousand yuan. This fee was refundable after a certain period\nof time, but it was an enormous amount and people usually pooled their\nresources and registered as a group. Teacher Liao had investments through\none of her relatives, and the family at the Students’ Home had invested\nmoney through Huang Xiaoqiang’s sister. One afternoon they took Huang\nKai to the exchange, because every night the child became excited and\nshouted “Stock!” repeatedly when the ticker appeared on television. But\nwhen confronted with the market’s reality—the crowds of people, the\nflashing billboard, the noise and lights and energy of the place—he burst into\ntears and cried inconsolably until they returned home, where the familiar\nportrait of Chairman Mao decorated the living-room wall.\nOn January 9 of 1998, which was a Friday, my friend Scott Kramer called\nfrom New York and warned me that the Chinese stock market was under\nserious speculation. He worked in emerging markets on Wall Street, and for\nmy sake he always kept an eye on China.\nThat day I had class with Teacher Liao, and I told her it might be a good\ntime to take her money out of the market. She shrugged it off—what did I\nknow?\nThe following Monday, the Shanghai Index fell 9.1 percent and the\nShenzhen Index dropped 7.8 percent. It was one of the worst days in the\nhistory of the Chinese markets, and Teacher Liao lost a thousand yuan. The\nfamily at the Students’ Home lost nearly as much. They told me about it\nwhile I ate lunch, and Huang Kai picked up one of the words and babbled it\nover and over again. “Diele, diele,” he said. “It fell, it fell.” Within a week\nthe family had sold all their stock.\nThe next time I had class with Teacher Liao, she grinned sheepishly as\nshe walked into my office.",
        "“You were right,” she said. “I forgot all about what you said until that\nMonday, when I got home and watched television. But by then it was too late\n—they had already closed the market. Afterward I told my husband that you\nhad known it would happen.”\n“I didn’t know anything,” I said. “But my friend in America thought it\nmight fall. That’s his job and he understands it very well.”\n“We should have listened.”\nI asked her how much she had lost, and she told me. She said everybody\nwas losing money; two years ago the stocks went up all the time but now\nthere hadn’t been a good month all year. I told her I’d keep her updated on\nKramer’s tips.\nANNE HAD ACCESS TO THE COMPANY PHONES in Shenzhen, and\nsometimes at night she called Adam or me. One evening she phoned and\nreported that she had gotten a raise to one thousand yuan, and I congratulated\nher. As time passed, I would find this to be one of the most satisfying aspects\nof teaching, because former students occasionally called to report milestones\nof adulthood and independence. Often these benchmarks had to do with\nmoney: a new raise, a new apartment, a new beeper. Once a student called to\ntell me that he had acquired a cell phone. He told me about the cell phone for\na few minutes and then he mentioned, in an offhand way, that he had also\ngotten engaged.\nI told Anne that now her salary was as high as mine, which made her\nlaugh. But on the phone she sounded a little funny, and finally I asked if\nsomething was wrong.\n“The company has an agent in Hong Kong,” she said slowly. “He often\ncomes here to Shenzhen. He is an old man, and he likes me.”\n“What do you mean by that?”\nSilence. I tried again. “Why does he like you?”\n“Because I am fat.” She giggled nervously on the phone. She was a pretty\ngirl and I knew that she had gained a little weight since graduation, and in\nsome ways this made her even prettier.\n“What do you mean when you say that he likes you because of that?” I\nasked.",
        "Silence.\n“Does he want you to be his girlfriend?”\n“Perhaps.”\n“Is he married?”\n“He is divorced. He has small children in Taiwan, where he is from. But\nhe usually works in Hong Kong.”\n“How often does he come to Shenzhen?”\n“Twice a month.”\n“Is it a big problem?”\n“He always finds a way to be with me.”\n“Will you leave the job?”\n“He says he will help me find a job in Hong Kong if I want one. The\nsalaries are much higher there, you know. He says I can make much more\nmoney if I go to Hong Kong.”\nI breathed deeply and thought about how to handle this. “That sounds like\na very bad idea,” I said slowly. “If you want another job, you should not ask\nhim for help. That will only cause big problems in the future.”\n“I know. I think I would never do that.”\n“You should try to avoid him.”\n“I do,” she said. “And I tell my coworkers to always be with me if he is\nthere.”\n“Do you think it is a big problem?”\n“Not now.”\n“Well, if it becomes a big problem, you should leave the job. That can be\na very bad situation.”\n“I know,” she said. “I don’t think that will be necessary. But it is not such\na good job, and if I have to leave, I will.”\nONE OF TEACHER KONG’S DISTANT COUSINS had been kidnapped\nand sold into marriage in Anhui province. The woman wasn’t a close relative\nof Teacher Kong, but they shared the same family name. We talked about her\nduring a tutorial in which we discussed fanmai renkou, people who were\nbought and sold for money.\nI asked if the woman had been able to escape her husband, and Teacher",
        "Kong said that they still lived together. She had been sold in the mid-1980s;\nnow they had been married for more than a decade.\n“She was relatively satisfied,” Teacher Kong said. “Her husband had\nmoney.”\nTo a certain degree this struck me as obvious—after all, he had purchased\nthe woman. But apart from finances, wasn’t she angry about the violation?\n“I’m not sure, because I don’t know her well,” Teacher Kong said. “But I\nthink she wanted to leave Fengdu. She was from a very poor part of the\ncountryside, and you know that it is difficult for a woman to leave a place\nlike that. Usually they aren’t taken by force—they’re tricked. Somebody\nmight promise them a job somewhere else, and once they arrive they’re sold\nas a bride. They’re far from home and there’s nothing they can do. I think\nthat’s what happened to my cousin.”\n“So she never came back?”\n“After about five years she did. At first she was very ashamed—too\nashamed to write. But after a while she got back in contact, and finally she\nmade a visit home. Now she’s been back a few times. She likes her husband.\nQuite a few of them turn out like that, if the women are from very poor places\nlike my cousin. The only serious problems are with the women who are sold\nto idiots, or cripples, or old men. They’re not happy if they have a husband\nlike that, of course. That’s when there’s trouble, but as long as there’s enough\nmoney most of the women aren’t too upset.”\n“Usually they’re taken far from home?”\n“Yes, and sometimes that’s a problem—the husband will live in a very\nremote area, and the women are watched so they can’t get away. Some of\nthem are illiterate and can’t write home, or they don’t know how to travel\nback. Does that happen much in America?”\n“No,” I said. “That doesn’t happen very much in America. I’ve never\nknown anybody who was bought or sold.”\n“It’s not so common anymore in China, either. It was more common in\nthe 1980s, just after the Reform and Opening started. Now it doesn’t happen\nso much, but in the remote areas I’ve heard that sometimes it’s still a\nproblem.”",
        "EVERY YEAR AT THE BEGINNING of the American section of my\nliterature course, we read the Declaration of Independence, which was in the\ntextbooks. The Chinese publisher had included the Declaration because it\nsmacked of revolution, which was always an appropriate subject for Chinese\nstudents. They never would have included the American Constitution or the\nBill of Rights.\nI assigned the chapter, and then I asked the students to write their own\nDeclarations, asserting independence from something that limited them.\nNearly all of the boys declared independence from the college, although a\nfew responses were different. Marx, who was true to his name, declared\nindependence from Money:\nWe are slaves of the money, all of us, this is the case. But we all know\nclearly that money is only the thing that people create. We want our\nfood, coat, car, and all of the things not controled by the money. We\ndon’t want to fight against money, because at least money has given us\nsome convenience. But its harm is much bigger than the remittance. We\nmust get rid of money. Money is the tyrant of our society. We must\nthrow it off.\nNone of the girls wrote about money, and few of them declared\nindependence from the college. Many wanted to be free from their parents—\nthey wrote about how their mothers read their diaries and prevented them\nfrom choosing their friends freely, especially their boyfriends. Quite a few of\nthe girls declared independence from men entirely. One student wrote:\nThe laws and God give each man equality. They give us freedom from\nwant, freedom from fear, freedom of speech, freedom of loving, and so\non. However, my boyfriend almost abolishes the freedom of my speech\nand deed, the freedom of my loving.\nHe is an all-controlling person. He and I are open-minded. He could\nspeak with anyone he would like to. He could play with his “little\nsisters.” He could also laugh and laugh with them. I don’t know around\nhim, how many “little sisters” he has. But he hates my doing these.",
        "Before our love, I had had many friends. I liked to chat with them, to go\nfor an outing, to have a joke with them, etc. At that time, I don’t know\nwhat’s the meaning of mental pain. I was like a happy bird. Now, when\nhe saws me talk with boys, he must snap at me. Even more, he doesn’t\nshow due respect for my feelings. I lost my friends. I am so alone that\nmy characteristic also changes. Sometimes for trifles, I might fly into a\nrage. I can’t find own original image. I can’t bear his rudeness. So I\ndecide to leave him forever. When he knows my idea, he threatens me.\nHe says, “If you leave me, I will kill you.” My dear! What can I do?\nI still believe laws and God give each man equality. Now I’ll declare\nloudly that I must be independent! Freedom and independence are more\nimportant than anything else in the world, including love!\nNOT LONG AFTER my telephone conversation with Anne, she wrote in a\nletter that the Hong Kong man had cooled in his pursuit of her. She was\nsatisfied with the job, and now a former classmate from Fuling was coming\nto Shenzhen to try her luck. They were to live together, along with Anne’s\nolder sister.\nAnne was always concerned about her sister, who had a tendency to\nbounce from job to job. The last time Adam had spoken with her, she had\ndescribed her sister’s current job, which sounded more or less like part of a\npyramid scheme. Those scams were very common in Shenzhen, as well as\nmany other places in China, and Anne’s sister had naturally found a position\ntoward the bottom of the pyramid. Adam and I both suggested as tactfully as\npossible that Anne should encourage her sister to find a different line of work\n—pyramids were collapsing all over China, and the government was\ncurrently cracking down on them. Anne gave me an update in her letter:\nMy sister’s situation is getting better now. Frankly, she is more\ncapable than me. What she lacks most is luck. Although these days, she\nhas done very bad in getting money, she is successful making friends\nand having experience, which we think will be good for whatever job\nshe may have in future. But my parents, especially my mother doesn’t\nthink so. They are getting worried about her, because she is already",
        "twenty-five years old now, but still has neither a stable job nor a\nboyfriend. It’s a very funny situation—when they got know that I had a\nboyfriend, they were so upset, even became angry. As I was still a little\ngirl in their eyes—three or four years makes so big a difference!\nI have read every letter (two total) from you for many times; it has\nbeen a great pleasure to “talk” with an elder man who can always come\nup with wise ideas. My father may be a wise man, but I’d rather act like\na spoiled child before him; we seldom talk seriously.\nA couple of weeks later Anne called from work. I asked her about the\nHong Kong man, and she laughed.\n“He likes all women he sees,” she said. “Because of that he is not such a\nproblem.”\nShe told me her job was going well, and I asked how her sister was doing.\n“She is fine.”\n“Does she have a new job?”\n“Yes. She answers the telephone.”\n“What do you mean by that?”\n“People call her,” Anne explained, “and she talks to them.”\n“She has conversations with them?”\n“Yes.”\n“Do many people call?”\n“Yes.”\n“What do they talk about?”\n“About troubles.”\n“What kind of troubles?”\n“About affections!” She giggled after saying this and there was a pause.\n“Does your sister like the job?”\n“I think she likes it.”\n“How is the salary?”\n“She makes six hundred a month,” said Anne. “But if more people call,\nshe makes more money.”\n“Who calls—are they men or women?”\n“I think half are men, half are women. There are many people who call.”\n“Why do they call?”",
        "“Everyone here in Shenzhen has many troubles.”\n“Why is that?”\n“There are many troubles about affections. Some people say there is no\nreal love in Shenzhen. People are too busy with earning money to exist.”\nDURING OUR FIRST YEAR IN FULING, Adam’s best freshman student\nhad been a girl named Janelle. She was so far ahead of the others that there\nwas no comparison, and something about this intellectual distance also set\nher apart socially. She had no friends in the class and spent her time alone,\noften talking with Adam or me to practice her English. At the end of the\nschool year, she seemed depressed, and then for some unknown reason she\nwent home early, missing her final exams.\nAt the start of the second year, Adam had class for the first time and\ncalled roll. Everybody was there except for Janelle, and Adam asked if she\nwas sick. A few students shook their heads. Nobody said anything.\n“Will she be here later?” Adam asked.\n“No,” said Shannon, who was the class monitor. “She will not come back\nthis year.”\n“Why not?”\n“She is dead,” Shannon said, and then he laughed. It was a nervous and\nhumorless sound, the sort of Chinese laugh that was simply a reaction to an\nuncomfortable situation. It wasn’t difficult to distinguish these laughs from\nnormal ones, but nevertheless they always sent shivers down a waiguoren’s\nspine. The students had their heads down and Adam quickly changed the\ntopic. On that day class was a long two hours.\nThe subject was difficult to broach and we never heard much about it,\nbecause none of the students had known Janelle well. All they could tell us\nwas that during the summer she had jumped off a bridge in her hometown.\nWhen the Chinese commit suicide, it’s common for them to jump off things\n—bridges, buildings, cliffs. Sometimes in the countryside they eat pesticide.\nThey tend to do a much more thorough job of killing themselves than\nAmericas do, especially American women, who often take pills and are saved\nby having their stomachs pumped.\nChinese women are more likely to commit suicide than Chinese men.",
        "More than half of the female suicides in the world take place in China, where\nthe suicide rate for women is nearly five times the world average. China is\nthe only country on earth in which more women kill themselves than men.\nIn Fuling there were plenty of signs that things could be difficult for\nwomen, and Adam and I had strange experiences with women who seemed\nunbalanced. During our first year, a freshman girl used to lurk outside\nAdam’s apartment, accusing him of loving her. Adam tried to reason with\nher, asking why she believed this, and sometimes she said that she had heard\nit from her body. Other times she invented a story about how Dean Fu had\ncalled a meeting and told all of the students about Adam’s interest in her.\nOnce she angrily accused Adam of being too timid to pursue her, and she said\nthat, like all Americans, he was a coward and a liar.\nI had my own troubles with a woman named Miss Ou, who worked in a\ndowntown department store. She was in her mid-forties, unmarried, and she\ntelephoned at strange hours—at six in the morning she would invite me to\ncome and see her. She gave me gifts: chopsticks, books, hand-knit sweaters.\nShe was a kind, harmless woman, and at the beginning I tried to be friendly,\nbut soon I was overwhelmed by her desperate loneliness. Every two or three\nweeks she sent me poetry and brief sayings that she copied out of English\ntextbooks or translated herself. “We open up the future dream together!” she\nonce wrote. “Harmonious family condition is the fatal term of the success of\ncareer.”\nOccasionally she sent me longer letters, like the one entitled “Keep the\nTrees of Love Green Forever”:\nYou should fully realize that woman is the unexhausted source of the\nstrength of man. She can affect him, give him self confidence, lead him\nup, make him exciting, she can make timid brave, make weakness\nstrong. It all depends on how the woman excavate the great potential\npower of her own.\nGood woman is a school, she will affect, encourage, and model you\n(man) with a kind of magical spirit. Benefit you all your life. Man\nshould enter this school to refine himself. The man who has ideal is the\nmost powerful one.",
        "While it seemed that Fuling women were far more likely than men to feel\nisolated and frustrated, I had trouble untangling the reasons behind this\nunhappiness. Gender relations were hard to understand very fully, because\nthese were sensitive, private issues and I was an outsider. But even from my\ndistance I sensed an enormous gap between the experiences of local women\nand men.\nIn particular, I noticed that they had vastly different relationships to\nmoney. In my mind, money was a male quality in Fuling—it was something\nthat I naturally associated with men, and to some degree it was connected to\nthe standard dress code that represented local masculinity. City men almost\nnever wore shorts, regardless of how hot it was, and in cool weather they\ndressed carefully in Western-style suits with the tailors label left prominently\non the sleeve. In hot weather they wore bright silk shirts and thin polyester\nslacks. They clipped beepers and cell phones prominently to their belts,\nwhich were wrapped one and a half times around their narrow waists. They\ncarried their money in fat black leather purses. They were finicky about shoes\n—most men wore dark loafers, which they kept well polished. This was part\nof the routine when I had dinner with a group of well-to-do male friends in\ntown: first we would have our shoes shined, all of us sitting on a row of\ncurbside stools, and then we would go to a restaurant.\nSome Fuling men allowed their pinkie nails to grow a full two inches,\nbecause this was a sign that they didn’t do manual labor. A number of my\nmale students had nails like this, which looked absurdly feminine on hands\nthat clearly had been toughened by work in the fields. But none of the\nstudents planned on returning to the peasant life, and their nails were a clear\nindication that their lives were moving forward. Most of the long-nailed men\nin Fuling were of this transitional social class; they tended to be former\npeasants who were finding success as cab drivers, clerks, or small\nentrepreneurs. The truly rich rarely grew out their nails, because their wealth\nwas already obvious enough from their expensive suits and cell phones.\nThe pinkie nails, like so many male accouterments, represented money—\nindeed, men in banks and shops occasionally used their elongated nails to\ncount out bills. Fuling women also had their share of accessories that showed\nthey were from the upper class, but on the whole these indications were less\nbluntly obvious and materialistic than those of the men. Upper-class males",
        "even wielded their leather purses in a far more showy manner than the\nwomen ever did. When one of these men paid a bill, he would ostentatiously\nopen his purse, allowing bystanders to see a fat wad of cash.\nIt was clear that men controlled most of the money—they were quicker to\nearn it, quicker to spend it, and quicker to talk about it. They had more\nopportunities than the women, who were less likely to go into business or\nfind lucrative independent jobs like driving a cab. In the end, money simply\nmeant more to the men. I had trouble imagining what Fuling men had been\nlike before Reform and Opening, because money struck me as such a\nfundamental part of their identity.\nAnd it could be a distinctly tedious part, at least in my eyes. After a year\nin the city, I found that I least enjoyed associating with one particular\nsocioeconomic group: the young moneyed male. There were exceptions, of\ncourse, but when I tried to define the average person from this group, I saw a\nman driven by a set of goals and aspirations that were so narrow they became\na sort of caricature of showy masculinity. He tended to be passionate about\nacquiring beepers and cell phones, and he worked hard to accumulate\nincreasingly advanced videodisc players and karaoke machines. He smoked\nMagnificent Sound cigarettes constantly. He tended to be loud, and he was\nvery conscious of face, carrying himself with a certain swagger. On\nweekends he sometimes engaged in senseless drinking competitions with his\nmale friends, challenging each other to shot after shot of baijiu. If he wanted\nsome illicit excitement, he found prostitutes at a karaoke bar or a beauty\nparlor.\nI realized that this was an unfairly narrow prejudice, and during my\nsecond year in Fuling I became friends with several wealthy young men who\ndidn’t match this stereotype. But nevertheless I found that it was easiest to\nmake friends from the middle and lower classes. I was far more comfortable\nwith somebody like Teacher Kong, who was thoughtful, interesting, and not\nin the least materialistic, and most of my boy students lacked the swagger of\nthe Fuling rich. Even a small entrepreneur like Huang Xiaoqiang, who clearly\nspent a lot of time thinking about money, wasn’t inclined to present the sort\nof macho facade that was standard among relatively wealthy men. In fact, this\nfacade was often only skin deep, and it merely took time to penetrate beyond\nit; but in the end I didn’t have the patience. Apart from a few exceptions, I\nessentially wrote off that entire class of people.",
        "I also developed these prejudices from looking at my own behavior as a\nman in Fuling, especially when I participated in the macho routines that\nplayed such a large role in local upper-class male lives. During our second\nyear, Adam and I both became tired of the banquet routine—the senseless\ncompetitive drinking, the constant bullying, the baijiu strategy. It had been\nentertaining during the first year, largely because we had so few social\noutlets, and some of the banquets were among my most humorous memories.\nBut they were also some of the most embarrassing. For Christmas of my\nsecond year, the college held a banquet that coincided with a visiting\ndelegation of cadres from Chongqing. As far as alcohol consumption went, it\nwas hard to imagine a more auspicious coincidence than cadres and\nChristmas—that was like having nine planets line up at exactly the same\ntime. From the moment I first heard about this event I knew that it would be\nugly.\nThere were more than thirty cadres at the banquet, and by the time the\nparade of holiday toasts was finished, Adam and I were shouting Sichuanese\nswear words and firing toy plastic pellet guns at each other from across the\nrestaurant. At least this was what I later heard; I had no memory of the last\ntwo hours and only knew what Sunni and Noreen told me (they also handled\ntheir share of toasts on that evening, although most of the attention had been\nfocused on Adam and me).\nIn another culture I would have woken up mortified, but that was the least\nof my concerns the next morning. I was hungover, and badly bruised, but I\nknew there was no point in making apologies, because none was expected.\nProbably every single cadre had made a jackass of himself at some banquet\nwithin the past year, and without question their enjoyment of the event had\nbeen heightened by Adam and me being out of control. That was where the\npellet guns came from, after all—a visiting foreign friend suggested the gift\nand the cadres instantly recognized their potential as a Christmas present.\nSomebody bought the guns on the street, loaded them, and put them in our\nhands.\nAlcohol was always a viable excuse for bad male behavior in Fuling.\nOnce in my first year I was eating dinner by myself in the college cafeteria\nwhen a group of three drunk physical education students came to my table,\ntaunting and laughing at me. I tried to ignore them, but they just pressed\ncloser, brushing against me while their insults became louder. Finally I stood",
        "up, and for a moment a fight seemed likely, but the cafeteria staff stepped in\nand escorted the students out. But that was all the staff did—they didn’t take\nany names, or alert the college authorities. They made sure the students left,\nand then they apologized to me and explained that the three young men had\nbeen drunk. In their view, that was all that needed to be said—the drunk\nstudents weren’t responsible for what they did.\nWhile male drinking occasionally led to aggression, I mostly disliked its\ntediousness. When I looked back at the most vivid banquet of my first year,\nwhen the literary magazine had recruited me to write my Dickens essay, I\nsaw it as a humorous incident but also as one that was full of wasted\nopportunities. The table had been full of intelligent, well-educated people,\nand yet virtually all of the evening’s energy had been focused on making\nTeacher Sai drink when he did not want to. It reminded me of high school\nparties, except these men were in their forties and fifties. After the Christmas\nbanquet in our second year, Adam and I finally took the original Peace Corps\nadvice and refused to participate anymore in the competitive drinking.\nBut this was a decision that we had to make ourselves, because nobody\nexpected us to behave responsibly and not act like drunken fools. In the end,\nthis was probably my strongest prejudice toward men in Fuling, and\nespecially upper-class men—on the average, I didn’t see their lives being\nshaped by particularly high expectations. It was like any extremely male-\ndominated culture in which men are given more leeway than is healthy, and\nin Fuling it became even more pronounced when male pride was swollen\nwith financial success.\nWhile I typically avoided associating with wealthy men, there were\nmoments when I was tempted to extend this prejudice to all young men.\nAgain, this was an attitude that I tried to resist, but to a large degree it was a\nnatural reaction to all of Fuling’s anti-foreigner harassment, which invariably\ncame from young males. Every single day that I spent in the city, people\nshouted at me, and probably less than 5 percent of these catcalls came from\nwomen. Generally it was the result of men trying to be macho: if I saw three\nyoung men walking toward me, I could be almost certain that one of them\nwould shout something at me to impress his friends. In that sense it was\nsimilar to any sort of harassment in America, which typically comes from\nyoung men, but in Fuling it was far more routine.\nIt didn’t take me very long to come to the conclusion that men were far",
        "more likely to give me trouble than women, and I shaped my routines\naccordingly. If I went shopping and saw two people selling the same thing, I\ninvariably went to the woman first, because there was a much lower chance\nthat she would cheat me or mock me. I knew other Peace Corps volunteers\nwho followed the same pattern; it was a prejudice, but one that stemmed from\nexperience.\nAll of these reactions and prejudices made it even more difficult for me to\nsort out gender relations in Fuling. My own life was contradictory: while I\ninstinctively learned to be more wary of males, I nevertheless found that my\nclosest friends were men, and I was far less comfortable associating with\nwomen on a one-to-one basis. If you were a male waiguoren in a small\nSichuan city like Fuling, there were tacit barriers that stood between you and\nthe women, and I avoided crossing these divides because I didn’t want to find\nmyself in trouble. The Peace Corps staff had all but formally recommended\nthat we avoid dating in these small towns, because people were so skittish\nabout waiguoren. But even if there hadn’t been such a recommendation, I\nwould have seen at a glance that such matters would be complicated, and it\nwas something that all of the male Peace Corps volunteers in my group took\nseriously. There were seven single men, and over the course of two years not\none of us had a romantic relationship with a Chinese woman.\nAs a result, local women were always somewhat mysterious and foreign,\nwhich was probably why xiaojie was one of the first Chinese words that\nAdam and I incorporated into our everyday English speech. It meant “miss”\nor “young woman,” but it also conveyed the foreignness of the women in\nFuling, as well as the barrier that we felt because we were waiguoren. In fact\nthis is a term adopted by virtually every foreigner living in China, partly\nbecause young women workers are ubiquitous in certain jobs—as waitresses,\nshop assistants, train attendants—where they are addressed simply as xiaojie.\nBut at the same time there’s a complicated vagueness to this term, because it\ncan also refer to the sort of young women who can be found in karaoke halls\nor suspicious beauty parlors. People in Fuling spoke of san pei xiaojie\n—“three-with girls,” who worked in karaoke halls. Men could drink with\nthem, sing karaoke with them, and dance with them. And for enough money\nsome of the three-with girls would perform a fourth “with,” sleeping with the\ncustomer.\nIt was impossible to define exactly what xiaojie meant, because it",
        "stretched across a broad range of implication. Anne was a xiaojie and so was\nLi Jiali, the prostitute who had pursued me at the teahouse. Xiaojie was a\nvague term, which was appropriate because it was difficult to define exactly\nwhat was expected of young women in a place like Fuling. They weren’t like\nyoung upper-class men, whose aspirations could be neatly summarized, and I\nfound that I had no equivalently simple definition for the average young\nwoman in Fuling. She was expected to marry young and promptly have her\nchild, and yet her childbearing was strictly and legally limited. She was\nexpected to have a job and earn money of her own, but job discrimination\nwas even more severe than in America. Traditional morality was breaking\ndown, but this happened unevenly and in unhealthy ways; prostitution was\nbecoming increasingly common and so were love affairs. I was amazed at\nhow many of my young married friends in the city were cheating on their\nspouses, but divorce still came with a definite stigma for the women\ninvolved.\nWhen a woman had an affair with a married man, people said that she tou\nren, or tou hanzi—“stole men.” There was no equivalent phrase that meant to\nsteal women. If a single man had a romantic relationship with a married\nwoman, people described her as shuixing yanghua—“as fickle as the way the\nwater flows and the willow seed blows.” Again, this phrase couldn’t be\napplied to men; even the language did its part to protect them from being\nblamed for their indiscretions. Other aspects of Chinese were even more\nbluntly sexist. If you wanted to call a woman a bitch, you could say that she\n“stunk three-eight,” because March 8 is International Women’s Day.\nFuling women lived under complicated expectations, and the economic\npressures of Reform and Opening seemed to weigh particularly heavily on\nthem. In the countryside, many of the men had left to work in urban areas,\nand for every stick-stick soldier or construction worker in the city, there was\na peasant wife back at home, tending the farm alone. A total of 66 percent of\nChina’s agricultural workers are female. Social scientists believe that this\nimbalance is partly responsible for the high female suicide rate, which occurs\npredominantly in the countryside. Rarely do these rural deaths seem to be the\nresult of poverty; in fact, most happen within a relatively affluent and well-\neducated class of peasants. Adam’s student Janelle was a textbook example\nof this trend: she wasn’t poor, and she had academic opportunities that were\nunusual for peasant girls. But Janelle’s career path most likely would have",
        "involved returning to her hometown to teach, which probably had been a\ndepressing prospect for somebody so bright. I suspected that she had\nrecognized clearly her own potential, as well as the bleakness of her future: to\nbecome a rural schoolteacher, marry young, raise a child. In the end it was\nmore—or less—than she could bear.\nOf course, things were worse in other parts of the world. Women in\nChina could go much further than in most developing countries; there was no\ncomparison with the Middle East. Also, there had been clear improvements in\nChina, where post-Liberation reforms had made it easier for women to work,\nand the Communists had always campaigned hard against wife-selling while\nsupporting women’s right to divorce. Chinese women were also much better\neducated than ever before—but in a sense this only served to make them\nmore aware of their plight. Like so many aspects of Chinese life, the issue of\nwomen’s independence had reached a transitional stage, and it seemed to be a\nparticularly painful one.\nEverything was further complicated by the influence of traditional\ncollective thinking. The longer I lived in Fuling, the more I was struck by the\nview of the individual—in my opinion, this was the biggest difference\nbetween what I had known in the West and what I saw in Sichuan. For people\nin Fuling, the sense of self seemed largely external; you were identified by\nthe way that others viewed you. That had always been the goal of\nConfucianism, which defined the individual’s place strictly in relation to the\npeople around her: she was somebody’s daughter, somebody else’s wife,\nsomebody else’s mother; and each role had its specific obligations. This was\nan excellent way to preserve social harmony, but once that harmony was\nbroken the lack of self-identity made it difficult to put things back together\nagain. I sensed this whenever I read personal accounts of victimization during\nthe Cultural Revolution, because these stories were surprisingly full of shame\n—one day a person was a good Communist, and the next day the winds\nchanged and he was a mortified Counter-Revolutionary forced into the\n“airplane” stance at a rally, his arms outstretched and bent painfully back.\nThe shift in itself was not so remarkable—irrational political purges\nhappened the world over—but the strange part was that so many of these\nvictims were racked by shame, clearly believing that they were somehow\nflawed. It was like a target of McCarthyism immediately breaking down and\nadmitting that he was wrong, or a Holocaust victim hating herself because",
        "she was indeed a “dirty Jew.” Often it seemed that in China there was no\ninternal compass that was able to withstand these events.\nGroup thought could be a vicious circle—your self-identity came from\nthe group, which was respected even if it became deranged, and thus your\nsense of self could fall apart instantly. There wasn’t a tradition of anchoring\none’s identity to a fixed set of values regardless of what others thought, and\nin certain periods this had contributed to the country’s disasters. The Cultural\nRevolution showed how Chinese society could become completely unhinged,\nbut to a lesser extent there were bound to be problems during any sort of\ntransitional period. And in recent decades nothing had been more disruptive\nto social roles and expectations than Reform and Opening\nGroup mentality seemed particularly troublesome for women, who lived\nunder a strange combination of strictness and uncertainty. When compared to\nmen, their traditional role in Chinese society was much more narrow, but the\nnew economy resulted in frighteningly vague expectations and demands. On\nthe whole these changes were undoubtedly positive, but they were happening\nso quickly that freedom could easily look overwhelming to somebody who\nwas caught in the middle.\nAnd often there wasn’t anywhere to turn for help. Time and time again I\nsaw this with my classes; for the most part they were incredibly close and\nsupportive, but they could be cruelly isolating when a member was somehow\ndifferent. Nobody had ever shown any interest in Janelle, and every class had\nat least one student who seemed alone; more often than not it was a girl.\nBeing different wasn’t liberating, as it sometimes is in America, and this was\nespecially true for women from a peasant background, who were unlikely to\nfeel comfortable ignoring the opinions of others and blazing new ground. The\nresult was that they became outsiders not so much by choice as by helpless\ninclination, which naturally made them feel that they were the ones at fault.\nTo some degree, Anne had been like this. She had never quite fit in with\nthe others, but she was also very bright, socially gifted, and attractive. In the\nend, these qualities gave her enough confidence to ignore certain aspects of\nthe group. But Janelle was only extremely intelligent, which probably served\nto sharpen her sense of isolation.\nOften money lay at the heart of these stresses. Peasant women saw their\nhusbands go off in search of work, gaining financial security but leaving their\nspouses isolated, and sometimes this loneliness destroyed them. Women",
        "could earn money themselves; this was a way of becoming independent, but a\ncareer could also result in the frustration of sexism and the criticism of people\nwho felt that a woman shouldn’t strive in this way. A woman like Anne could\ngo south to Shenzhen, where there was money; but Shenzhen money could be\nearned in many ways. There were xiaojies who worked as secretaries and\nthere were three-with xiaojies. xiaojies like Li Jiali and xiaojies like Anne.\nAll of them were doing whatever they could to earn money. And they were\nsurrounded by plenty of men who had sold their souls long ago, and often the\nwomen had to negotiate this uncertain world alone.\nAT THE END OF THE SEMESTER, before the Chinese New Year, Miss\nOu slipped an envelope under my door. Inside the envelope was a letter, a\ncopy of her health certificate, and five hundred yuan. The letter was in broken\nEnglish:\nDear Pete,\nHow long have to see you, where you has gone recently?\nPlease remember: “First thing first.” Can you tell me. May I help\nyou?\n“Make every-thing risk must rise early.”\n“Take a chance! All life is a chance the man who goes furthest is\ngenerally the one who is willing to do and dare.”\n“Although language isn’t complete interlinked, it isn’t\nmisunderstood to express love.”\n“The best relationships are these which we create at our own\nexpense with our own honesty and understanding.”\nBecause not easy, so we should double cherish.\n“Miracles sometimes occur, but one has to work terribly hard for\nthem.”\n“Bold and mighty forces will come to your aid.”\n“A good wife and health is a man’s best wealth.” “Happiness is\nbeing married to your best friend.”\n“Think more and become wiser.” Your own are wonderful!\nMay I ask a favor of? I sure you able to do something. I’m sorry to",
        "trouble you, I do appreciate your kindly help. Please to my home have\nfood, spend Spring Festival together, shall we? The best of luck to you!\nSincerely,\nOu Xiaomei\nP.S. This is my health certificate.\nThe health certificate noted that she was 1.70 meters tall and weighed\nsixty-seven kilograms. There weren’t any problems with her heart, chest, or\nlungs. Her teeth, nose, and ears were also good. She was listed at thirty years\nof age, which was not true; the certificate was a photocopy of the original and\nobviously this detail had been doctored. But everything else looked accurate.\nOn the upper right corner of the health certificate was a photograph of\nMiss Ou. The picture was at least twenty years old. It was a small black-and-\nwhite snapshot of a much younger Miss Ou wearing heavy-rimmed glasses\nand neatly curled hair. She was smiling in the photograph, a pretty young\nwoman who looked at the camera with confidence.\nThe one-hundred-yuan notes were folded neatly in half. It was more than\nhalf of what Miss Ou made in a month. Even in America it was a good sum,\nsixty bucks, but in Fuling you could eat for two months on five hundred\nyuan. If you had that much money twenty times over, you could buy yourself\na second child.\nI WAS AFRAID OF MISS OU and rarely dealt with her directly. During\nthe first year I had learned that directness only encouraged her; once I asked\nher firmly to stop coming to my apartment at night, and she became very\nexcited and showed up every evening for the next week. Like all of my Miss\nOu stories, it seemed funny when told out of context, but when it happened I\nwas only annoyed and depressed by how desperately unhappy she seemed.\nI took the money to Fei Xiaoyun, who worked in a different section of the\nsame department store as Miss Ou. Fei Xiaoyun was possibly the prettiest\nxiaojie I knew in town, as well as one of the kindest; she had been one of the",
        "first to talk with Adam and me when our Chinese was still bad. I often\nstopped to chat with her when I went into town, and I knew that she would\nunderstand the problem with Miss Ou. I gave her the money and explained\nthe situation.\n“You know that soon it’s the Spring Festival,” Fei Xiaoyun said. “There\nare many Chinese traditions at this time of year, and one of them is to give\npeople money. So that’s probably why she gave it to you—she just wants to\nshow her kindness.”\nYears ago, Fei Xiaoyun had been a student at the college, and because of\nthat the sound of her Mandarin was very pleasant. I listened to her clear tones\nand then I shook my head.\n“During the Spring Festival people give money to children,” I said. “I\nunderstand that tradition. But I’m not a child and you don’t give this kind of\nmoney to an adult. Would it be appropriate if I gave you five hundred yuan\nbecause you’re my friend?”\n“No,” she said. “That wouldn’t be appropriate.”\n“It’s the same way with this money. I think it’s very strange and it\nembarrasses me.”\n“Yes,” she said, sighing. “It is a little strange.”\nThat was what I liked the most about Fei Xiaoyun—she didn’t feel the\nneed to lie to me just because I was a waiguoren. She had enough sympathy\nfor Miss Ou to try to defend her, but at the same time she understood where I\nwas coming from. Sadly she looked at the bills in the envelope.\n“Will you please help me and give that back to Miss Ou?” I asked.\n“Yes. I’ll be sure to do that.”\n“You can tell her that I’m sorry I can’t accept it. But please don’t\nencourage her—I don’t want her to bother me anymore. I don’t want to be\nrude, but I don’t want her to call me or come to my apartment again.”\n“I understand. I’ll try to tell her that.” But I could see that Fei Xiaoyun\nknew it was hopeless. Miss Ou was one of those who had slipped beyond the\npale, and there wasn’t much that you could do about people like that. I\nassumed that whenever I left Fuling for good there would be some kind of\nminor hassle with Miss Ou, which was precisely the way it would happen.\nBut standing there in the department store I didn’t worry too much about the\nfuture. In Fuling I always dealt with problems one at a time, and right now\nthe most important issue was to give the money back.",
        "I thanked Fei Xiaoyun and wished her a happy Spring Festival. She\nsmiled, placing the envelope in her desk, and a couple weeks later she\nreported that she had returned it successfully. I put Miss Ou’s health\ncertificate in a folder where it could be forgotten. But sometimes I found\nmyself thinking about the old photograph, and I wondered why the young\nwoman had never married, and what had happened to make her the way she\nwas today. For some reason I never threw the photograph away.",
        "THE TEACHER\n“EVERYBODY NEEDS SOME KIND OF FAITH,” says Kong Ming.\n“Whether it’s religion, or Capitalist Democracy, or Communism—regardless\nof what the faith is, everybody needs something. My faith is the Communist\nParty. I first wanted to join when I was a college student, but at that time I\nwasn’t accepted.”\nTeacher Kong is a Party Member and a former peasant and a current\ninstructor of Ancient Chinese Literature in the Chinese department of Fuling\nTeachers College. He is thirty-three years old, and there are a few streaks of\nsilver in his black hair. He has a soft smile that is shadowed by the barest hint\nof a mustache on his upper lip. He knows a great deal about Han Dynasty\npoetry, and his three-year-old son has the given name Songtao, which means\n“waves of pines”: the sound a pine forest makes when the wind blows.\n“It’s a common phrase in Chinese poetry,” Teacher Kong explains. “It\nwas also used once by Shelley—I read it in translation. There’s a poem he\nwrote about a forest, where he describes the trees making that same sound. I\nthink the forest was in Italy but I’m not certain.”\nThere are only 58 million Party Members in all of China—less than 5\npercent of the population. For more than a decade, Teacher Kong was\ninterested in joining, but it wasn’t until last year that he was finally accepted,\nafter a formal application and a series of interviews and evaluations that took\nmonths to complete. “In the past they used to look more carefully at your\nhome and your family,” he says. “Your background was very important. But\nthat’s not the way it is now—they look at your ideas instead, which is better.\n“I think the basic goals of Communism—to help the poor, to make things\nequal—I think those are good goals. The Party certainly has problems, of\ncourse, and some people join for selfish reasons. They want more power, and\nafter they become Party Members they only care about themselves. That’s\nnot good—that’s why we have corruption, because a few people only care",
        "about themselves. And if the Communist Party gets worse and worse, of\ncourse the common people won’t believe in it. This is the biggest problem\nright now. But I believe that most people still support the Party, and I\ncertainly agree with its ideas. There always will be some problems, but the\nfundamental goals are good.”\nONE OF THE FUNDAMENTAL GOALS of the Chinese Communist\nParty has always been stability for the average citizen, which traditionally has\nbeen maintained through the system of state-run work units. Teacher Kong’s\ndanwei is the college, and as a result his life has none of the scramble and\nuncertainty of the entrepreneur. His three-room apartment is owned and\nmaintained by the college, which rents it for roughly thirty yuan a month—a\nsum so small that its payment is essentially a formality. The college also\nprovides Teacher Kong with health insurance, as well as a retirement\npension. At less than eight hundred yuan, his monthly salary isn’t high, but\nthe big perk is security, because it’s unheard-of for the college to fire an\nemployee. Teacher Kong has what Americans would call tenure, except that\ntraditionally in Communist China such tenure has been given the moment\nyou start your job, and it has been given to everybody who works for a state\ndanwei: teachers, government officials, post office employees, train\nattendants, dock laborers, factory workers. Under Chinese Communism, all\nof them have job security—“the iron rice bowl.”\nBut already this term is slipping into the past tense, and people in Fuling\ntend to use it in one of two ways. Usually it is heavy with irony, as locals\nemphasize a wasteful system that needs further reform; but there are still\nthose who use it nostalgically as they describe something comfortable that is\nsteadily disappearing. The way this term is used depends on where one stands\nin the danwei system, and increasingly the government is adopting the more\ncritical viewpoint of the iron rice bowl. As a result, no rice bowl is entirely\niron, and no danwei is without reform, and never is Socialism without those\nChinese Characteristics that are developing into a strange marriage of\nCommunism and Capitalism, constantly shifting and redefining the\nparameters of lives like Teacher Kong’s.\nThe first major change will hit him later this year, in June of 1998, when",
        "his apartment will be privatized. No longer will he enjoy the formality of a\nthirty-yuan rent payment; instead, the apartment’s fifty-four square meters\nwill be sold to him for a little more than ten thousand yuan. It’s a good price\n—but nevertheless a lot of money for a man who makes eight hundred yuan a\nmonth, and whose wife makes even less as a freelance photographer. There\nis, of course, the possibility that the apartment’s value will rise, providing\nTeacher Kong with a profit in the long run—but nothing in the past has\ntaught him to see an apartment as an investment. Nobody in Fuling speaks of\nmortgages and refinancing, and it’s unheard of for a common citizen to get a\nloan from a bank. To make a big purchase, you pay from your own savings,\nor you borrow from family and friends—or, if the money can’t be found, you\ndon’t buy at all.\nOther cracks are spreading across the iron bowl. Already the government\nhas decided that the danwei insurance system will be reformed. The details of\nthis change have yet to be determined, but probably Fuling’s teachers will\nhave to buy their own policies from China’s fledgling insurance companies.\nAnd soon Teacher Kong and his wife, Xu Lijia, will have to deal with the\nissue of schooling. Elementary schools in the East River district charge the\nstandard fees—more than one hundred yuan per semester in tuition, along\nwith book and uniform charges. Such expenses are not difficult to bear, but\nthe quality of public education in Fuling has started to vary widely, because\nschools with good reputations can charge higher tuition fees, thus paying\nhigher salaries to keep top-rate teachers. The East River institutions are\nslipping in this competitive environment, and most teachers at the college\nchoose to send their children to downtown schools. But such transfers are\nincreasingly expensive—a few years ago it cost eight thousand yuan to\nchange districts, and now the one-time fee has leaped to twelve thousand.\nHow much higher will it be in three years, when Kong Songtao is ready for\nschool? And is it worth the money? Are there other Characteristics that will\ncrop up in the once-stable world of the Socialist danwei, leading to more\ndifficult decisions for the family? And will these changes ever reach the point\nwhere Teacher Kong no longer speaks of Communism as a xinyang, a faith?\nBUT EVEN AMID THESE CHANGES, Teacher Kong is not particularly",
        "worried. Decisions will be made when necessary; in the meantime, he teaches\nancient Chinese literature and watches his son grow up. This equanimity has\nnothing to do with Teacher Kong’s status as a Party Member, committed to\nthe government’s policies. Instead, he is calm for the same reason that so\nmany other Chinese are strangely placid in the midst of changes that seem\noverwhelming to outsiders. Quite simply, he has seen far worse.\n“When I was a boy we didn’t have enough to eat,” says Teacher Kong.\n“Especially in 1972 and 1973—those were very bad years. Part of it was that\nwe lived in a remote place where the land wasn’t very good, but also there\nwere some problems associated with the Cultural Revolution—problems with\nproduction and agricultural methods. It was a little better later in the 1970s,\nbut still it wasn’t too good. We never ate meat; I was always hungry. Every\nday we ate rice gruel, and we only had a little bit of that. Rarely did we have\nsalt. We ate weeds, wildflowers, pine needles—I’ve eaten all those things.\n“My mother died when I was five, after she gave birth to my sister. Of\ncourse, we didn’t have milk or anything like that to help the baby, who died\nas well. I don’t remember that. But at the age of ten my father died, which I\ndo remember. He got sick suddenly, a very bad cold, and in three days he was\ndead.\n“After that, things were even worse. My grandfather wasn’t strong\nenough to work, and I was too young to do much, so my uncle had to support\nall of us. At that time the Production Team in that village was very bad, and\nthey weren’t of any help. Later, things improved and they were able to assist\nus, but for many years it was terrible.”\nAll of Kong Ming’s early life took place in the mountains outside\nFengdu, a town that nowadays has about thirty thousand residents. From his\nchildhood home it took an hour by foot to reach the nearest road, which was\nthree hours by rough bus ride from Fengdu, and as a result Kong Ming never\nsaw the town until he was fourteen years old. He helped his uncle farm the\nland, where they grew wheat and corn on the slopes, rice in the paddies, and\nvegetables where they could. “The work didn’t seem hard back then,” he\nsays, “but it would be hard now, because I’m not used to it anymore.” He\nlooks at his hands and smiles, for now they are the hands of a teacher—ink-\nstained and soft, the dirt and calluses long gone.\n“I go to the countryside now,” he says, “and I can’t believe how hard the\nwork looks, even around the suburbs of Fuling, where the peasants are",
        "relatively well off. I can’t believe I used to live in a place like that. And I see\nthe students here at the college, most of whom are from peasant families, and\nI want to tell them that they shouldn’t waste their parents’ money. So many\nof our students are from backgrounds like mine, but they’ve already forgotten\nhow hard the work is. On weekends they go out and waste so much money.”\nOnly a few of his middle-school classmates made it to high school, and\nnone of the others tested well enough to go to college. He was admitted to\nSichuan Teachers College, a four-year institution in Chengdu that is the top\nteachers college in the province. After graduating in 1988, he taught in a\nFengdu trade school for six years, and then he was offered a job in Fuling.\nAlmost anybody in America who has made a rise like Teacher Kong’s\nwould be full of the confidence—and perhaps the arrogance—of the self-\nmade man, but it is characteristically Chinese that such pride is completely\nabsent. He rarely talks about his background, and he never emphasizes its\ndifficulty, because he knows that things easily could have been worse.\n“My family never had any trouble during the Cultural Revolution,” he\nsays, when asked about political problems. “We were too poor. After\nLandlords, there were three types of peasants: Rich Peasants, Middle\nPeasants, and Poor Peasants. We were very poor—when you were as poor as\nwe were, you didn’t have anything to worry about during the Cultural\nRevolution. As long as you didn’t steal something, or kill somebody, or\ncommit another crime, there wasn’t anything to worry about. Nobody in my\nfamily was persecuted.\n“I can remember some of the village meetings at the end of the Cultural\nRevolution, in 1974 and 1975. I didn’t really understand, of course, because I\nwas only in elementary school, but I remember them clearly. They would\ntake a Landlord, or maybe a Capitalist Roader—usually somebody who had\nbeen trying to sell firewood or vegetables—and they would have a meeting to\ncriticize him. He’d stand like this.”\nTeacher Kong demonstrates: feet together, waist bent slightly, head\nbowed so that his chin is tucked against his chest. For a few seconds he\nstands completely still, and then he laughs and continues the story.\n“They didn’t do the airplane so much. Mostly they had to stand like this,\nand if they didn’t bow their head far enough, the people would force them\ndown. I remember one older man in the village who had been a Landlord. At\nall the meetings they made him stand for hours like that, with his head",
        "bowed. He would shift his head to the side, because it was more comfortable\nthat way, and finally after all the meetings his head was like that all the time.\nEven after the Cultural Revolution was finished, he would walk around the\nvillage with his head bent to the side.”\nTeacher Kong is still standing, and now he tilts his head to the left and\nwalks across the room. He laughs again and shakes his head.\n“When you’re a child, all of that seems very exciting. Of course it has\nsome influence on a child—you see something like that when you’re small,\nand it affects your thoughts. At the time we thought it was fun. During a\nmeeting they might criticize the father of a classmate, and then afterward\nwe’d make fun of the child: ‘Your father’s a Counter-Revolutionary!\nCounter-Revolutionary! Counter-Revolutionary!’ It wasn’t something we\nunderstood, but we used to say it.”\nHe imitates a child, pointing and laughing and covering his mouth as he\nsays the words, Fan Geming, Fan Geming, Fan Geming. Counter-\nRevolutionary, Counter-Revolutionary, Counter-Revolutionary. And then\nsuddenly he is serious again.\n“Nowadays people look back at that time and say it was absurd. It’s\nalmost funny, because the things people did were so huangtong, so\nridiculous. But back then, all of that was serious—it was real life. It wasn’t\nfunny. It’s impossible to understand that today.\n“And perhaps in the future it will be the same with what’s happening\nnow. Ever since Deng Xiaoping’s Reform and Opening, everything has been\nmuch better, and we know that those problems of the Cultural Revolution\nwill never happen again. But still it might look different in the future. Today\nwe look back at the Cultural Revolution and say it’s so ridiculous, but\nperhaps in the future people will look back at today, and maybe they’ll say\nthe same thing.”",
        "CHAPTER TEN",
        "Chinese New Year\nAT THE END OF THE FALL SEMESTER, our third-year students went\noff to do their practice teaching. In December, Adam and I made a trip south\nto watch a couple of our favorite students teach; they were training at middle\nschools in Wulong, a town up the Wu River near the border with Guizhou\nprovince. It was a very remote area and the schools were honored to receive\nforeign guests; for two days we gave speeches and attended banquets, and we\nplayed in an exhibition basketball game.\nAdam and I had spent so much time together that we could give a good\njoint speech without a bit of planning; we knew how to play off each other\nand everything always went smoothly. We gave the Wulong speeches half in\nEnglish and half in Chinese, and mostly we tried to get the students excited,\nwhich wasn’t difficult. After every speech hundreds of them crowded around,\nasking for autographs, and we signed until finally the cadres dragged us off to\nsome other event. We were scheduled to give speeches and attend meetings\nfor virtually every hour that we were in Wulong.\nAfter two days of that we were completely exhausted. Often my days in\nSichuan ended like that, in absolute and total exhaustion. Part of it was that I\nwas usually sick—I had chronic sinus infections from the pollution, which\nfinally made me stop running, and my health was bad enough that I was\ninfected with tuberculosis during that year. By the time I left Fuling, my\nPeace Corps medical folder would be swollen with the illnesses and injuries\nof those two years: tuberculosis, amebic dysentery, chronic sinusitis, a broken\near drum, a broken nose (from basketball), one eye with dramatically reduced\neyesight (a mystery).\nThe climate wasn’t healthy, but mostly I was run down by the pressures\nof daily life as a waiguoren. It was tiring always to be the center of attention,\nand being a foreigner meant that you were more likely to attract\ncomplications. Often there was some minor crisis or issue that demanded my",
        "attention—a Miss Ou incident, or somebody from the teahouse calling me\nevery day for a week, or something of that sort. I didn’t really mind, because\nthis was the life I had chosen; the teaching itself was rarely stressful, and I\npushed myself in the city simply because I found my Chinese life fascinating.\nTraveling usually added more stress, and there was nothing harder than\nspending time in a tiny river town like Wulong, where the pressures of Fuling\nwere intensified. It was also rewarding, because the people were thrilled to\nsee outsiders, but in the end it was impossible to maintain any control over\nyour life in a place like that. The hardest thing for me to imagine was that\nsomeday foreigners might live in towns like Wulong. It was bound to happen\nas Reform and Opening accelerated, but I couldn’t envision it, because it\nseemed to me that if a waiguoren lived there he wouldn’t last three months.\nThe intentions of the community would be nothing but the best, but they\nwould kill you with kindness—an endless parade of banquets and special\nevents. After two days in Wulong, Adam and I became sick, and it took us\nhalf a week to recover.\nWe had five weeks’ vacation for the Spring Festival, or Chinese New\nYear, starting in mid-January. Sunni went to Thailand; Noreen headed off to\nsouthern China and Vietnam. Adam decided to take the boat to Shanghai and\nthen swing south to visit Anne in Shenzhen. I planned to do some hiking\nalone in the Guizhou mountains, but the more I thought about travel in China\nthe more clearly I remembered the last train ride I had taken in Xinjiang. I\nalso thought about the exhaustion of Wulong, and my comfortable Fuling\nroutines started to look better and better.\nIn six months I would leave the city. As the vacation started, I realized\nthat my time in Fuling was limited, and I knew that there was no other place\nin China where I wanted to spend the Spring Festival. It was the biggest\nChinese holiday, a time for family reunions; Fuling was my home, and so I\nstayed.\nI WOKE UP EARLY IN THE MORNINGS and wrote for three or four\nhours. That was the English part of my day; usually it was over by ten or\neleven in the morning. To clear the language from my head, I studied Chinese\nin my apartment for another hour, reading a newspaper or listening to tapes,",
        "and after that I went to lunch at the Students’ Home. In the afternoons and\nevenings I walked around the city, and often I ate dinner with friends.\nTeacher Liao and her husband had me over a couple of times, as did Teacher\nKong, and there were several people in the city who often invited me to eat.\nIf nobody had me to dinner I ate in town or went back to the Students’ Home,\nwhich was the same as eating with friends.\nEnglish became a language strictly for writing; during that month I spoke\nnothing but Chinese. Later I would look back on that holiday as my favorite\ntime in China, because at last my Chinese life was settled, and I saw precisely\nhow I fit into the local routines. All of it had to do with Ho Wei—not a single\nEnglish department colleague invited me over or had anything to do with me\nduring the vacation. Later that spring, I would discover that this was the\nresult of explicit instructions, because from the moment Adam and I had\narrived in Fuling, the department authorities had told the English faculty not\nto associate closely with the foreign teachers. Like so many of the cadres’\npolicies, it stemmed from a vague and pointless paranoia, and perhaps the\nsaddest part was that it was extremely effective: I was much closer to the\nuneducated family at the local noodle restaurant than I was to the English-\nspeaking teachers in the college. But by isolating me, the department\nauthorities had simply pushed me to become something else, and now even if\nthey changed their minds I would never trade the life I had for English-\nspeaking friendships. During the holiday I was the only waiguoren in the\ncity, but for the first time I no longer thought of myself as being alone.\nGroups of local children often came up to my apartment, because I had\nstrings of holiday lights on my balcony and it was beautiful out there at night,\nhigh above the Wu River. Sometimes there were girls led by Ho Li, an\neleven-year-old who shared my family name and called me gege, older\nbrother. Other times I was visited by packs of wild boys who followed Wang\nXuesong, the nine-year-old across the hall. He lived with his grandparents\nand his mother, who was divorced, and the adults in his apartment had strictly\ntold him never to bother the waiguoren neighbor. But Little Wang and I\nlearned how to trick them; either he’d come with a group of other kids, or he\nwould leave his apartment and walk loudly down the steps before turning\naround, sneaking back, and knocking softly on my door. I enjoyed talking\nwith him; he would tell me about incidents on campus, life at school, and the\nfat kid in his class, who was so thoroughly despised that he had been",
        "nicknamed Chiang Kai-shek. Little Wang liked to watch my television, look\nat my photographs, and shout at people from my balcony; I let him do\nwhatever he wished. I missed my niece and nephew at home in Missouri and\nit was good to have a child around the apartment.\nTogether Little Wang and I strung nearly one hundred holiday lights\nacross my balcony, and now at night you could see them from the Yangtze. It\ntook us two hours to put all of them up, and afterward, as a reward, I let Little\nWang throw all of the burned-out bulbs down to the sidewalk six floors\nbelow, where they popped and shattered nicely. I didn’t feel particularly\nguilty about encouraging his delinquency; whenever the college workmen\ncame to replace a light in my apartment they did exactly the same thing. And\nthey seemed to enjoy it nearly as much as Little Wang, the workmen giggling\nas the glass exploded on the sidewalk.\nDowntown Fuling glowed bright across the river in the evenings. The city\nstreets were strung with red lanterns and strands of electric lights, and all of\nthe trees were decorated. The small park at South Mountain Gate had been\nturned into a riot of color—its coal-stained shrubs and trees were covered\nwith lights, dazzling in the heart of the city. Crowds gathered to look at the\npark and take photographs. As the holiday approached, it seemed that\neverybody in the city came out in the evenings, families and young couples\nand packs of children, all of them strolling aimlessly up and down the streets:\nbuying snacks, gazing at shopfronts, watching the crowds. Soldiers had\nreturned home on leave, and they marched proudly in their uniforms, keeping\nan eye out for xiaojies. Food stands sprouted along the streets and stairways\n—barbecue grills, potato vendors, tofu men, hot pot stands—and it seemed\nthat everybody ate out on the sidewalk. I did, too; I had always liked Fuling\nat night, but now everything had intensified, and I had never seen a place\nwith so much energy. Even the pathetic trees along the main road finally\nseemed alive, glowing with bright white lights. These lights had been wired\ncarelessly and sometimes they exploded and caught fire, the tree shining\nproudly with a sudden burst of flame and smoke. The pedestrians would stop\nto watch, chattering and laughing, and after the flame died—the tree hissing\nsoftly, the smoke drifting upward—they kept walking through the brilliant\ncity.",
        "ON THE NIGHT BEFORE THE CHINESE NEW YEAR, the family at\nthe Students’ Home invited me to dinner. It was the most important meal of\nthe year, a traditional time for family reunions—the equivalent of Christmas\ndinner in America. Huang Xiaoqiang closed the restaurant early, and together\nwe walked up to his apartment at the foot of Raise the Flag Mountain.\nHuang Kai was now two years old, and he had reached a stage where he\nwas frightened by waiguoren. From the beginning he had gone through\ncycles; he was a skittish child and sometimes he played with me and other\ntimes he was terrified by the sight of my face. It was a strange, mixed\nreaction—part fear and part fascination. Whenever a waiguoren appeared on\ntelevision, Huang Kai became excited and called out “Ho Wei!” His parents\nsaid that he often talked about me at home, but for some reason that winter he\nhad become terrified of seeing me in person.\nThe child started crying when I arrived at their apartment for the New\nYear’s dinner. “He’s been doing that off and on for an hour,” his mother said.\n“I told him you were coming and he started to cry; I don’t know why.”\n“I’m sorry,” I said. “I wouldn’t have come if I had known he’d be\nunhappy.”\n“No, that doesn’t matter! He’ll be fine—I’ll just take him into another\nroom for a while.”\nI sat on the couch with Huang Xiaoqiang and his father, Huang Neng, and\ntogether we watched television. That seemed to be what most Chinese people\ndid for the Spring Festival—for two days they watched as much television as\npossible. The first year I taught in Fuling, I had given my students a vacation\nassignment to write about what they did on the day of the holiday, because I\nwas interested in learning about Chinese traditions. The second year I did not\nrepeat that assignment. It was depressing to read about a holiday older than\nChristmas whose celebration seemed to have been refined to gazing at\ntelevised floor shows.\nThe Huang men sat smoking. Neat formations of PLA soldiers marched\nacross the television screen. I could hear Huang Kai crying from the back\nroom, but he was starting to calm down. His mother talked to him softly, and\noccasionally I heard my name as she spoke to the child.\n“Your soldiers in America don’t march the same way ours do in China,\ndo they?” asked Huang Xiaoqiang.",
        "“No, they don’t.”\n“When Hong Kong returned,” asked Huang Neng, “were those soldiers\nAmerican?”\nHis son corrected him: “Those were English soldiers!”\n“Well, they marched differently from us Chinese—they marched like\nthis.” Huang Neng stood up and stomped his feet. He was a small man of\nforty-nine years and he had the wiry build of a peasant. He marched across\nthe living-room floor, bringing his knees up high. “Is that how you march in\nAmerica, too?”\n“More or less.”\n“We think it looks strange—it certainly looked funny when Hong Kong\nreturned!”\n“In Western countries we don’t march like you do in China, and we think\nthe way you march looks strange. It reminds us of Xitele and Nacui—Hitler\nand the Nazis.”\n“Oh, I see—you don’t like them because of the war, right?”\n“That’s right. It’s the same as the way you Chinese see the Japanese.”\n“We Chinese don’t like the Japanese at all.”\n“I know.”\n“They killed many Chinese people in Nanjing. And they bombed your\nAmerica, too.”\n“Yes, they did. In Hawaii.”\n“In China we call them ‘small devils,’ or ‘Japanese devils.’ What do you\ncall the Japanese in America?”\n“During the war, people called them Japs.”\nHuang Neng liked the sound of the word and he said it a few times: Jia-\npahs, Jia-pahs, Jia-pahs.\n“Is it an insult?” he asked.\n“Yes. It’s like saying ‘small devil’ here in China.”\n“So you Americans also don’t like the Japanese?”\n“I think that now most people like them, or at least they don’t hate them;\nwe don’t call them Japs anymore. But during the war Americans didn’t like\nthem.”\n“That’s because they bombed your America.”\n“That’s right.”\n“But then you dropped the atomic bomb on Japan.”",
        "“Yes. We did that twice.”\n“America was the first country to have the atomic bomb.”\n“That’s true.”\n“In science your America is number one in the world. That’s why you are\na chaoji guojia—a supercountry!” Huang Neng gave me the thumbs-up and\nreturned to watching television. It had been a satisfactory conversation,\nwhich pleased him; he was the oldest man of the household and it was his\nduty to make me feel at home. On television the soldiers were finished, and\nnow there was a floor show involving colored hoops and xiaojies in tight\ncostumes. Feng Xiaoqin returned with Huang Kai. He looked at me\nuncertainly and started to play with a toy car in the far corner of the room. I\nignored him until he accidentally rolled the car close to me. I picked it up,\nwatching the child shrink in fear. I pushed the toy back to him and he turned\naway, shyly.\nWang Chaosu, Huang Neng’s wife, finished preparing dinner and all of\nus sat down. There were several pork dishes, all very spicy, and tofu and bean\nsprouts, and a fish from the downtown market. We could have eaten for three\ndays and still there would have been food left over. There was rice, too, and\nWang Chaosu spooned some into my bowl.\n“I know you like to eat your rice with your meal!” she shouted. “That’s\ndifferent from us Chinese! We like to eat it afterward!”\nWang Chaosu shouted everything at me, the way many Americans do\nwhen they meet foreigners with bad English. She was my favorite character\nin the whole family, an earthy, illiterate woman who spoke only the dialect,\nand she had a wonderful sense of humor. She loved the way that I always\nreferred to myself as “the foreign devil,” and she also thought it was funny\nthat Adam and I lied constantly about each other and the new volunteers.\nBack in the fall we had told Wang Chaosu that she could charge Sunni and\nNoreen five times the normal price for noodles, and in return for half of that\nwe wouldn’t tell them they were being cheated.\n“That’s not polite,” she said, shocked. “They just arrived and we\nshouldn’t cheat them.”\n“Who cares?” I said. “They’re just foreign devils! And they have so much\nmoney—both of them are very rich.”\n“You’re lying! I know you’re lying! Next time I’ll cheat you!” That was a\nconstant joke between us—every time we came to the restaurant she talked",
        "about how badly she was going to cheat the foreign devils.\nShe was a very good cook and the Spring Festival meal was excellent.\nPeriodically Wang Chaosu would shout out, “It’s very bad!” and I would\nreassure her that in fact it was perfect, and then she would spoon some more\ninto my bowl. “Man man chi!” she’d shout. “Eat slowly!”\nAfter dinner we returned to the couch and I played with Huang Kai. He\nwas over his fear now and we rolled a car back and forth, the child laughing.\nHis father was watching television while the grandfather sat in a chair nearby,\ncarefully cutting white and red tissue paper into strips to make fenpiao, or\ntomb decorations. The fenpiao were long narrow tubes made of white paper,\nwith a band of red in the middle and thin white strands hanging down from\nthe bottom. Tomorrow for New Year’s Day the family were going to Baitao,\ntheir home village, where they would use the fenpiao to decorate their\nancestors’ tombs.\n“We’ll go to my father’s tomb,” Huang Neng said. “I usually go there at\nleast twice a year. He died after Liberation.”\nIt always seemed to me that this word should stick in the mouths of\npeople like Huang Neng, who had been Liberated from having a father when\nthe Communists shot him. But like everybody else I knew in Fuling, he used\nthe term without a trace of irony. I asked him how old he had been when his\nfather died.\n“I was ten years old.”\n“That’s very young.”\n“At that time I didn’t understand death,” he said. “At ten years you don’t\nunderstand anything.”\nHe was smiling as he worked, cutting the paper. I rolled the car past his\ngrandson, who chased after it, laughing and shrieking.\n“Your Christmas is the same as our Spring Festival, isn’t it?” Huang\nNeng asked.\n“More or less. It’s our most important holiday.”\n“Do you go to your ancestors’ tombs at Christmas?”\n“No, we don’t have that tradition. Most Americans don’t know where\ntheir ancestors’ tombs are. It’s an immigrant country and people often move.\nYou see, my grandparents’ tombs aren’t in my hometown; they’re in\nCalifornia, which is like going from here to Shanghai. I don’t know for\ncertain where my other ancestors are—some are in Italy, others are in",
        "Germany, and a few are in Ireland and England.”\n“So many countries!”\n“Most Americans are like that.”\n“You couldn’t visit tombs in all of those places for Christmas. Imagine\nhow much money it would cost!”\n“Certainly it would cost too much. Europe is very far from my home.”\n“Well,” he said, “tomorrow we just have to go to Baitao. On the bus it’s\nonly four yuan.”\nAll of us sat together, watching television. An electric coil heater kept us\nwarm and the men used it to light their cigarettes. The floor shows were\nbetter than usual. The holiday wasn’t depressing at all now that I was sitting\nwith the family rather than reading about it in my students’ papers. We\nchatted and joked for a while, and suddenly Feng Xiaoqin became serious.\n“When you first came here,” she said, “were you sometimes disgusted by\nthe Chinese people?”\nI was taken aback by the question and I didn’t see where it had come\nfrom. I asked her what she meant.\n“Do you think that some people are very rude, because they laugh at\nyou?”\nAgain I didn’t know how to respond—it was very kind of them to have\nme in their home, and we seemed far away from anything unpleasant.\nEverybody else was intent on the television, and I thought it was better to talk\nabout something else.\n“No,” I said, “I think people are very friendly here.”\n“No, no, no,” she said, impatiently. “Like the time you and Mei Zhiyuan\nwere eating in the restaurant, and that woman was laughing at the two of\nyou.”\nMei Zhiyuan was Adam’s Chinese name. I remembered the incident,\nwhich had been minor—a month before, one of the karaoke xiaojies had been\nlaughing at us, mocking our Chinese and the way we ate. She made a few\nremarks and we told her to shut up and mind her own business. Usually we\ndid nothing about the laughter, but we considered the restaurant to be our\nturf; people had no right to mock us there, especially not karaoke xiaojies.\nI could see that Feng Xiaoqin wanted me to answer honestly. In some\nways I felt that she understood me as well as any of the people in Fuling—\nshe was always at the restaurant, where she had seen me react to many things.",
        "Like everybody, she watched me carefully, but unlike many others she also\nseemed to watch with a sense of empathy.\n“Yes,” I said. “I thought that woman was rude. She was making fun of us\nand that’s why I told her to stop laughing. But it didn’t bother me very much;\nafter that she didn’t say anything else.”\n“She has no culture,” said Feng Xiaoqin. It was a common way of saying\nthat a person was uneducated. Feng Xiaoqin shook her head and continued:\n“That’s why she treated you like that, because she has no culture. Too many\npeople in Fuling are that way.”\n“No, most people aren’t like that. And it’s much better now than it was\nwhen we first arrived.”\n“Still they should not laugh at you. It’s very rude, I think.”\nShe was looking at me steadily, and something in her black eyes made\nme glance away. I gazed at the child, babbling to himself as he played.\n“It’s not important,” I said. “It’s very kind of you to have me for dinner\ntonight—that’s much more important. Huang Kai is a very polite host.”\nShe smiled at the child, and we talked about how much he had grown and\nhow many words he could say. We didn’t mention that earlier in the evening\nhe had been afraid of me, because now the fear was gone and he was\ncomfortable with me in their apartment. And I said nothing about how in the\nchild’s fear I had seen a reflection of all the difficulties that I had ever\nencountered in Fuling, the people’s uncertainty about things new and strange.\nIt was a natural, helpless, human response—an instinct as blameless as a\nchild’s. It took time and effort to deal with that, as well as patience, and now\nI realized how much work had been done on the other side.\nThere was a great deal of generosity in their having me over for dinner.\nThey had known that the child would cry and possibly offend me, but they\nhad invited me anyway. I thought about Christmas dinner in America, and I\nwondered if I would invite a foreigner or a black to eat with my family if I\nknew that my child was afraid of such people. Probably I would—but there\nwould be a point to what I did. I would realize that this was an important\nlesson for my child, as well as an important gesture toward the guest, and this\nwould make me feel good about it. I would do it for myself as well as for the\nothers involved.\nBut tonight there wasn’t any point. Feng Xiaoqin understood me, but not\nto the degree that she knew exactly what I saw in Huang Kai and so many",
        "others in Fuling. She and her family hadn’t invited me in order to make a\npoint about xenophobia, or anything like that. They knew that I was alone on\nthe holiday, and I was their friend; nothing else mattered. They were simply\nbig-hearted people and that was the best meal I ever had in China.\nFIREWORKS AT MIDNIGHT CALLED IN THE NEW YEAR. I had\nleft the Huang home early, because I was a little tired, and I was getting ready\nfor bed when the sound started, low and steady like thunder rolling over the\nhills. The noise grew louder, echoing across the river valley, and I went out\non my back balcony to watch.\nThe Wu River looked sullen in the night. The city was also dark, but as\nmidnight approached the fireworks increased; I could see them flaring and\nflashing among the streets and stairways. The intensity of the sound doubled,\ntripled; explosions joined in from Raise the Flag Mountain, and in the\ndistance, across the Yangtze, there were flashes on White Flat Mountain. At\nthe stroke of midnight the entire city gathered itself and roared, its voice\nreverberating back and forth across the Wu, the windows of the buildings\nflickering in reflections of sparks and bursts of fire. The old year died; evil\nspirits fled; deep in the valleys heart the Wu trembled, its water colored by\nthe bright shadow of the blazing city. And finally midnight passed, and the\nfireworks faded, and we were left with a new year as empty and mysterious\nas the river that flowed silently through the valley.\nTHE NEXT MORNING I WENT INTO TOWN, where the streets were\nfull of people wearing their new clothes. Traditionally, on New Year’s Day\nyou didn’t wear anything old, and especially the children were dressed\nbrightly. Many of the little girls wore makeup; all of the boys carried guns.\nThat seemed to be another holiday tradition: plastic pellet guns were for sale\neverywhere on special streetside stands, and every male child had a rifle or a\npistol, or both. The guns were accurate and powerful, and in America you\ncould sell perhaps two of them before you were sued. In America there was\nalso a chance that a child would use the guns to shoot at birds, dogs, or cats;\nin Fuling there were very few animals but plenty of people. All around town",
        "boys chased after each other, shouting and firing their weapons.\nAnother New Year’s trend was the appearance of student-beggars. There\nwere always beggars around South Mountain Gate; usually they were\nhandicapped, and sometimes there were minority women with filthy children\nwho pulled at your sleeves. But now every time I went to town I saw two or\nthree students, dressed in their uniforms, hanging their heads in shame before\nmessage boards that featured long stories under the title “Tuition Needed.”\nThe tales were roughly the same—they couldn’t afford their high school or\ncollege fees, often because of a death in the family, and they asked for\ndonations from passersby. Usually the beggars displayed their school\nacceptance letters and student identification cards. None of them came from\nFuling; they were passing through on the Yangtze boats.\nThey made good money—piles of five- and ten-yuan notes. It said a great\ndeal about the Chinese respect for education that you could make money that\nway; I couldn’t imagine getting any response in America to such a scam. At\nleast it seemed to be a scam; over the last couple of weeks I had noticed that\ntwo of the boys were obviously working together, sharing a uniform and\nidentification. They alternated days, and I could always spot the other one\nwatching while his friend begged. My impression was that in the heart of the\nholiday they easily pulled in more than one hundred yuan a day. It was a hell\nof a lot more productive than staying home and watching television.\nI took a bus out to the Buddhist temple above the Yangtze and watched\nthe monk tell fortunes. That was Fuling’s only real temple—people told me\nthat before the Cultural Revolution there had been more than three hundred\ntemples and shrines in the area, but now there were only three, and one with\nmonks. Usually the temple had but a handful of visitors, but today on the first\nday of the New Year there were hundreds of people having their fortunes\ntold. On the street below, vendors sold balloons to children, and other\nchildren shot the balloons with pellet guns. Everywhere I went, children were\ncrying and throwing fits, and everywhere their parents were buying them\nwhatever they wanted. Like other Chinese holidays, the Spring Festival at\nmoments seemed to be a celebration of the social effects of the one-child\npolicy.\nIt was a sunny, cold day, and I walked in the hills above the river, where\na few people were lighting fireworks and decorating the old tombs. On the\npath back down to the street I passed a boy sitting on a rock. He was about",
        "seven years old and he had a rifle in his lap. As I passed I gave him a long\nlook that said: Don’t even think about it. I kept walking down the trail.\nThe pellet hit me square in the back. I had been listening for the click of\nthe barrel, but the gun was already cocked and he caught me by surprise. He\nhad been ready just in case somebody happened to walk past.\nI turned around and walked back slowly. Had he cocked the gun and shot\nme again in the chest, I might have let him keep it, out of a perverse respect\nfor his gall. But he froze, watching me come closer. I had had enough of this\nparticular New Year’s tradition and I grabbed the gun before he could react.\nHe was stunned into silence for a moment and then he started to wail. I\nturned and walked away. At the bottom of the mountain I could still hear him\ncrying, his voice rising above the fireworks that echoed in the distance.\nA few days later some of the neighborhood kids came over and I let them\nuse the rifle to shoot things in my apartment. They compared how much\nmoney each had received for the Spring Festival—that was another tradition,\nas relatives and friends gave children hongbao, “red bags” full of cash.\nLittle Wang had received 1,250 yuan, which was roughly three times the\nper capita monthly income for an urban Chinese household. All of the other\nchildren had cleared between eight hundred and one thousand yuan, except\nfor Fang Siyang, who had made less than seven hundred. She was an\nadorable girl with pigtails, and I could see that she was embarrassed to have\nreceived so little money for the holiday. Once, when I had asked what Fang\nSiyang was like, Little Wang described her social class succinctly. “Her\nfamily,” he said, “owns chickens and roosters.”\nI gave Fang Siyang and the others some American coins and postcards,\nand they left. Little Wang hung behind, playing with the gun.\n“Can I borrow this?” he finally asked.\nThe last time I had seen Little Wang, he had been particularly well\narmed, and I asked him what had happened.\n“I lost all my guns,” he said. “I don’t know where they are.”\nI looked carefully at the boy and saw that he was lying. “Did your family\ntake them away? Tell me the truth.”\nHe stood there staring at his feet, silent.\n“Did you hurt somebody else?”\n“No,” he said. But it wasn’t a very firm reply and he hung his head. He\nfingered the plastic barrel of the gun.",
        "“If I give you this gun,” I said, “will you promise not to shoot anybody?”\n“I promise.”\nI gave him the gun, knowing that I was a hopeless hypocrite. He was a\ncute kid, and when it came to children I was just as weak as Chinese parents.\nAlso, to be honest, I didn’t have much affection for the adults in his\napartment. They seemed pleasant enough, but they never invited me over,\nand whenever they saw me in the stairway they spoke very slowly and\nsimply, as if I were a simpleton or a dog. Their intentions weren’t bad, I\nknew, and in any case it didn’t justify arming their child. But one of my pet\npeeves in Fuling was when locals didn’t treat me as a person. Ho Wei was\nstupid, but he wasn’t that stupid.\nLittle Wang slipped the gun into his coat and I let him out the door. He\ngrinned at me and tiptoed down the stairs. I shut the door, quietly. A few\nseconds later I heard him come charging loudly up the steps, pounding on his\ndoor as if he had just returned from playing outside.\nIN THE FIRST WEEK OF FEBRUARY I went down river to Fengdu,\nwhere I met Teacher Kong and his wife’s family. His own parents had died\nwhen he was a child, so he always spent New Year’s with his in-laws, who\nlived in the city.\nTogether we climbed the stone steps up Double Laurel Mountain to get a\nview of the area, and after a few minutes we passed the 175-meter\nwatermark. We stopped and looked down on the city. It was a gray morning\nand all of Fengdu lay below us, stretched across the northern bank of the\nYangtze. All of it would be flooded by the new reservoir, and I asked\nTeacher Kong where his wife’s family would go after the dam was finished.\n“They’re moving across the river, to the New Immigrant City,” he said.\n“We can go over there after lunch, if you want to see what it’s like.”\n“When will they move?”\n“They don’t know yet. Maybe in two years, or longer. Many of the details\nare still uncertain.”\n“Will they have to pay anything?”\n“The government gives a lot of support, but it’s not free. They’ll have to\npay some money for the apartment, but I don’t think it’s too much. Probably",
        "two thousand yuan or more.”\n“Are they opposed to it?”\n“No,” he said. “They want to move. You’ll see their current apartment—\nit’s too small. Their new apartment will be nicer, and anyway Fengdu City is\nso dirty. It’s small and crowded. The new city will have more space, and it\nwon’t have the same problems with traffic that Fengdu has. Very few people\naround here oppose the dam.”\nThis was another benefit of the Three Gorges Project, which was a boon\nto civil engineers and urban planners, who could finally create cities with\nefficient roads and good sewage systems. And I could see why The Xus\ndidn’t mind moving; their apartment was cramped and it was located on a\nfilthy alley. But at the same time I liked Fengdu, although I liked it with a\nforeigners eye—I liked the coal-stained gray of its old-fashioned houses, and\nthe narrow cobbled streets that bustled with traffic. It was an old river town\nand there was a certain charm in its dirtiness and inconvenience.\nXu Lijia was Teacher Kong’s wife, and today was her thirtieth birthday.\nBoth of her sisters had come to their parents’ apartment to celebrate. The\nyoungest sister was in her early twenties and worked in Fengdu, while the\nmiddle sister, whose name was Xu Hua, worked for an insurance company in\nXiamen, one of the booming cities on the east coast of China. Neither of the\nyounger sisters was married.\nXu Hua carried a cell phone and contributed three bottles of French wine\nto the birthday party. We drank a bottle with the dumplings that Mrs. Guo\nhad made, toasting each other. The dumplings were very good. The wine was\nnot so good and Mt. Xu, who was fifty-three years old and worked at the\nlocal electric plant, made a face as he drank. But the wine was imported, and\nXu Hua was proud to have brought it in honor of her sister’s birthday.\nI had always liked Teacher Kong’s wife; she seemed more comfortable\nwith me than most people on campus were, probably because she was an\nindependent photographer and not a formal part of the college danwei. Many\nentrepreneurs were like that—they dealt much better with waiguoren than the\naverage person. The same was true with Xu Hua, the middle sister, who had a\ncertain east-coast sophistication. She told me that I should move to Xiamen,\nwhere there were plenty of waiguoren and the people were not as backward\nas those here in Fengdu and Fuling. There were several McDonald’s\nrestaurants in Xiamen, she said—a sign of development that struck me as",
        "impressive, since I hadn’t seen a McDonald’s in a year and a half. Xu Hua’s\nhair was cut short, and she wore tight white pants and a bright yellow jacket\nwith padded shoulders. I asked her if she had any interest in living in Sichuan\nagain.\n“Why should I come back?” she said, laughing. “Fengdu, Fuling—\nthey’re too small and remote; the jobs aren’t good. I can return for the Spring\nFestival every year. That’s enough.”\nAs we ate, Mr. Xu told me that he had a younger brother who lived in\nAmerica. This surprised me, especially when he said that his brother had a\ndoctorate from Columbia University and was now teaching at New York\nUniversity. It seemed unbelievable that a boy could come from a place like\nFengdu and have an American academic career, and I asked Mr. Xu if his\nbrother had gone to school here.\n“No, no, no,” he said. “My brother grew up in Taiwan, along with my\nthree sisters. My family was split.”\nHe said no more about this until after lunch, when he went into another\nroom and returned with a stack of letters.\n“These are from my brother in America,” he said. “He usually writes me\ntwice a year.”\nThe stack was tied with string. Mr. Xu undid it carefully, then handed me\nthe letters. All of them had been kept in their original envelopes, although\nmost of the stamps had been steamed off for Mr. Xu’s collection. Slowly I\nleafed through them. Some of the envelopes were from Taiwan and others\nhad been sent from America. Mr. Xu’s brother used the complex Chinese\nscript of Taiwan and Hong Kong, and I would have had trouble reading the\nletters even if I had felt bold enough to take them out of their envelopes. But I\nhad just met Mr. Xu, and so I merely looked at the envelopes and the bare\nplaces where the stamps had been.\nIn some ways it wasn’t necessary to read the letters, just as it wasn’t\nnecessary to know the full details of Mr. Xu’s story. That stack of envelopes\nwas poignant enough—they had been preserved with such reverence that they\nwere heavy with the intimation of a story that I knew could only be sad. And\nmostly it was clear that this brother in Taiwan had had a very different life\nthan had Mr. Xu in Fengdu.\nHe handed me a photograph of a Chinese man in his graduation gown,\nstanding before the red brick buildings of Columbia University. The man in",
        "the photograph was much younger than Mr. Xu and he was smiling. He had\nhis arm around a pretty Chinese woman. It was a sunny day and the campus\nlooked bright and clean.\n“That’s when he graduated with his doctorate,” Mr. Xu said proudly.\n“And that’s his wife—she’s Chinese, too, but she grew up in America.”\n“Have they ever come here to visit you?”\n“No,” he said. “I have never met my brother.”\nAfter he said that, the envelopes seemed even heavier. I was about to ask\nhow they had been split, but his daughter interrupted and asked how much\nmoney I thought the young man made as a teacher at New York University.\n“I don’t know,” I said. “But that’s a very good university. Probably he\nmakes at least fifty thousand dollars a year.”\n“He has a car, too,” said Mr. Xu.\n“Most people in America do,” I said.\n“How much does a car cost?”\n“It depends. Usually more than ten thousand dollars.”\n“So he must have a lot of extra money from his salary, especially since\nshe works, too. In his letters he doesn’t say very much about money.”\n“Well, I think they probably have expensive rent, you know. The living\nexpenses in America are very high, especially in New York.”\n“His wife’s father bought them a house. So probably they can save a lot\nof money, right?”\nI wasn’t exactly sure what they were getting at, but it seemed they were\njust curious to find out what the man’s life was like in America. They asked\nhow one acquired American citizenship, and they asked what it was like to\nteach in America. We talked a little about politics, and Mr. Xu asked me what\nI thought about the Taiwan issue.\nSitting there with the stack of envelopes, I couldn’t have been thrown a\nmore loaded question. I replied that I had never been to Taiwan and thus I\ndidn’t understand it.\n“What do most Americans think about it?” he pressed.\n“Most Americans also don’t understand the problem very well. I think\nmostly they want things to be peaceful.”\n“They think Taiwan is a separate country from China, don’t they?”\nI was glad to see that at least we had shifted the pronouns—whenever I\nwas on uncertain ground I tried to make it “their America” rather than “my",
        "America.” That was a small but crucial distinction, but still I found it difficult\nto respond to his question.\n“Most Americans think Taiwan is like a separate country,” I said. “It has\nits own government and economy. But Americans know the history and\nculture are the same as the mainland’s. So maybe they think it should return\nto China, but only when the people in Taiwan are ready. Most Americans\nthink this problem is much more complicated than Hong Kong.”\nMy response seemed to satisfy him. I considered asking him about his\nbrother, but I decided that it was safest to talk about it with Teacher Kong\nsome other time. Instead I asked Mr. Xu what Fengdu had been like in the\npast.\n“When Mao Zedong was the leader,” he said, “everything was bad. We\ncouldn’t talk to a waiguoren like you. In those times there wasn’t any\nfreedom and there were no rights at all. But after Deng Xiaoping started the\nReform and Opening, then everything started to improve. Things are better\nnow.”\nIt was similar to what I heard so often from people in Sichuan, although\nMr. Xu’s opinions on Mao were much more blunt. He had a poster of Deng\nXiaoping in his apartment, hanging prominently above his television.\nON THE WAY ACROSS THE YANGTZE, Xu Hua told me that she knew\nhow to drive an automobile. We were riding an old battered ferry to the\nsouthern bank, where they were constructing Fengdu’s New Immigrant City.\nThe conversation had been about some other topic when suddenly Xu Hua\ntold me that she knew how to drive.\nI had lived in Sichuan long enough to be impressed. “Is that for your\njob?”\n“No,” she said. “I studied it in my spare time.”\n“Just for fun?”\n“Yes. It’s my hobby.”\n“That must be very expensive. I know it’s expensive in Fuling.”\n“It’s much more expensive in Xiamen—it costs six thousand for the\ntraining course. But I think that someday I’ll be able to buy a car, so I wanted\nto learn how to drive now. It’s like your America—don’t most people in",
        "America have cars?”\n“Yes. Even students do—I bought one when I was in high school.”\n“You see? Here in our China the living standard is rising so quickly, and\neventually the people will be able to have their own cars just like you do in\nyour America.”\nThe ferry wallowed slowly across the heart of the Yangtze. I had a brief\nbut terrifying vision of Fuling’s traffic in twenty years. Xu Hua kept talking.\n“I want to go to your America,” she said. “New York, especially. Maybe\nsomeday I’ll go there on business for my company.”\nWe were close to the shore now and I could see an enormous sign that\nhad been erected for investors:\nThe Great River Will Be Diverted\nWhat Are You Waiting For?\nThe New City Open District Welcomes You\nThree months earlier, the river had been diverted into a man-made\nchannel beside the construction site of the future dam at Yichang. The\ndiversion was the first tangible sign of progress on the dam, and it had been\ntelevised live all across China. I had watched part of the coverage, which\nturned the newly bent river into a celebration of nationalism: construction\nworkers waved their hard hats and cheered while a military band played “Ode\nto the Motherland.” President Jiang Zemin and other politicians gave\nspeeches about the glories of modernization and the success of Socialism\nwith Chinese Characteristics. It was a foggy day and fireworks echoed\nthrough the misty hills.\nBut here in Fengdu the November celebration seemed far away. We\ndisembarked and headed up the sandy bank, walking beside mustard tuber\nfields and piles of trash. We climbed to a row of peasant homes. The homes\nwere poor and there was a heavy smell of night soil as we passed. The path\nclimbed steeply, winding between more flimsy huts. Xu Hua and the other\nwomen were dressed nicely, in high heels and bright clothes, and they moved\nslowly through the mud. At last we crested the hill, passing through a final",
        "cluster of peasant homes, and spread before us was the entire new city of\nFengdu, sprawling half-constructed in the mist.\nEver since I first arrived in China, this was what I had been expecting to\nfind someday. All of the cities I had seen were to a large extent construction\nprojects—even Yulin, the ancient city in northern Shaanxi province, had its\nshare of scaffolding and building crews. Fuling changed every month: new\nbuildings sprouted like a forest of fresh white tile and blue glass, and then a\nmonth later the buildings aged prematurely as coal stains started creeping\ndown from the roofs. Everywhere in China, people were building; the cities\nwere growing, changing entities, more alive than the countryside; and I\nalways imagined an entire nation rising at once, a China locked by\nscaffolding rather than the Great Wall.\nAnd now in Fengdu that image had finally become reality: an entire city\nwas being constructed literally before my eyes. There were streets, sidewalks,\napartment buildings, businesses—all started; none finished. You could guess\nonly vaguely where the new Fengdu was going, but mostly you could tell that\nit was going very quickly, and nothing would stop it. Indeed, if it was stopped\nat this moment, it would be completely worthless. Here in the forgotten heart\nof China I had found the perfect metaphor of the entire country’s\ndevelopment.\nToday there was little work being done and the construction site was\nquiet. But it wasn’t empty—crowds of people had come across the river from\nFengdu to see their new city. Most of them were well-dressed, the way\nChinese looked when they went to spend a day at the park. The men wore\nneat suits and the high-heeled women stumbled over the rough dirt streets,\ngiggling and splashing mud onto their stockings. They stared at the\nscaffolding and the enormous piles of dirt that bordered the intersections. The\nhalf-built streets bristled with propaganda signs:\nThe Development Relies on the Immigrants, the Immigrants Rely on the\nDevelopment!\nThe People Build the Peoples City, If It Is Built Well, the City Will Serve",
        "the People!\nWe stopped on what would someday be the main street—Pingdu Road—\nand Xu Hua used her cell phone to call a friend in Xiamen and wish her a\nhappy birthday. Among the new buildings there were still a half-dozen\npeasant homes, small and resolute in the shadow of their towering neighbors.\nChickens wandered down side alleys. Potato fields were squeezed between\nthe construction sites. A few graves still remained, their white tomb\ndecorations hanging limp in the mist, paying homage to the ancestors who lay\nin the earth below this rising city.\nThe majority of the peasant homes had been removed and now the people\nlived in a couple of apartment buildings that had been nearly finished. The\nex-peasants sat at tables in the middle of the construction site, drinking tea\nand playing mah-jongg. I asked Teacher Kong what the peasants would do\nnow, and he said that most of them helped with construction work and waited\nfor the factory jobs that would be given to them once the city was built. In the\nmeantime, like the ex-peasants whom I had seen in the resettlement area\nbehind Fuling Teachers College, they seemed perfectly content to drink tea\nand play mah-jongg while the city rose around them.\nWe took photographs in front of an enormous sign that showed the street\nplan for the new city. The two younger women liked my baseball cap, and\nthey took turns wearing it for the pictures. Xu Lijia spent a roll of film there,\nmostly for photos of her sisters in classic xiaojie poses: shoulders pushed\nback, head angled seductively, a soft smile and flirty eyes. For all of the\npictures they wore my dirty old Princeton cap. In the background was the\nsign and the scaffolding and the piles of dirt. We hiked back down to the\nferry, through the potato fields and the thick river mist, and Teacher Kong\nasked, “So, what do you think of the New Immigrant City?”\nIn truth I had never before seen anything even remotely like it: an entire\nnew city, dozens of dislocated peasants playing mah-jongg, future flood\nrefugees strolling through the construction site as if it were a park. The\nquestion was unanswerable, and so I answered in the same way that I did to\nall questions of that sort.\n“I think it’s very good,” I said.",
        "BACK IN FENGDU we caught a cab on the docks. I was heading to the bus\nstation, and we would drop off the women along the way.\nA Yangtze boat had just docked and there was a long line of cabs waiting\nto go to town. It had started to rain softly, which made the road slippery with\nmud. Cabs were honking madly. People scurried along the street, holding\nnewspapers over their heads.\nThe road climbed steeply to the city, and the last stretch was too slick for\nthe cabs. Four of them tried to accelerate up the rise, but their tires spun\nuselessly. One by one the cars drifted backward. Our driver gunned his\nengine and made it halfway up the hill before sliding back. He tried again.\nAfter our third attempt, the women got out of the cab and walked up the\nhill into town. This time our driver started from farther back, working up a\ngreat deal of speed, but still his tires spun near the top and we didn’t quite\nmake it. The hill was very steep and smooth, and I found myself looking at\nthe situation analytically and thinking of all the simple ways in which it could\nbe improved. This was a very bad habit that nearly all foreigners fell into\nwhen they lived in China, and even after a year and a half I couldn’t quite\nshake it.\nI thought about how it wouldn’t be difficult to regrade the hill, making it\nless steep, or they could wind the road across the slope of the bank. Probably\nthe simplest solution would be to cut lateral grooves into the pavement, so\ntires would have something to grip when it rained. I considered all of these\noptions and was engaged in choosing the best solution when suddenly I\nthought: Screw it. This entire city will be underwater in a few years. Who\ngives a damn? They can build a new road in the new city across the new\nriver.\nOn the fifth try we finally made it. I could smell the tires as the driver\nraced through town. At the station I shook Teacher Kong’s hand, thanking\nhim for his hospitality, and then I caught a bus back to Fuling. The road ran\nlow alongside the river. It rained harder. All of the villages I passed through\nwere waiting patiently for the flood.\nA COUPLE OF WEEKS LATER I had class with Teacher Kong and asked",
        "about his father-in-law, Mr. Xu. He explained that Mr. Xu’s father had\ngraduated from university in Wuhan, after which the Kuomintang had sent\nhim to do radio work in Chengdu. That was in the 1940s, and eventually he\nwas transferred to Taipei, the capital of Taiwan. His wife and two young\nchildren stayed behind with relatives in Fengdu. The move wasn’t permanent,\nand always Mr. Xu’s father thought he would return to his family in Sichuan.\nBut after 1949, when the Kuomintang fled to Taiwan, the family was\ndivided for good. They couldn’t even exchange letters, and Mr. Xu, who was\na young child in Fengdu, started a long lifetime of helpless bad luck.\n“After Liberation their life was very hard,” Teacher Kong explained. “His\nmother starved to death in the early years, because things were so bad in the\ncountryside. The children barely survived, and once they started school they\nhad many problems with persecution, because their father was in Taiwan.\nDuring the Cultural Revolution they were labeled Pantu, ‘Traitors,’ and\nTewu, ‘Special Agents’—spies, really. At that time there were the Nine Black\nCategories—do you know about those? There were Landlords, Rich Peasants,\nCounter-Revolutionaries, Bad Elements, Rightists, Traitors, Special Agents,\nCapitalist Roaders, and the Old Stinking Ninth, who were intellectuals. You\nand I would be the Old Stinking Ninth—sometimes even now teachers like us\nwill call each other that, as a joke.\n“The two children didn’t suffer much violence, but they were persecuted.\nMostly it meant they didn’t have opportunities. If they wanted to study past\nmiddle school, or get a good job in a factory, they had no chance. And during\nthe political meetings everybody criticized them, even though they had hardly\nknown their father.\n“After Reform and Opening, Mr. Xu started sending letters to Taiwan to\nsee if his father was still alive. Sometime after 1980, he found him—until\nthen he didn’t even know if his father was dead or not. They started\ncorresponding, and in 1988 his father returned to the mainland to visit for the\nfirst time. He had a good job in Taipei with the telegraph company—he was\nbasically the same rank as a high cadre is here on the mainland. He had\nremarried after Taiwan was split, and he had other children, including the son\nwho is now in America.\n“After China-Taiwan relations started to improve, the government began\nto give jobs to people like my wife’s father, because they had been\npersecuted. This was a way to improve relations. So in 1988, Mr. Xu was",
        "given a job in the electric plant. But of course by that time he had already had\na very hard life. Even today he doesn’t like to talk about the Cultural\nRevolution.”\nI thought of the old man in Fengdu with his stack of envelopes. So often\nmy experiences in Sichuan were like that—I brushed against people just long\nenough to gain the slightest sense of the dizzying past that had made them\nwhat they were today. It was impossible to grasp all of the varied forces that\nhad affected Mr. Xu’s life and would continue to affect him in the future—\nthe war, the Taiwan split, the Cultural Revolution; the dammed river and the\nnew city; his pretty daughter in Xiamen with her cell phone and driving\nlessons. How could one person experience all of that, helpless from start to\nfinish, and remain sane?\nBut I remembered the poster of Deng Xiaoping above his television, and I\nremembered the way he had grimaced while drinking the bad French wine\nthat his daughter had brought from Xiamen. It was clear that he didn’t like\nthe taste of the wine, but he knew that it was an expensive and prestigious\npart of the celebration, and thus he drank it dutifully until his glass was\nempty. Afterward his daughter refilled the glass. He drank that, too.\nNEAR THE END OF VACATION I was involved in a public argument on\nGaosuntang, the main uptown intersection in Fuling. It happened out of the\nblue, and it was by far the most serious dispute I had ever been involved in.\nOften in the evenings I ate there during the holiday, because I had gotten\nto know a few of the regulars who worked the sidewalk. Zhang Longhua was\nmy main friend; during the day he sold cigarettes and ran a pay phone, and at\nnight he peddled kebabs from a barbecue stand. He was a friendly, even-\ntempered man, and I had noticed that the regulars tended to defer to him.\nOccasionally there were disputes out there at night—sometimes between\ncustomers and salesmen, but more commonly between the vendors, who had\nstaked out certain spheres of influence on the busy sidewalk. At night the\nwalk was crowded and a barbecue man like Mr. Zhang could clear fifty yuan\non a good night. Last year he had sold kebabs down in Shenzhen, but he\nreturned to Fuling because the overhead was lower.\nOnce I saw two barbecue xiaojies engage in a vicious turf fight, the kind"

      "text": "“Yes,” the priest said. “And she was very good for our church. She was\nhere every Sunday.”\n“What was her job?”\n“She was retired, of course. But before that she worked at the Hailing\nfactory.”\nThere was a small number of parishioners who went to Mass every week,\nand I asked some more questions to see if I could remember the woman.\nFather Li answered patiently, and then finally he pointed behind me and said,\n“She’s right there.”\nI turned around and saw the woman laid out ten feet behind me, on a\ntable at the back of the room. The place was dimly lit and I hadn’t noticed her\nwhen we came in. A white sheet was pulled up to her chin. She was a small\nwoman with gray hair and her mouth was pinched shut. I remembered seeing\nher in church. I was in the middle of eating a cookie and now I put it down on\nthe tray.\n“Oh,” I said. “There she is.”\n“Yes,” said Father Li. “That’s her.”\n“Well,” I said. “I think I’ll go outside now.”\nIt was sunny in the courtyard and the parishioners were writing\nmemorials on long strips of white paper. A number of big funeral wreaths,\nmade of white tissue and bamboo, were set against the wall of the church. In\nthe sunshine I recovered quickly from the shock of seeing the body on the\ntable, and I watched the people as they went about the business of mourning.\nAll of the old ladies had been waiting patiently for me to finish my coffee,\nand now they entered the room to pay their respects to the body.\nThe woman’s son was there, a man in his fifties, and he was thrilled that a\nwaiguoren had come to his mother’s funeral. I told him that his mother had\nalways been very kind to me, which made him even happier. It was a\ntradition for the family to give small gifts at a funeral, and the son gave me\nsome fruit and a box of Magnificent Sound cigarettes. I thanked him and\naccepted the cigarettes. It was hard to imagine a more appropriate funeral\ngift.\nLater I went to the teahouse, where Zhang Xiaolong, the Luckiest Man in\nFuling, grinned and waved. He was with some of the other old men and I\ntook an empty table nearby. The waitress came over, smiling, and asked me\nwhat I wanted.\n\n“The yangguizi wants a cup of tea,” I said. Calling myself yangguizi,\n“foreign devil,” was one of the easiest and most disarming jokes in Fuling. I\nhad started using that word to describe myself during the summer, and people\noften didn’t know how to react; sometimes they were embarrassed and tried\nto persuade me to call myself something different. But I always responded by\nproudly saying something like “We foreign devils have a long history” or\n“We foreign devils have a great culture.”\nAt the teahouse it was an old joke between me and the xiaojie, the young\nwoman who worked there. She covered her mouth and laughed, and then she\npoured me a cup of tea. I had bought a newspaper on the street and now I\nread it while the tea cooled.\nIt was a typical day at the teahouse and a few people came up and talked\nwith me. At the end of the morning, a young woman whom I had never met\ncame and sat at my table. We talked for perhaps ten minutes. It was slightly\nunusual for a woman to approach me, but not so unusual that I thought\nanything of it. Her name was Li Jiali, and she asked for my phone number.\nThis was also common—I always gave my number to people in Fuling. The\nonly problem was that some of them had a tendency to call between the hours\nof five and seven o’clock in the morning, so I often took my phone off the\nhook when I was sleeping. I gave my number to Li Jiali and thought no more\nabout it.\nA week later I returned to the teahouse, and once again she sat at my\ntable. She was dressed in a very short skirt and tights and she wore a great\ndeal of makeup. She was not pretty, but she had successfully adopted a\nnumber of the habits that you saw in a certain type of xiaojie, who smiled too\nmuch and talked in a cutesy way, drawing out her words at the end of\nsentences. The woman who worked at the teahouse was not like this, and I\nsaw her shaking her head as Li Jiali sat posing at my table. The old men were\nstaring; even their birds seemed stunned into silence. I could see that\nsomething was happening that I didn’t understand, and so I excused myself,\npaid for the tea, and left.\nLi Jiali followed me out of the teahouse. “Where are you going?” she\nasked.\n“I have to go now,” I said. “I’m going to eat and then I’m going home.”\nWe passed a noodle restaurant where I often ate. Suddenly I had a great\nfear of this woman following me home and being seen with me on campus.\n\n“I’m leaving now,” I said. “I must eat at this restaurant. Goodbye.”\n“Oh, I’ll eat with you,” said Li Jiali.\nThe owner of the restaurant cleared a table and I found myself sitting\nthere with the woman. That was how everything always went in Fuling—\nthings happened to me. Usually I liked the passive unpredictability but today\nI was suspicious of her intentions, and yet I had no idea what to do. She sat\nthere chattering about something and I asked her where she worked.\n“That’s not important,” she said, and suddenly it became very important.\n“Do you work here in Fuling?”\n“It’s not a good job,” she said, shrugging. “But my uncle is getting me a\nbetter job in Chongqing. He owns a big restaurant—he’s very rich! He’s\ngiving me a job there as a xiaojie. The xiaojie at my uncle’s restaurant wear\nfine clothes—I’ll have to wear a qipao like this”—she showed me how it\nwould look: no shoulders, tight around the neck, slit high up her thigh.\n“Oh,” I said.\n“But it’s very expensive,” she said. “I’ll have to buy the qipao myself.”\n“That’s too bad,” I said.\n“Do you like to sing karaoke?”\n“No,” I said. “I do not like to sing karaoke. Most Americans do not like\nto sing.”\n“We should go to a karaoke bar sometime. I’ll teach you how to sing.”\n“Sorry, but I’m not interested in karaoke.”\n“That’s okay,” she said, smiling. “I’m very interested in your America.”\n“What about my America interests you?”\n“Everything. I would like to go there.”\nI did not like the way this conversation was going. “It’s very difficult to\ndo that,” I said.\n“I would like to live in your America,” she said. “People there have more\nmoney than here.”\n“There are many poor people in my America.”\n“Not as many as there are here in Fuling.”\nShe had a point and I tried a different tack. I talked about how difficult\nvisas were to obtain, and then our noodles arrived. I ate quickly and tried to\nthink of what to do next.\n“Ho Wei,” she said. “You are very ke’aide”—adorable. She said it in the\nbest xiaojie manner and I was certain that the others in the restaurant were\n\nlistening now.\n“Your eyes are very pretty,” she said. “I think you waiguoren have\nprettier eyes than us Chinese.”\n“It’s not true,” I said dumbly. “Chinese are much prettier than waiguoren.\nWaiguoren are very hard to look at.” She took this as a compliment, smiling\nand trying to blush. I thought: Ho Wei, you are a jackass.\n“I like to hear you speak our Chinese language, Ho Wei,” she said. “It\nsounds very funny!”\nI remembered how guys in college used to hit on the local au pair girls\nfrom Sweden with their accents and cluelessness. It was not a pleasant\ncomparison, and I tried not to think about it.\nWe were leaving the restaurant now and the owner grinned knowingly as\nI paid. On the street Li Jiali took my arm and I stood there in passive\ndisbelief. A Fuling woman was touching me and we were right near the\nintersection of South Mountain Gate; everybody was honking at us, or so it\nseemed.\n“I have to go now,” I stammered. “You can’t come with me. I am very\nbusy today.”\n“Next week is my birthday,” Li Jiali said.\n“That’s nice,” I said.\n“I’ll see you next week,” she said.\nA cab swung by, horn blaring, and I smelled the hot breath of its exhaust.\nThe sun was warm and now I was sweating. “Goodbye,” I said, and at last\nshe let me go.\nTWO DAYS LATER, Li Jiali called and Ho Wei answered the phone. She\nasked if he would be at the teahouse on Sunday and he replied that he would.\nHe was there every Sunday and there was no reason to lie about that.\nAfter the phone call, I began to think once more about the possible\ncomplications of this particular aspect of my Chinese life, as well as the many\nways in which Ho Wei was not capable of dealing with them. The simplest\nsolution was to avoid going to the teahouse, but she knew I worked at the\ncollege and I did not want her to track me down there.\nI knew that Li Jiali was trouble—she was far too forward for a Chinese\n\nwoman, and either she wanted money or she was crazy. Adam and I had both\nhad experiences with this in the first year. A freshman girl student had spent a\ncouple of weeks lurking outside of Adam’s apartment, and there was a\nmiddle-aged woman named Miss Ou who had pursued me more or less\nthroughout my time in Fuling. Both of these women were clearly unbalanced,\nand undoubtedly they turned to us because we were outside the loop, just like\nthem. That was at once the most interesting and most disturbing aspect of\nliving in Fuling—as a waiguoren you tended to attract a certain fringe\nelement. It was possible to have a Chinese life, but that didn’t mean it was a\nnormal Chinese life.\nLast year those complications had at least been in English, which gave us\na certain degree of control over the interactions. But now it was strictly in\nChinese—I met the people on their terms. And I knew that Li Jiali’s terms\nwould be difficult to deal with; somehow I would have to convince her that\nshe would not get whatever it was that she wanted. It was all Ho Wei’s show\nand I didn’t have much confidence in his ability to handle the problem.\nThe next Sunday, I delayed my trip to the teahouse as long as possible. I\nspent a long time chatting with Father Li, and then I wandered down to the\nblacksmith’s shop and watched them make chisels. It was nearly noon by the\ntime I made it to the teahouse.\nThe xiaojie brought me tea; I was too nervous to make any foreign-devil\njokes. She smiled and said that Li Jiali had been looking for me. I asked her if\nshe knew the woman.\n“I know her, but she’s not my friend.”\n“Where does she work?”\n“She works across the street, at the meifating.” It meant “beauty parlor,”\nbut it also meant something else, and the xiaojie, like everybody in Fuling,\nspoke the word with distinct scorn. Most of the city’s prostitutes worked in\nbeauty parlors and now I knew for certain what Li Jiali did for a living.\nI sat there and waited for her. One of the teahouse regulars came over and\ntalked with me. Usually he was annoying, because he was a fanatical disciple\nof Falun Gong, which was a mixture of Buddhism, Taoism, and qigong-style\ndeep-breathing exercises. At first I had been interested in hearing him talk\nabout Falun Gong, simply because I had never heard of it and the local\nfollowers seemed to believe with religious intensity, which was a rare passion\nin Fuling. But soon the man came to see me as a potential convert, and he\n\noften telephoned and gave me long lectures on the benefits of Falun Gong.\nHe especially liked to call at five o’clock in the morning, because it showed\nhow little sleep he needed now that Falun Gong had entered his life.\nIt was another mess of Ho Wei’s. I had no interest in any sort of qigong\n—I was a runner and I disliked the idea of an exercise regimen that involved\nmoving as slowly as possible. Of course, I might have been more interested\nin talking with the man if I had known that in 1999 the Communist Party\nwould ban Falun Gong as a cult, persecuting its followers. But in Fuling I had\nno idea that the practice would someday become such a political issue, and I\nnever would have imagined that the government would consider it to be a\nthreat. As far as I was concerned, the main problem with Falun Gong was\nthat it woke me up at five o’clock in the morning.\nBut today I was happy for any distraction and I listened to the man’s\nlecture. A major sticking point between us was alcohol—his personal\ninterpretation of Falun Gong stressed no smoking or drinking, and in a\nmoment of desperation I had latched onto this as a way of discouraging him,\nexplaining that there was no way I could ever give up beer. Like so many of\nHo Wei’s solutions, this was a serious miscalculation. It resulted in the man’s\nmaking a full-fledged assault on the dangers of alcohol, week after week, in\nmind-numbing detail. His lectures began with the way alcohol settles in your\ncells, whereas Falun Gong seeks to bring everything into balance at the\ncellular level. There was more to this explanation, but I always lost the thread\nand sat there nodding as if I understood.\nLi Jiali arrived while the man was lecturing. She smiled and sat down at\nour table. I didn’t acknowledge her, and the man continued lecturing about\nalcohol and Falun Gong. All of the old bird men were watching.\nShe was dressed brightly again and she put on her makeup at our table.\nShe dabbed rouge onto her cheeks, looking into a tiny mirror, and then she\nput on eyeshadow. In Fuling, few women wore much makeup, and even\nfewer painted their faces in public, which was a sign of loose morals. There\nwere many signs like that—the clearest was for a xiaojie to smoke a cigarette\nin public, because when a Fuling woman did that you could be almost certain\nthat she was a prostitute. Li Jiali was not smoking but the show of painting\nher face was bad enough.\nShe tried several times to get my attention until at last I looked over.\n“Ho Wei,” she said, “your American name is Pete, isn’t it?”\n\n“Yes.” She had asked me this the first time we met, and now I regretted\ntelling her.\n“Pete,” she said. She pronounced it “Bee-do” and I didn’t like hearing her\nsay it; I saw no reason to bring that name into Ho Wei’s mess. “Bee-do,” she\nsaid again, “did you bring me a gift?”\n“No.”\n“I told you it was my birthday!” Again this was the flirty xiaojie voice\nand I felt my anger rise.\n“In America we don’t have that tradition,” I said.\n“You don’t give presents on birthdays?”\n“We don’t ask people to give us presents.”\nIt was one of the sharpest things Ho Wei had ever said, but it didn’t faze\nher. I could bring her a present next week, she said. She asked if I would take\nher to lunch today, and I decided that I had had enough.\n“I already have a girlfriend,” I lied. “At the college I have a waiguoren\ngirlfriend—the tall one with red hair.” I figured that Noreen was the best\nchoice, because she was tall and her height sometimes intimidated the\nChinese. The Falun Gong man was listening carefully now.\n“That’s okay,” Li Jiali said. “It doesn’t matter if you have a girlfriend.”\n“I have to go now,” I said. “I don’t want to eat lunch.”\n“I’ll go with you,” the man said.\nWe stood up and Li Jiali said something to him. They were talking\nquickly in the dialect, and I walked out of the teahouse. On the street they\ncaught up with me. The Falun Gong man was on my left, and Li Jiali started\ntugging at my right arm. “Bee-do,” she said, “where are you going?”\n“Please leave me alone,” I said.\nI pulled away, slipping into the crowd, and the Falun Gong man\nwhispered in my ear, “What’s your guanxi with her?”\n“There’s no guanxi. I don’t know who she is. She bothers me.”\n“You don’t have any interest in her?”\n“No, not at all.”\nLi Jiali had caught us again, and she came between me and the man. He\nsaid something to her and she responded sharply, and now he turned and\nfaced her. He shouted at the woman and she shouted back, calling him a\ngui’erzi, a Sichuanese obscenity meaning “son of a turtle.” All of the xiaojie\ncuteness was gone, and it was as if a mask had been stripped away; she spat\n\nat him and shouted obscenely like a whore. People stopped to watch. The\nman stood his ground, shouting back, and in a minute it was over. Li Jiali\ntossed her head and stormed down the street.\nThe crowd dispersed and I walked to the bus stop with the Falun Gong\nman. I looked back over my shoulder and I could feel my heart beating. For\nonce I was glad that I had tolerated so many of the man’s phone calls and\nlectures about alcohol. I promised myself that I would always be polite with\nhim, and that at least once I would try his exercises.\n“She was asking me to leave you alone with her,” he said.\n“Is she a prostitute?”\n“Perhaps,” he said, but it was the Chinese perhaps that meant: Certainly.\nWe came to the bus and I thanked him.\n“You need to be more careful,” he said. “Often people like that will want\nyou for your money, or because you’re a waiguoren. You shouldn’t give your\nphone number to everybody. And remember that I don’t want your money—I\nonly want to teach you Falun Gong. I’m different from her.”\nI nodded and got on the bus. For the next three weeks I shifted my\nroutines to avoid the teahouse. Li Jiali moved to Chongqing, and later that\nfall she sent me a series of love letters, which I ignored. I never saw her\nagain. I never tried Falun Gong. In the early mornings I kept my phone off\nthe hook. I realized that complications were an inevitable result of my\nChinese life, but I also realized that even at his worst Ho Wei could find a\nway to bumble out of problems. I had allowed him this much freedom, and in\nthe end it was like an adult watching a child grow up—there was only so\nmuch control that I could take over that part of my life, and its\nunpredictability, although risky, was much of its charm. All I could do was\nlet Ho Wei go his own way and hope for the best.\n\nTHE RESTAURANT OWNER\nHUANG XIAOQIANG WANTS A VIDEODISC PLAYER. He wants a\ncellular phone. He wants a car so he can work as a cab driver. He wants to\ninvest more money in the stock market, and he wants to increase his earnings\nso all of the people he lives with, his parents and wife and two-year-old son,\ncan have a better apartment and more security. He wants all of these things,\nbut all he has right now is a small noodle restaurant called the Students’\nHome, and so he does the best he can with that.\nWhat the noodle restaurant has is good location. It is more or less at the\ncenter of the East River district, across the street from the college gate, where\nwomen sell fruit and snacks from makeshift stands. There are almost always\nstudents sitting at the restaurant’s six tables, and things are especially busy on\nSunday evenings, when the students finish their political meetings and head\nout for dinner. Above the Students’ Home there is a karaoke bar of suspicious\npurpose, and in the evening the karaoke xiaojies come downstairs for meals.\nThe xiaojies wear beepers and too much makeup, and they talk too loudly,\neating noodles alongside the fresh-faced students who have just finished their\ndiscussions of Socialism with Chinese Characteristics.\nHuang Xiaoqiang knows all of the locals—the bus drivers and the fruit\nvendors, the ceramics factory workers and the shop owners, the students and\nthe karaoke xiaojies. He knows their routines, the bus schedules and the\nfactory work shifts and the college political meetings, and his own routine is\nintertwined with the rest of the East River lives. The restaurant’s schedule is\nsimple: it opens at six o’clock in the morning and closes at eleven at night.\n“Hen xinku,” Huang often says. “Very difficult.” But he is only half in\nearnest, because he has so much help: his parents and his wife, a pretty\ntwenty-five-year-old woman named Feng Xiaoqin. Often his older sister, who\nworks down the street at the ceramics factory, stops by to help. And usually\nthere are other workers, relatives and friends from the Huangs’ home village\n\nof Baitao, south of Fuling. In fact, of all the workers Huang Xiaoqiang is\nprobably the least diligent. His wife and mother are the backbone of the\nrestaurant, because Huang spends much of his time smoking Magnificent\nSound cigarettes and cultivating guanxi with the local men.\nHe is twenty-six years old, and five years ago he took the long train ride\nfrom Chengdu to the western desert province of Xinjiang in order to look for\nwork. “Too cold,” he says. “There were jobs, and the jobs were fine, but the\nweather was no good. Too cold in the winter, too hot in the summer.” The\nfollowing year he went south to Guangzhou, where the weather was better\nbut the jobs not to his taste.\nThis is a common pattern for young people in Sichuan, which in the past\nwas the most populous province in China, home to more than 120 million\npeople. In March of 1997, the province was split in two, with Fuling and the\nother river towns falling under the jurisdiction of the newly created\nChongqing Municipality. This change was made to improve administration of\nthe overcrowded region, as well as help prepare for the Three Gorges Project,\nbut the split is still too recent to have affected the common notion of what\ncomposes Sichuan. Fuling residents still refer to themselves as Sichuanese,\nand there is still no shortage of men and women from this part of the world.\nOne of every fifty people on earth comes from Sichuan.\nAnd often they go somewhere else. The region’s mountains and river\nvalleys have long been home to the sort of hardships that send young people\naway, and in every Chinese city it is possible to find Sichuanese migrants.\nThey can be found with particular frequency working in restaurants, or\nlaboring on construction sites, or staffing beauty parlors. The urban Chinese\noften do not like the Sichuanese migrants, describing them as hardworking\nbut uncultured, clever but untrustworthy. Some people say the Sichuanese\nwomen are tramps; the men are jiaohua, sly. These are, of course, familiar\nstereotypes to anybody who is an industrious and determined migrant in any\npart of the world, and they deter the Sichuanese exactly as much as they deter\nothers who have left difficult conditions—in short, not at all. This is\nsomething else that the Sichuanese are famous for, their ability to chiku, to\neat bitter. They don’t care what people think, and they don’t care what work\nthey find, as long as it is work. And in hordes they continue to leave the\nregion.\nBut Huang Xiaoqiang came home. He married, bought his restaurant,\n\nsettled into the routine. In the mornings, he and the other workers make\nchaoshou, the local version of wonton, and at midday they hustle to handle\nthe lunch rush, and late at night, when the next day’s rice noodles arrive, they\ntie the soft strands into five-ounce bundles so they will be ready for\ntomorrow. Day after day it is exactly the same.\nRARELY DOES Huang Xiaoqiang talk about politics in the restaurant. One\nevening, when asked about the government, he shrugs his shoulders and says\nthat with regard to China’s policies he has no guanxi. “Jiang Zemin is very\nbig,” he says. “And I am very small.”\nHe notices a picture of Mao Zedong on the cover of an English book,\nEdgar Snow’s Red Star over China, and he studies the title. “Kanbudong,” he\nsays, laughing. “I don’t understand.” But he comprehends the picture; he has\na poster of Mao on the wall of his home. “Mao Zedong was our leader,” he\nsays. “During the Revolution, he was a great man, but afterward…” He\nshakes his head. And then comes one of those stories that are so common in\nChina, the kind of story that makes the country seem hopelessly foreign to\nany outsider.\nIt’s a short story, really. Huang’s grandfather was a peasant landlord, and\nin 1958, during the struggle of Communist land reform, he was executed.\nHuang demonstrates how they shot him—in the back of the neck—and then\nhe laughs. But it is the unsettling Chinese laugh that has nothing to do with\nhumor. It simply takes the place of words that aren’t there.\nBut in the mad rush that is recent Chinese history, 1958 was a very long\ntime ago, which is another reason why such stories are so short. They are told\nand then they are gone.\n“Today everything’s better,” Huang Xiaoqiang says quickly. “In the past\nyou couldn’t speak freely. Everything you said, you always had to worry\nabout whether it was Capitalist or Counter-Revolutionary. But it’s not like\nthat now. Since Deng Xiaoping was the leader, everything has been fine. The\nliving standard is much higher and we can have private business. We’re the\nsame as landlords, really.”\nThis causes a brief debate in the restaurant, where the customers begin\narguing with Huang. The word “landlord” is still politically charged, and\n\nperhaps he used it too lightly. But the debate doesn’t last long; the others\nrealize that he is referring to opportunity rather than exploitation, and in any\ncase none of them cares much for politics. Most, like Huang, are independent\nworkers: bus drivers, vendors, shop owners. They don’t belong to a danwei,\nwhich means that profits are defined solely by intelligence, effort, and luck.\nThe absence of a danwei also means that they enjoy significant freedom.\nHuang Xiaoqiang attends no political meetings. Nobody tells him how many\nhours to work or what to serve in his restaurant. The income tax he pays is\nminimal and actually has little guanxi to what he makes. A government\nofficial comes every year to estimate the monthly earnings of the restaurant,\nand Huang pays ten percent of that. Currently the estimate is one thousand\nyuan a month, and accordingly his monthly tax is one hundred. In fact, the\nrestaurant generally clears between two and three thousand yuan each month,\nbut regardless, the tax is the same. One of the Characteristics of Chinese\nSocialism is that small enterprises can engage in virtually unrestricted\ncapitalism, which works to the advantage of the Huang family.\nBut another Characteristic is that the government provides no insurance\nto people without a danwei, and so the restaurant follows a long schedule of\nseventeen-hour days while Huang Xiaoqiang looks for new ways to make\nmoney. In the meantime, though, he is content to run his restaurant, and with\nregard to China’s politics he has neither deep complaints nor broad vision.\nAnd his non-danwei customers are more or less the same. They just want to\nwork and carve out a good living, and if, like him, they can work with their\nfamilies, their happiness is doubled.\nTHE WORLD of the Students’ Home is small. It doesn’t extend much\nbeyond the East River district, and it is centered on Huang’s family. His two-\nyear-old son, Huang Kai, took his first steps in the restaurant. He read his\nfirst simple characters from the menu board, and his first favorite food was\nchaoshou. During lulls in the day, the boy sits on his grandparents’ laps and\nlooks at children’s books. His grandmother, Wang Chaosu, is illiterate, but\nshe knows the books by heart and she recites them to Huang Kai.\nThey have no desire to go elsewhere. “We’re here for yibeizi,” Huang\nXiaoqiang says. “A lifetime.” Sometimes they express interest in the outside\n\nworld—Huang’s father, Huang Neng, often asks how much a plane ticket to\nAmerica costs, and how long it takes. “Fifteen hours!” he says once, amazed.\n“Do they have bathrooms on the plane?”\n“Of course they do,” laughs his daughter-in-law, Feng Xiaoqin. Another\ncustomer at the restaurant, a local shop owner, speaks up. “There are big\nbuses between Chongqing and Chengdu that have bathrooms,” he says\nknowingly. “Telephones, too. On the high-speed expressway they take just\nfour hours.”\nBut this is only talk; they have no wish to travel. “It’s too expensive,”\nsays Feng Xiaoqin. And if she had the money? “If I had ten thousand yuan,\nthen I’d want forty thousand,” she laughs. “That’s the way I am, just like\neverybody else—it’s never enough. You Americans like traveling so much.\nIt’s too much trouble: you have to carry your bag here, carry your bag there. I\nwouldn’t want to go to America and have to learn English. It’s too much\nhassle.”\nAny changes are made within the world of the restaurant. In the fall of\n1997, the college, which owns the building, suddenly raises the monthly rent\nfrom three hundred yuan to seven hundred, and the Huang family cuts down\non spending. They buy a public telephone to increase profits. But the first\nmonth they lose three hundred yuan, because they don’t understand the long-\ndistance rates. The next month they adjust and turn a profit. Huang Xiaoqiang\nspends four weeks and three thousand yuan on a training course so he can get\nhis driver’s license. This document is his proudest possession; obtaining the\nprivilege to drive is difficult and expensive in China. He begins to look for\nwork. “I have no guanxi,” he says. “But that’s not the most important thing.\nMostly they look at your ability, and you have to be lucky.”\nAnd so he has no job, but he has his license, which means opportunity.\nAnd of course he has his restaurant and his new phone. He also has a five-\nroom apartment, which is big by Fuling standards. He has a color television\nand a stereo and a 35mm camera. He has one son. He has his family, and his\nfamily has the patronage and respect of the students and the East River\npeople, who see the Huangs as generous and good-hearted. Their world is\nsmall, but they take good care of it.\n\nIT IS EARLY MORNING and Huang Xiaoqiang is making chaoshou. He\nsits in front of the ingredients: a bowl of pork filling, a plate of small square\ndough wrappers, a bowl of water, a pan. He holds a chopstick. He picks up a\nwrapper in one hand. With the chopstick he draws out a pinch of pork filling\nand places it in the square of dough. Then he dips the chopstick in the water,\nand uses it to fold the corners of the wrapper around the meat. The finished\ndumpling extends in two points, one crossing on top of the other. He drops\nthe dumpling into the pan.\nElsewhere in China this food is called hundun, but the Sichuanese have\ntheir own way of speaking, and they call it chaoshou—“crossed hands”—\nbecause of the way the corners of the dumpling overlap. In most parts of\nSichuan, you can walk into a restaurant and order chaoshou without making a\nsound. Cross your arms and they will understand exactly what you want.\nIt takes Huang Xiaoqiang less than five seconds to make the dumpling.\nHe picks up another wrapper, inserts the meat, wets the corners, folds them\nover, and drops the chaoshou into the pan. It looks exactly the same as the\nfirst one. He makes another, and then one more. Outside the sun is rising and\nthe minibuses are honking and the fruit women have set up their stands.\nOranges are in season. Huang Xiaoqiang makes more chaoshou. All of them\nare well-made and they look exactly alike.\n\nCHAPTER NINE\n\nMoney\nMONEY MEANT VERY LITTLE TO ME IN FULING. I made one\nthousand yuan a month, while the average per capita income for a Chinese\nurban household was 430 yuan—fifty-odd American dollars, at the official\nexchange rate of slightly more than eight yuan to the dollar. In rural areas the\nper capita income was only 175 yuan a month, but peasants could stretch\nmoney farther because they grew their own food.\nMy salary was relatively high, and it was comfortable as long as I didn’t\ntravel much. A ticket on the hydrofoil to Chongqing cost eighty yuan,\nalthough you could save money by taking the overnight slow boat for twenty-\nfour yuan, which was how most of the locals traveled. During my first year I\nalways rode the slow boat upstream, until one evening when a rat ran over\nmy head while I was sleeping.\nI woke up and turned on the light. There were rats all over the cabin—fat\nbrown Yangtze rats with long noodle tails. They scampered across the floor,\nrooting in people’s luggage. One of them was climbing over a sleeping\nwoman in a lower berth. The woman shifted under her covers but didn’t wake\nup. I watched the rats for a while. At last I left the cabin.\nThe rest of the night I sat out on deck, listening to the river slip past. I\nthought about the money I was saving by taking that boat, which amounted to\nseven dollars. After that trip I always paid extra for the hydrofoils when I\nwent upriver, but these were rare occasions. I had some friends in Chongqing,\nbut otherwise there wasn’t anything interesting about going there. Mostly I\ndidn’t travel.\nStaying in Fuling made it difficult to spend all of my monthly salary,\nwhich was my goal. There was no reason to save it; by living carefully I\ncould put away three hundred yuan a month, which meant that a year of\nfrugality would reward me with a total of four hundred American dollars.\nThat was one of the best aspects of life in the Peace Corps: my salary was so\n\nlow that it was pointless to save money, but my Fuling routines were so\nsimple and cheap that I didn’t have to worry about budgeting my expenses. In\na sense it was the richest I could ever be, because it was like toy money and I\ndidn’t have to think about it at all.\nI wasted a good part of my salary while I wandered around the city,\nbuying anything that caught my eye—books, pictures, trinkets, black-market\ncassette tapes. Once I picked up a bamboo fishing rod for no reason at all and\nput it in the corner of my dining room, where it gathered dust. At the military\nsurplus stores I bought People’s Liberation Army uniforms and accessories.\nThey sold nearly everything at those stores—clothes, shoes, gear. A\nnightstick was 30 yuan; handcuffs cost 130. Anybody with 300 yuan could\nwalk in off the street and pick up a high-powered electric stun gun. If you had\na permission slip from your danwei, you could buy a wicked spiked mace for\nless than 200. They didn’t sell pistols but you could buy the holsters.\nFrom different stores I put my uniform together piece by piece: old-style\nPLA trousers with a red-and-yellow stripe down the leg, a Public Security\nvest, a nice military jacket with padded shoulders, a short-brimmed Red\nArmy cap with a star on the front. When I picked up my epaulets for fifteen\nyuan, the saleswoman told me very seriously that they were the wrong ones\n—apparently there was something else that a waiguoren should wear on his\nshoulders when he dressed up as a PLA officer. I bought them anyway; they\nmatched the star on my cap and the stripes on my trousers.\nOn special occasions I wore my uniform for teaching, which always\nmade the students excited; some of them tried to convince me that I should\nwear it every day. I never wore the entire ensemble into town, but I often\nwore the trousers, which were comfortable. Many of the peasants and stick-\nstick soldiers wore those as well, and sometimes people asked if was a\nUighur.\nApart from the money I wasted, nearly all of my salary went toward food,\nbecause I ate out every meal. The restaurants were among the most pleasant\nplaces in the city, with some of my best friends as their owners, and the\nSichuanese food was excellent. There was no reason to cook for myself in\nFuling.\nAt least once a day I ate at the Students’ Home noodle restaurant. Often I\nate alone, but sometimes during the week all four of the volunteers met there\nfor lunch. We showed Feng Xiaoqin how to cook a Sichuanese version of\n\nspaghetti, and Adam wrote that foreign word on the menu. Nobody else ever\nordered the spaghetti. After they acquired a telephone, Adam and I\nsometimes called to order our meals in advance. This professional touch\npleased the workers, who in turn started telephoning our apartments and\ninviting us to meals. I’d answer the phone and Huang Xiaoqiang would say:\nAre you coming for lunch? What do you want to eat? Adam and I would tell\nhim one bowl of noodles and one bowl of spaghetti, and then we’d run down\nthe hill and catch it hot off the wok.\nI liked the restaurant best on Sunday nights, when it was crowded with\nstudents and the street was full of people enjoying the last of the weekend.\nBut it was also good in the late afternoon, when business was slow and I\ncould sit alone with my newspaper. I’d chat with the family, often about\nmoney, which was what everybody talked about in Fuling. I was accustomed\nto talking about that, even though for me it wasn’t real money and I let it slip\nthrough my fingers every month.\nOne afternoon in December, I sat there watching Huang Kai play on the\nsteps of the restaurant. He was, like all Chinese children in winter, a bundle\nof grubby clothes. His cap and pants had been hand-knit by his mother. His\npants were slit at the crotch, because he had not yet been toilet-trained, and\nhis buttocks and inner thighs were pink in the cold. He was nearly two years\nold. He wore layer upon layer of shirts and sweaters, topped by a fake leather\njacket that his mother had bought in town. “It’s poor quality,” she had said\ndismissively, when I complimented her on it. “It was only twenty yuan.” She\nalways told me the prices of Huang Kai’s clothes and toys.\nI was eating noodles and drinking water from my clear plastic American-\nmade Nalgene bottle. In China those camping bottles were invaluable; they\nwere made of hard plastic that could hold the boiled water that was always\navailable in hotels, restaurants, trains, and boats. When I first arrived in\nSichuan, the bottles had been uncommon, although occasionally in a big city\nlike Chengdu I’d meet a cab driver who had one. Usually it had been\npurchased by a relative or a friend in one of the well-developed coastal cities\nlike Shenzhen.\nIn early spring of 1997, a few Chengdu shops started stocking Nalgene-\nknockoff bottles, and by June everybody had them. Chengdu was a relatively\nhip city where Western styles tended to spread quickly, often without clear\ncause or meaning. Most bicycles in the city had rear fenders decorated with\n\n“Pentium Intel Inside” stickers, the same kind that accompanied computers in\nAmerica. Nearly all of the Chengdu bicycles had only one gear, and they\nmost certainly did not have Intel Inside; but the stickers were trendy and you\nsaw them on fenders everywhere.\nThe demand for Nalgene-knockoff bottles was much more\nunderstandable, especially in a tea-drinking city like Chengdu, where the\nbottles spread quickly throughout the city’s social strata. They were first\nacquired by cab drivers, who tended to be at the forefront of such trends—\ncabbies had a certain maverick quality, as well as plenty of money. After that,\nthe businessmen followed suit, and then the xiaojies, and finally by summer\neven the old people in the teahouses were sipping their tea out of fake\nNalgene bottles. Soon you could buy them for twenty yuan in any Sichuan\ncity or town.\nThe bottles came with a label that described them as American-developed\nTaikong Pingzi—Outer Space Bottles. But they were clearly the product of\nChinese factories, because they weren’t quite standard and often the label was\nmisspelled. In that regard things hadn’t changed greatly from the seventeenth\ncentury, when a Spanish priest named Domingo Navarrete described business\nmethods in China. “The Chinese are very ingenious at imitation,” he wrote.\n“They have imitated to perfection whatsoever they have seen brought out of\nEurope. In the Province of Canton they have counterfeited several things so\nexactly, that they sell them Inland for Goods brought out from Europe.”\nEven after the bottles became common in Fuling, Huang Kai never got\nover the fascination he had with the ones that Adam and I carried. It had\nsomething to do with the shiny plastic, as well as their association with the\nwaiguoren, whom Huang Kai never quite trusted.\nOn that day in December, I shook my bottle and set it on a stool. The\nchild toddled over, cautious but interested.\n“Gupiao,” he said. “Gupiao.”\nThe word meant “stock,” as in stock market. I turned to his mother. “He\nthinks it looks like the stock market report on television,” she said, laughing.\nShe pointed to the side of the bottle, where the volume levels were marked in\ngradients from one hundred to nine hundred milliliters. My water was at five\nhundred and falling.\nHuang Kai forgot the bottle and returned to the steps. He crouched over,\npants gaping, and rolled a toy car along the ground. A moment later I heard\n\nhim babbling to himself. “Mao Zhuxi, Mao Zhuxi,” he said. “Chairman Mao,\nChairman Mao.” I had no idea what had prompted him to say this; there was\na poster of Mao in his living room at home and perhaps he was thinking of\nthat. He was not yet two years old but already plenty was mixed up inside his\nhead.\nCHAIRMAN MAO HATED MONEY. His father—a crafty, grasping\nlandlord—had made quite a bit of it, and partly in reaction Mao Zedong\ndespised anything that had to do with money. As a poor revolutionary he was\nscornful of it, and as the Communist Party’s Chairman he refused to touch it.\nMao was the father of New China, and perhaps it was in reaction to him\nthat the Chinese nowadays spent so much time thinking and talking about\nmoney. Or maybe it was simply that now they had more than ever before,\nwith more ways to earn and spend it, and yet with all that new money it still\nwasn’t enough. Everywhere in Fuling that was what people talked about.\nIt was nothing to be ashamed of; there was no reason to be coy when it\ncame to financial matters. Everybody knew everybody else’s salary, and if a\nfriend had something new—a shirt, a radio, a pen—you asked him how much\nit cost, and he told you. Mentioning money was nearly as routine as the\ntraditional greeting people used in Fuling and other parts of China: Chi fan\nmeiyou? Have you eaten yet? Until recently most of the country had been\npoor, and eating was something the people took real pleasure in, just as they\ntook real pleasure in earning whatever money they could.\nI liked this openness; it helped me understand people’s lives, because I\ncould ask them about their salaries or expenses without offending them. I\nalways told people my own salary—generally it was the second or third\nquestion they asked. By the second year this disclosure was hardly necessary;\nit seemed that everybody in the city already knew. One evening I sat on a\nbench at South Mountain Gate, talking with the crowd that gathered, and\nsomebody asked how much I made every month. Before I could respond,\nanother voice in the crowd shouted out, “He makes one thousand yuan! All of\nthe foreign teachers at the college make that same salary.”\nPeople talked about money all the time, and yet I wouldn’t describe them\nas greedy: the Chinese I knew in Fuling were incredibly and sincerely\n\ngenerous. If I ate a meal with somebody else, he or she paid; that was simply\nhow it worked, and usually there was nothing I could do about it. Our\nstudents were the same way—if they happened to be eating in the Students’\nHome at the same time as Adam and me, they always tried to pay our bill,\ndespite their tight finances. The average student budget was around two\nhundred yuan a month, or twenty-four dollars, which was a significant\nexpense for many of their families. Because most of the college’s students\ncame from poor rural areas, the government gave each one an additional\nstipend of fifty yuan a month.\nAt the noodle restaurant we learned to pay in advance when students\nwere around, although the owners didn’t approve of this. “You’re their\nteacher,” Feng Xiaoqin told me once. “They respect you, and they should pay\nfor your meal. That’s our tradition in China.” She was generous, too; often at\nthe restaurant I ate for free.\nPart of this was simply the “foreign friend” syndrome, but to a lesser\ndegree they were the same way with each other. In particular they were\ngenerous with their families—if a close relative needed money, it was given\nwithout hesitation and with no expectation of repayment. One of my\ngraduated first-year students, Aumur, had taken a teaching job in Tibet,\nwhere the salary was one thousand yuan a month—more than twice what he\nwould have made in the countryside of Sichuan. But Aumur sent half of his\nTibet salary home to his parents, who were peasants, and yet there was not\nthe slightest sense of burden or regret that accompanied this generosity. “It’s\nmy duty,” he said simply, when I asked him about it, and he explained that\nthis was the only way that his younger brother could afford his school tuition\nfees. Aumur’s commitment in Tibet was eight years, and if he left early the\nfines were as high as twenty thousand yuan, but I never heard him complain\nabout the work he was doing to support his parents and brother.\nEverything had a price in Fuling, where fines were a common part of life.\nStudents were fined ten yuan if they failed an exam, two yuan for\nunsatisfactory cleaning of the classroom, and one and a half yuan for\nskipping morning exercises. I knew Peace Corps teachers at another Sichuan\ncollege where a student was fined five hundred yuan—enough money for two\nmonths’ expenses—for publicly holding hands with his girlfriend on campus\nwhile a government delegation was in town.\nAll of this was good preparation for adult life, which also had its share of\n\nfines. Sometimes you even had to pay to take a new job—a sort of reverse\nbonus. Teacher Liao had originally worked in a college in her hometown of\nZigong, but her husband was on the Fuling faculty and after they married she\nwanted to move. She applied for and received a job in Fuling, but that was\nwhen the complications started. The Zigong danwei required a payment of\nfive thousand yuan before it granted her permission to leave, and Fuling\nTeachers College also could have charged her a similar amount before\nallowing her to start work. But Fuling waived the fee—a sign that they very\nmuch wanted Teacher Liao in their Chinese department. She was proud that\nFuling Teachers College had given her a job without charging her a single\nyuan. You had to be a good teacher to get a job like that for free.\nThe going rate for a second child was more than ten thousand yuan, at\nleast in the countryside close to the college. In the city it was rare that\nanybody got to the point where she paid this fine—if a woman was pregnant\nwith her second child, she would be threatened with the loss of her job. If she\ndidn’t work for a state-run danwei, there were other ways of applying\npressure, and having a second child could result in a woman’s being forced to\nundergo sterilization surgery.\nMost of the city residents seemed accustomed to the planned-birth policy,\naccepting its implications without complaint. After all, they spent every day\nnegotiating Fuling’s crowded streets and sidewalks, which made the need for\npopulation control easy to understand. But attitudes were different in the\ncountryside. Out there you could dodge the authorities, and the Chinese had a\nphrase for this evasion—Chaosheng Youjidui, “Guerrilla Birth Team.” A\nwoman might go live with relatives until she had the baby, and then she\nwould return home and pay the fine. It wasn’t so common close to the city,\nwhere the authorities could control things tightly, but the average family size\nincreased as you went farther into the hills.\nOnce I was on the bus with a peasant woman who was returning from\nmarket, and we had the same simple conversation that I had with so many of\nthe dialect speakers. She asked me how much money I made, and where I\nwas from, and why I had come to such a lousy place as Fuling. This was a\ncommon theme in my conversations—people always wondered why a self-\nrespecting waiguoren would live in a place like Fuling for one thousand yuan\na month. I had no answer for that; I wasn’t about to tell them the truth, that\nFuling’s imperfections were part of why I liked the city so much, and that I\n\nfelt rich precisely because I made so little money that I didn’t have to worry\nabout saving anything.\nI told the woman that I had been sent to Fuling by the U.S. government,\nwhich was the simplest way to explain my situation—everybody in China\nunderstood what it meant when a government decided where you worked. I\nasked the woman about her family, and she said she had two children, a\ndaughter and a young son.\n“But don’t you have trouble if you have two children?” I asked.\n“Yes, but not too much. We had to pay a fine.”\n“How much for your son?”\n“Four thousand yuan.”\n“That’s not as much as people pay now, is it?”\n“No. Nowadays they pay more than ten thousand. For us it wasn’t so\nmuch.”\n“That’s good,” I said.\n“It was cheaper back then,” she said nostalgically. “In those days the\nfines weren’t so bad.”\n“Can you save four thousand yuan in a year?”\n“Unless it’s a bad year.”\n“So that’s not too much at all.”\n“No,” she said. “It wasn’t.”\nThe woman sat there smiling, thinking about the four-thousand-yuan son\nwho was waiting for her at home. She arranged the things in her bamboo\nbasket and turned to me again.\n“Do you have a planned-birth policy in your country?”\n“No.”\n“So how many children can you have?”\n“As many as we want.”\n“Really?”\n“Really,” I said. “If you want to have ten children, you can have ten.\nThere’s no limit. But most people only have two, because that’s all they\nwant.”\nThe woman smiled wistfully, shaking her head. I wondered what amazed\nher more—that there was a country where birth wasn’t limited, or that\nAmericans were so foolish as to want only two children. Many of the\npeasants I met seemed inclined to go with the second viewpoint, and\n\nsometimes they had the same reaction to American farming, which to a\nSichuanese peasant seemed to be an incredible combination of luck and\nincompetence. They found it remarkable that the average farmer in a state\nlike Missouri had 292 acres of land, as well as mechanized equipment and the\noccasional government subsidy, and yet there were still years when it was\ndifficult to make ends meet. As far as the peasants were concerned, you had\nto be a particularly bad farmer to ruin a setup like that, just as you had to be\nparticularly foolish to respond to complete procreative freedom by having\njust two children.\nMy students were part of the last peasant generation whose fines had\nbeen minimal. The second-year speaking class had thirty-five students, of\nwhom only two were single children. Those two were free and the rest had\ncost very little, if anything at all. Diana cost one hundred yuan. Davy’s little\nbrother cost three hundred yuan. Rex had a 650-yuan sister, while Julia’s\nbrother was only 190. Jeremy was one hundred yuan. He was the sixth child\nin his family, and the older five had all been girls. That was a very well spent\none hundred yuan if you were a Chinese peasant.\nMany of their families were like that—a string of girls punctuated by a\nboy that marked the end of the children. In those days the fines had been\nminimal, and the peasants still followed the traditional pattern of having\nchildren until there was at least one son. The fines, like everything else\nregarding money were not sensitive subjects. Sometimes I teased Jeremy\nbecause he had cost only one hundred yuan. I offered to buy Julia’s brother\nfor five hundred, so her parents could double their investment, but she only\nlaughed and shook her head.\nMOST OF MY GRADUATED STUDENTS were assigned jobs in the\ncountryside, where they made around four hundred yuan a month—less than\nfifty dollars. It was very little money but the jobs were secure, and they didn’t\nhave to search by themselves. Communist China had no tradition of\nindependent job searches, and the thought of relying on themselves terrified\nmost of my students, who generally accepted the assignments. They also took\nthese positions because they were penalized if they refused the government\njob. If they chose to find work on their own, they had to repay the scholarship\n\nthey had received, which usually amounted to around five thousand yuan.\nDuring my second year, the authorities began to reform these rules, phasing\nout the automatic assignments, but my first group of graduated students was\nstill in the traditional system.\nThe more aggressive students often paid the fine or found some other\nway to avoid the assigned job. Five of the boys took teaching positions in\nTibet—all of them were Party Members, and they went for reasons of\npatriotism as well as money. North, who had been one of the class monitors,\ntook a sales job with the Wu River Hot Pickled Mustard Tuber factory. Two\nof the best girl students found teaching jobs at a private school in the eastern\nprovince of Zhejiang. Anne, the student whose family lived in my building,\nwandered southward—first she worked as a secretary in Kunming, in Yunnan\nprovince, and then she went to Shenzhen, the special economic zone near\nHong Kong.\nShenzhen was a sort of promised land for Sichuanese migrants. People\nmade money quickly there, sometimes without guanxi or education; all you\nneeded was your wits and some luck. There were Shenzhen legends at all of\nthe Sichuan teachers colleges where my Peace Corps friends taught. Students\nwhispered about classmates who, having been thrown out of school for\ncheating or failing exams, went south to Shenzhen and were rich within a\nyear, thankful that the college had tossed them. During my first year, an\nEnglish department student named Don had been kicked out of Fuling for\ncheating, after which he followed the standard expelled student route and\nwent straight to Shenzhen. But in the booming city he struck out—no money,\nno job, no guanxi. And there was no face for Don the next year, when, after\npaying a substantial fine, he returned to the college and resumed his studies.\nThat was the other side of Shenzhen—but there weren’t so many legends\nabout the people who failed. Sometimes you heard about nice Sichuanese\ngirls who turned into prostitutes after running out of money, but mostly you\nheard about the ones who had succeeded.\nAnne sent Adam and me vivid letters from Shenzhen, describing the\n“talent markets” where she had to pay ten yuan to talk with prospective\nemployers. It was a stressful and expensive place to look for a job, and soon\nAnne, who was there with her sister, had spent all of her savings in the\nmarkets. At last they pooled resources to send Anne’s sister into the talent\nmarkets, where she tracked down an interview for a position that called for\n\nEnglish fluency. Anne went to the interview and got the job. She asked for\ntwelve hundred yuan a month; the boss countered with nine hundred; and\nAnne, who had already been rejected enough times, accepted the offer.\nShe had never left the Fuling area before graduation, and now suddenly\nshe was working on her own in what was perhaps the most exciting city in\nChina. Not long after she started her job, she wrote me a letter describing her\nearly days at the office:\nDuring the first two days, only one girl in our office showed her\nhospitality; others acted as if they didn’t notice my exist. I felt very\nlonely. I thought of you—you must have felt lonely in your early stay in\nFuling. I encouraged myself to try to show my anxiety to make friends\nwith them. My efforts ended in success; I was took as one of them soon.\nIn our office there are only eight people. Except the boss (an old man),\nothers are all young girls. They are from three different provinces. Lulu,\nLuyun, Xuli, Lily are from Jiangxi Province; Yi Xiaoying from Hunan,\nLinna from Sichuan. Lulu is the most beautiful, able and shortest girl,\nwho is liked by everyone. Luyun is very kind, who reminds me of\nAirane [a Fuling classmate]. Xuli is a classical beauty, most private\ntelephones from boys are for her. But I don’t like her very much, for her\nword sometimes hurtful. Lily is the other secretary, who came two days\nearlier than me. She leaves us an impression of stupid and irresponsible.\nSo she is not very popular in the office. Xiaoying is the fatest girl\nconcerning much about losing weight. She is very good at computer but\npoor in English. We have an oral contract that she teaches me how to\nuse computer and I teach her English. Linna is the one I can speak\nSichuan dialect with. But Sichuan dialect is so understandable by\neveryone that we don’t have a sense of superiority when speaking it.\nOh! Till now, you still don’t know what our company does. Our\ncompany was just moved from Taiwan several months before. It acts in\nthe field of exporting fashion, costume and shell jewelry. My job is\nkeeping touch with our customers by letters or faxes, receiving purchase\norders, giving order to factories and finding the best company to ship\nproducts to our customers. Since I’m not familiar with my work, Lulu\nhelps me a lot these days.\n\nIF YOU DIDN’T GO TO SHENZHEN, you could make money quickly in\nthe stock market. The Fuling exchange office was next to South Mountain\nGate, a huge room with rows of chairs where people sat and watched the\nstock listings on an enormous digital screen. For a while I used to go there,\nhoping to practice Chinese with the people, but none of them ever talked.\nThey simply stared at the money as it raced across the boards.\nMany of my friends had invested, despite the expensive registration\ndeposit of thirty thousand yuan. This fee was refundable after a certain period\nof time, but it was an enormous amount and people usually pooled their\nresources and registered as a group. Teacher Liao had investments through\none of her relatives, and the family at the Students’ Home had invested\nmoney through Huang Xiaoqiang’s sister. One afternoon they took Huang\nKai to the exchange, because every night the child became excited and\nshouted “Stock!” repeatedly when the ticker appeared on television. But\nwhen confronted with the market’s reality—the crowds of people, the\nflashing billboard, the noise and lights and energy of the place—he burst into\ntears and cried inconsolably until they returned home, where the familiar\nportrait of Chairman Mao decorated the living-room wall.\nOn January 9 of 1998, which was a Friday, my friend Scott Kramer called\nfrom New York and warned me that the Chinese stock market was under\nserious speculation. He worked in emerging markets on Wall Street, and for\nmy sake he always kept an eye on China.\nThat day I had class with Teacher Liao, and I told her it might be a good\ntime to take her money out of the market. She shrugged it off—what did I\nknow?\nThe following Monday, the Shanghai Index fell 9.1 percent and the\nShenzhen Index dropped 7.8 percent. It was one of the worst days in the\nhistory of the Chinese markets, and Teacher Liao lost a thousand yuan. The\nfamily at the Students’ Home lost nearly as much. They told me about it\nwhile I ate lunch, and Huang Kai picked up one of the words and babbled it\nover and over again. “Diele, diele,” he said. “It fell, it fell.” Within a week\nthe family had sold all their stock.\nThe next time I had class with Teacher Liao, she grinned sheepishly as\nshe walked into my office.\n\n“You were right,” she said. “I forgot all about what you said until that\nMonday, when I got home and watched television. But by then it was too late\n—they had already closed the market. Afterward I told my husband that you\nhad known it would happen.”\n“I didn’t know anything,” I said. “But my friend in America thought it\nmight fall. That’s his job and he understands it very well.”\n“We should have listened.”\nI asked her how much she had lost, and she told me. She said everybody\nwas losing money; two years ago the stocks went up all the time but now\nthere hadn’t been a good month all year. I told her I’d keep her updated on\nKramer’s tips.\nANNE HAD ACCESS TO THE COMPANY PHONES in Shenzhen, and\nsometimes at night she called Adam or me. One evening she phoned and\nreported that she had gotten a raise to one thousand yuan, and I congratulated\nher. As time passed, I would find this to be one of the most satisfying aspects\nof teaching, because former students occasionally called to report milestones\nof adulthood and independence. Often these benchmarks had to do with\nmoney: a new raise, a new apartment, a new beeper. Once a student called to\ntell me that he had acquired a cell phone. He told me about the cell phone for\na few minutes and then he mentioned, in an offhand way, that he had also\ngotten engaged.\nI told Anne that now her salary was as high as mine, which made her\nlaugh. But on the phone she sounded a little funny, and finally I asked if\nsomething was wrong.\n“The company has an agent in Hong Kong,” she said slowly. “He often\ncomes here to Shenzhen. He is an old man, and he likes me.”\n“What do you mean by that?”\nSilence. I tried again. “Why does he like you?”\n“Because I am fat.” She giggled nervously on the phone. She was a pretty\ngirl and I knew that she had gained a little weight since graduation, and in\nsome ways this made her even prettier.\n“What do you mean when you say that he likes you because of that?” I\nasked.\n\nSilence.\n“Does he want you to be his girlfriend?”\n“Perhaps.”\n“Is he married?”\n“He is divorced. He has small children in Taiwan, where he is from. But\nhe usually works in Hong Kong.”\n“How often does he come to Shenzhen?”\n“Twice a month.”\n“Is it a big problem?”\n“He always finds a way to be with me.”\n“Will you leave the job?”\n“He says he will help me find a job in Hong Kong if I want one. The\nsalaries are much higher there, you know. He says I can make much more\nmoney if I go to Hong Kong.”\nI breathed deeply and thought about how to handle this. “That sounds like\na very bad idea,” I said slowly. “If you want another job, you should not ask\nhim for help. That will only cause big problems in the future.”\n“I know. I think I would never do that.”\n“You should try to avoid him.”\n“I do,” she said. “And I tell my coworkers to always be with me if he is\nthere.”\n“Do you think it is a big problem?”\n“Not now.”\n“Well, if it becomes a big problem, you should leave the job. That can be\na very bad situation.”\n“I know,” she said. “I don’t think that will be necessary. But it is not such\na good job, and if I have to leave, I will.”\nONE OF TEACHER KONG’S DISTANT COUSINS had been kidnapped\nand sold into marriage in Anhui province. The woman wasn’t a close relative\nof Teacher Kong, but they shared the same family name. We talked about her\nduring a tutorial in which we discussed fanmai renkou, people who were\nbought and sold for money.\nI asked if the woman had been able to escape her husband, and Teacher\n\nKong said that they still lived together. She had been sold in the mid-1980s;\nnow they had been married for more than a decade.\n“She was relatively satisfied,” Teacher Kong said. “Her husband had\nmoney.”\nTo a certain degree this struck me as obvious—after all, he had purchased\nthe woman. But apart from finances, wasn’t she angry about the violation?\n“I’m not sure, because I don’t know her well,” Teacher Kong said. “But I\nthink she wanted to leave Fengdu. She was from a very poor part of the\ncountryside, and you know that it is difficult for a woman to leave a place\nlike that. Usually they aren’t taken by force—they’re tricked. Somebody\nmight promise them a job somewhere else, and once they arrive they’re sold\nas a bride. They’re far from home and there’s nothing they can do. I think\nthat’s what happened to my cousin.”\n“So she never came back?”\n“After about five years she did. At first she was very ashamed—too\nashamed to write. But after a while she got back in contact, and finally she\nmade a visit home. Now she’s been back a few times. She likes her husband.\nQuite a few of them turn out like that, if the women are from very poor places\nlike my cousin. The only serious problems are with the women who are sold\nto idiots, or cripples, or old men. They’re not happy if they have a husband\nlike that, of course. That’s when there’s trouble, but as long as there’s enough\nmoney most of the women aren’t too upset.”\n“Usually they’re taken far from home?”\n“Yes, and sometimes that’s a problem—the husband will live in a very\nremote area, and the women are watched so they can’t get away. Some of\nthem are illiterate and can’t write home, or they don’t know how to travel\nback. Does that happen much in America?”\n“No,” I said. “That doesn’t happen very much in America. I’ve never\nknown anybody who was bought or sold.”\n“It’s not so common anymore in China, either. It was more common in\nthe 1980s, just after the Reform and Opening started. Now it doesn’t happen\nso much, but in the remote areas I’ve heard that sometimes it’s still a\nproblem.”\n\nEVERY YEAR AT THE BEGINNING of the American section of my\nliterature course, we read the Declaration of Independence, which was in the\ntextbooks. The Chinese publisher had included the Declaration because it\nsmacked of revolution, which was always an appropriate subject for Chinese\nstudents. They never would have included the American Constitution or the\nBill of Rights.\nI assigned the chapter, and then I asked the students to write their own\nDeclarations, asserting independence from something that limited them.\nNearly all of the boys declared independence from the college, although a\nfew responses were different. Marx, who was true to his name, declared\nindependence from Money:\nWe are slaves of the money, all of us, this is the case. But we all know\nclearly that money is only the thing that people create. We want our\nfood, coat, car, and all of the things not controled by the money. We\ndon’t want to fight against money, because at least money has given us\nsome convenience. But its harm is much bigger than the remittance. We\nmust get rid of money. Money is the tyrant of our society. We must\nthrow it off.\nNone of the girls wrote about money, and few of them declared\nindependence from the college. Many wanted to be free from their parents—\nthey wrote about how their mothers read their diaries and prevented them\nfrom choosing their friends freely, especially their boyfriends. Quite a few of\nthe girls declared independence from men entirely. One student wrote:\nThe laws and God give each man equality. They give us freedom from\nwant, freedom from fear, freedom of speech, freedom of loving, and so\non. However, my boyfriend almost abolishes the freedom of my speech\nand deed, the freedom of my loving.\nHe is an all-controlling person. He and I are open-minded. He could\nspeak with anyone he would like to. He could play with his “little\nsisters.” He could also laugh and laugh with them. I don’t know around\nhim, how many “little sisters” he has. But he hates my doing these.\n\nBefore our love, I had had many friends. I liked to chat with them, to go\nfor an outing, to have a joke with them, etc. At that time, I don’t know\nwhat’s the meaning of mental pain. I was like a happy bird. Now, when\nhe saws me talk with boys, he must snap at me. Even more, he doesn’t\nshow due respect for my feelings. I lost my friends. I am so alone that\nmy characteristic also changes. Sometimes for trifles, I might fly into a\nrage. I can’t find own original image. I can’t bear his rudeness. So I\ndecide to leave him forever. When he knows my idea, he threatens me.\nHe says, “If you leave me, I will kill you.” My dear! What can I do?\nI still believe laws and God give each man equality. Now I’ll declare\nloudly that I must be independent! Freedom and independence are more\nimportant than anything else in the world, including love!\nNOT LONG AFTER my telephone conversation with Anne, she wrote in a\nletter that the Hong Kong man had cooled in his pursuit of her. She was\nsatisfied with the job, and now a former classmate from Fuling was coming\nto Shenzhen to try her luck. They were to live together, along with Anne’s\nolder sister.\nAnne was always concerned about her sister, who had a tendency to\nbounce from job to job. The last time Adam had spoken with her, she had\ndescribed her sister’s current job, which sounded more or less like part of a\npyramid scheme. Those scams were very common in Shenzhen, as well as\nmany other places in China, and Anne’s sister had naturally found a position\ntoward the bottom of the pyramid. Adam and I both suggested as tactfully as\npossible that Anne should encourage her sister to find a different line of work\n—pyramids were collapsing all over China, and the government was\ncurrently cracking down on them. Anne gave me an update in her letter:\nMy sister’s situation is getting better now. Frankly, she is more\ncapable than me. What she lacks most is luck. Although these days, she\nhas done very bad in getting money, she is successful making friends\nand having experience, which we think will be good for whatever job\nshe may have in future. But my parents, especially my mother doesn’t\nthink so. They are getting worried about her, because she is already\n\ntwenty-five years old now, but still has neither a stable job nor a\nboyfriend. It’s a very funny situation—when they got know that I had a\nboyfriend, they were so upset, even became angry. As I was still a little\ngirl in their eyes—three or four years makes so big a difference!\nI have read every letter (two total) from you for many times; it has\nbeen a great pleasure to “talk” with an elder man who can always come\nup with wise ideas. My father may be a wise man, but I’d rather act like\na spoiled child before him; we seldom talk seriously.\nA couple of weeks later Anne called from work. I asked her about the\nHong Kong man, and she laughed.\n“He likes all women he sees,” she said. “Because of that he is not such a\nproblem.”\nShe told me her job was going well, and I asked how her sister was doing.\n“She is fine.”\n“Does she have a new job?”\n“Yes. She answers the telephone.”\n“What do you mean by that?”\n“People call her,” Anne explained, “and she talks to them.”\n“She has conversations with them?”\n“Yes.”\n“Do many people call?”\n“Yes.”\n“What do they talk about?”\n“About troubles.”\n“What kind of troubles?”\n“About affections!” She giggled after saying this and there was a pause.\n“Does your sister like the job?”\n“I think she likes it.”\n“How is the salary?”\n“She makes six hundred a month,” said Anne. “But if more people call,\nshe makes more money.”\n“Who calls—are they men or women?”\n“I think half are men, half are women. There are many people who call.”\n“Why do they call?”\n\n“Everyone here in Shenzhen has many troubles.”\n“Why is that?”\n“There are many troubles about affections. Some people say there is no\nreal love in Shenzhen. People are too busy with earning money to exist.”\nDURING OUR FIRST YEAR IN FULING, Adam’s best freshman student\nhad been a girl named Janelle. She was so far ahead of the others that there\nwas no comparison, and something about this intellectual distance also set\nher apart socially. She had no friends in the class and spent her time alone,\noften talking with Adam or me to practice her English. At the end of the\nschool year, she seemed depressed, and then for some unknown reason she\nwent home early, missing her final exams.\nAt the start of the second year, Adam had class for the first time and\ncalled roll. Everybody was there except for Janelle, and Adam asked if she\nwas sick. A few students shook their heads. Nobody said anything.\n“Will she be here later?” Adam asked.\n“No,” said Shannon, who was the class monitor. “She will not come back\nthis year.”\n“Why not?”\n“She is dead,” Shannon said, and then he laughed. It was a nervous and\nhumorless sound, the sort of Chinese laugh that was simply a reaction to an\nuncomfortable situation. It wasn’t difficult to distinguish these laughs from\nnormal ones, but nevertheless they always sent shivers down a waiguoren’s\nspine. The students had their heads down and Adam quickly changed the\ntopic. On that day class was a long two hours.\nThe subject was difficult to broach and we never heard much about it,\nbecause none of the students had known Janelle well. All they could tell us\nwas that during the summer she had jumped off a bridge in her hometown.\nWhen the Chinese commit suicide, it’s common for them to jump off things\n—bridges, buildings, cliffs. Sometimes in the countryside they eat pesticide.\nThey tend to do a much more thorough job of killing themselves than\nAmericas do, especially American women, who often take pills and are saved\nby having their stomachs pumped.\nChinese women are more likely to commit suicide than Chinese men.\n\nMore than half of the female suicides in the world take place in China, where\nthe suicide rate for women is nearly five times the world average. China is\nthe only country on earth in which more women kill themselves than men.\nIn Fuling there were plenty of signs that things could be difficult for\nwomen, and Adam and I had strange experiences with women who seemed\nunbalanced. During our first year, a freshman girl used to lurk outside\nAdam’s apartment, accusing him of loving her. Adam tried to reason with\nher, asking why she believed this, and sometimes she said that she had heard\nit from her body. Other times she invented a story about how Dean Fu had\ncalled a meeting and told all of the students about Adam’s interest in her.\nOnce she angrily accused Adam of being too timid to pursue her, and she said\nthat, like all Americans, he was a coward and a liar.\nI had my own troubles with a woman named Miss Ou, who worked in a\ndowntown department store. She was in her mid-forties, unmarried, and she\ntelephoned at strange hours—at six in the morning she would invite me to\ncome and see her. She gave me gifts: chopsticks, books, hand-knit sweaters.\nShe was a kind, harmless woman, and at the beginning I tried to be friendly,\nbut soon I was overwhelmed by her desperate loneliness. Every two or three\nweeks she sent me poetry and brief sayings that she copied out of English\ntextbooks or translated herself. “We open up the future dream together!” she\nonce wrote. “Harmonious family condition is the fatal term of the success of\ncareer.”\nOccasionally she sent me longer letters, like the one entitled “Keep the\nTrees of Love Green Forever”:\nYou should fully realize that woman is the unexhausted source of the\nstrength of man. She can affect him, give him self confidence, lead him\nup, make him exciting, she can make timid brave, make weakness\nstrong. It all depends on how the woman excavate the great potential\npower of her own.\nGood woman is a school, she will affect, encourage, and model you\n(man) with a kind of magical spirit. Benefit you all your life. Man\nshould enter this school to refine himself. The man who has ideal is the\nmost powerful one.\n\nWhile it seemed that Fuling women were far more likely than men to feel\nisolated and frustrated, I had trouble untangling the reasons behind this\nunhappiness. Gender relations were hard to understand very fully, because\nthese were sensitive, private issues and I was an outsider. But even from my\ndistance I sensed an enormous gap between the experiences of local women\nand men.\nIn particular, I noticed that they had vastly different relationships to\nmoney. In my mind, money was a male quality in Fuling—it was something\nthat I naturally associated with men, and to some degree it was connected to\nthe standard dress code that represented local masculinity. City men almost\nnever wore shorts, regardless of how hot it was, and in cool weather they\ndressed carefully in Western-style suits with the tailors label left prominently\non the sleeve. In hot weather they wore bright silk shirts and thin polyester\nslacks. They clipped beepers and cell phones prominently to their belts,\nwhich were wrapped one and a half times around their narrow waists. They\ncarried their money in fat black leather purses. They were finicky about shoes\n—most men wore dark loafers, which they kept well polished. This was part\nof the routine when I had dinner with a group of well-to-do male friends in\ntown: first we would have our shoes shined, all of us sitting on a row of\ncurbside stools, and then we would go to a restaurant.\nSome Fuling men allowed their pinkie nails to grow a full two inches,\nbecause this was a sign that they didn’t do manual labor. A number of my\nmale students had nails like this, which looked absurdly feminine on hands\nthat clearly had been toughened by work in the fields. But none of the\nstudents planned on returning to the peasant life, and their nails were a clear\nindication that their lives were moving forward. Most of the long-nailed men\nin Fuling were of this transitional social class; they tended to be former\npeasants who were finding success as cab drivers, clerks, or small\nentrepreneurs. The truly rich rarely grew out their nails, because their wealth\nwas already obvious enough from their expensive suits and cell phones.\nThe pinkie nails, like so many male accouterments, represented money—\nindeed, men in banks and shops occasionally used their elongated nails to\ncount out bills. Fuling women also had their share of accessories that showed\nthey were from the upper class, but on the whole these indications were less\nbluntly obvious and materialistic than those of the men. Upper-class males\n\neven wielded their leather purses in a far more showy manner than the\nwomen ever did. When one of these men paid a bill, he would ostentatiously\nopen his purse, allowing bystanders to see a fat wad of cash.\nIt was clear that men controlled most of the money—they were quicker to\nearn it, quicker to spend it, and quicker to talk about it. They had more\nopportunities than the women, who were less likely to go into business or\nfind lucrative independent jobs like driving a cab. In the end, money simply\nmeant more to the men. I had trouble imagining what Fuling men had been\nlike before Reform and Opening, because money struck me as such a\nfundamental part of their identity.\nAnd it could be a distinctly tedious part, at least in my eyes. After a year\nin the city, I found that I least enjoyed associating with one particular\nsocioeconomic group: the young moneyed male. There were exceptions, of\ncourse, but when I tried to define the average person from this group, I saw a\nman driven by a set of goals and aspirations that were so narrow they became\na sort of caricature of showy masculinity. He tended to be passionate about\nacquiring beepers and cell phones, and he worked hard to accumulate\nincreasingly advanced videodisc players and karaoke machines. He smoked\nMagnificent Sound cigarettes constantly. He tended to be loud, and he was\nvery conscious of face, carrying himself with a certain swagger. On\nweekends he sometimes engaged in senseless drinking competitions with his\nmale friends, challenging each other to shot after shot of baijiu. If he wanted\nsome illicit excitement, he found prostitutes at a karaoke bar or a beauty\nparlor.\nI realized that this was an unfairly narrow prejudice, and during my\nsecond year in Fuling I became friends with several wealthy young men who\ndidn’t match this stereotype. But nevertheless I found that it was easiest to\nmake friends from the middle and lower classes. I was far more comfortable\nwith somebody like Teacher Kong, who was thoughtful, interesting, and not\nin the least materialistic, and most of my boy students lacked the swagger of\nthe Fuling rich. Even a small entrepreneur like Huang Xiaoqiang, who clearly\nspent a lot of time thinking about money, wasn’t inclined to present the sort\nof macho facade that was standard among relatively wealthy men. In fact, this\nfacade was often only skin deep, and it merely took time to penetrate beyond\nit; but in the end I didn’t have the patience. Apart from a few exceptions, I\nessentially wrote off that entire class of people.\n\nI also developed these prejudices from looking at my own behavior as a\nman in Fuling, especially when I participated in the macho routines that\nplayed such a large role in local upper-class male lives. During our second\nyear, Adam and I both became tired of the banquet routine—the senseless\ncompetitive drinking, the constant bullying, the baijiu strategy. It had been\nentertaining during the first year, largely because we had so few social\noutlets, and some of the banquets were among my most humorous memories.\nBut they were also some of the most embarrassing. For Christmas of my\nsecond year, the college held a banquet that coincided with a visiting\ndelegation of cadres from Chongqing. As far as alcohol consumption went, it\nwas hard to imagine a more auspicious coincidence than cadres and\nChristmas—that was like having nine planets line up at exactly the same\ntime. From the moment I first heard about this event I knew that it would be\nugly.\nThere were more than thirty cadres at the banquet, and by the time the\nparade of holiday toasts was finished, Adam and I were shouting Sichuanese\nswear words and firing toy plastic pellet guns at each other from across the\nrestaurant. At least this was what I later heard; I had no memory of the last\ntwo hours and only knew what Sunni and Noreen told me (they also handled\ntheir share of toasts on that evening, although most of the attention had been\nfocused on Adam and me).\nIn another culture I would have woken up mortified, but that was the least\nof my concerns the next morning. I was hungover, and badly bruised, but I\nknew there was no point in making apologies, because none was expected.\nProbably every single cadre had made a jackass of himself at some banquet\nwithin the past year, and without question their enjoyment of the event had\nbeen heightened by Adam and me being out of control. That was where the\npellet guns came from, after all—a visiting foreign friend suggested the gift\nand the cadres instantly recognized their potential as a Christmas present.\nSomebody bought the guns on the street, loaded them, and put them in our\nhands.\nAlcohol was always a viable excuse for bad male behavior in Fuling.\nOnce in my first year I was eating dinner by myself in the college cafeteria\nwhen a group of three drunk physical education students came to my table,\ntaunting and laughing at me. I tried to ignore them, but they just pressed\ncloser, brushing against me while their insults became louder. Finally I stood\n\nup, and for a moment a fight seemed likely, but the cafeteria staff stepped in\nand escorted the students out. But that was all the staff did—they didn’t take\nany names, or alert the college authorities. They made sure the students left,\nand then they apologized to me and explained that the three young men had\nbeen drunk. In their view, that was all that needed to be said—the drunk\nstudents weren’t responsible for what they did.\nWhile male drinking occasionally led to aggression, I mostly disliked its\ntediousness. When I looked back at the most vivid banquet of my first year,\nwhen the literary magazine had recruited me to write my Dickens essay, I\nsaw it as a humorous incident but also as one that was full of wasted\nopportunities. The table had been full of intelligent, well-educated people,\nand yet virtually all of the evening’s energy had been focused on making\nTeacher Sai drink when he did not want to. It reminded me of high school\nparties, except these men were in their forties and fifties. After the Christmas\nbanquet in our second year, Adam and I finally took the original Peace Corps\nadvice and refused to participate anymore in the competitive drinking.\nBut this was a decision that we had to make ourselves, because nobody\nexpected us to behave responsibly and not act like drunken fools. In the end,\nthis was probably my strongest prejudice toward men in Fuling, and\nespecially upper-class men—on the average, I didn’t see their lives being\nshaped by particularly high expectations. It was like any extremely male-\ndominated culture in which men are given more leeway than is healthy, and\nin Fuling it became even more pronounced when male pride was swollen\nwith financial success.\nWhile I typically avoided associating with wealthy men, there were\nmoments when I was tempted to extend this prejudice to all young men.\nAgain, this was an attitude that I tried to resist, but to a large degree it was a\nnatural reaction to all of Fuling’s anti-foreigner harassment, which invariably\ncame from young males. Every single day that I spent in the city, people\nshouted at me, and probably less than 5 percent of these catcalls came from\nwomen. Generally it was the result of men trying to be macho: if I saw three\nyoung men walking toward me, I could be almost certain that one of them\nwould shout something at me to impress his friends. In that sense it was\nsimilar to any sort of harassment in America, which typically comes from\nyoung men, but in Fuling it was far more routine.\nIt didn’t take me very long to come to the conclusion that men were far\n\nmore likely to give me trouble than women, and I shaped my routines\naccordingly. If I went shopping and saw two people selling the same thing, I\ninvariably went to the woman first, because there was a much lower chance\nthat she would cheat me or mock me. I knew other Peace Corps volunteers\nwho followed the same pattern; it was a prejudice, but one that stemmed from\nexperience.\nAll of these reactions and prejudices made it even more difficult for me to\nsort out gender relations in Fuling. My own life was contradictory: while I\ninstinctively learned to be more wary of males, I nevertheless found that my\nclosest friends were men, and I was far less comfortable associating with\nwomen on a one-to-one basis. If you were a male waiguoren in a small\nSichuan city like Fuling, there were tacit barriers that stood between you and\nthe women, and I avoided crossing these divides because I didn’t want to find\nmyself in trouble. The Peace Corps staff had all but formally recommended\nthat we avoid dating in these small towns, because people were so skittish\nabout waiguoren. But even if there hadn’t been such a recommendation, I\nwould have seen at a glance that such matters would be complicated, and it\nwas something that all of the male Peace Corps volunteers in my group took\nseriously. There were seven single men, and over the course of two years not\none of us had a romantic relationship with a Chinese woman.\nAs a result, local women were always somewhat mysterious and foreign,\nwhich was probably why xiaojie was one of the first Chinese words that\nAdam and I incorporated into our everyday English speech. It meant “miss”\nor “young woman,” but it also conveyed the foreignness of the women in\nFuling, as well as the barrier that we felt because we were waiguoren. In fact\nthis is a term adopted by virtually every foreigner living in China, partly\nbecause young women workers are ubiquitous in certain jobs—as waitresses,\nshop assistants, train attendants—where they are addressed simply as xiaojie.\nBut at the same time there’s a complicated vagueness to this term, because it\ncan also refer to the sort of young women who can be found in karaoke halls\nor suspicious beauty parlors. People in Fuling spoke of san pei xiaojie\n—“three-with girls,” who worked in karaoke halls. Men could drink with\nthem, sing karaoke with them, and dance with them. And for enough money\nsome of the three-with girls would perform a fourth “with,” sleeping with the\ncustomer.\nIt was impossible to define exactly what xiaojie meant, because it\n\nstretched across a broad range of implication. Anne was a xiaojie and so was\nLi Jiali, the prostitute who had pursued me at the teahouse. Xiaojie was a\nvague term, which was appropriate because it was difficult to define exactly\nwhat was expected of young women in a place like Fuling. They weren’t like\nyoung upper-class men, whose aspirations could be neatly summarized, and I\nfound that I had no equivalently simple definition for the average young\nwoman in Fuling. She was expected to marry young and promptly have her\nchild, and yet her childbearing was strictly and legally limited. She was\nexpected to have a job and earn money of her own, but job discrimination\nwas even more severe than in America. Traditional morality was breaking\ndown, but this happened unevenly and in unhealthy ways; prostitution was\nbecoming increasingly common and so were love affairs. I was amazed at\nhow many of my young married friends in the city were cheating on their\nspouses, but divorce still came with a definite stigma for the women\ninvolved.\nWhen a woman had an affair with a married man, people said that she tou\nren, or tou hanzi—“stole men.” There was no equivalent phrase that meant to\nsteal women. If a single man had a romantic relationship with a married\nwoman, people described her as shuixing yanghua—“as fickle as the way the\nwater flows and the willow seed blows.” Again, this phrase couldn’t be\napplied to men; even the language did its part to protect them from being\nblamed for their indiscretions. Other aspects of Chinese were even more\nbluntly sexist. If you wanted to call a woman a bitch, you could say that she\n“stunk three-eight,” because March 8 is International Women’s Day.\nFuling women lived under complicated expectations, and the economic\npressures of Reform and Opening seemed to weigh particularly heavily on\nthem. In the countryside, many of the men had left to work in urban areas,\nand for every stick-stick soldier or construction worker in the city, there was\na peasant wife back at home, tending the farm alone. A total of 66 percent of\nChina’s agricultural workers are female. Social scientists believe that this\nimbalance is partly responsible for the high female suicide rate, which occurs\npredominantly in the countryside. Rarely do these rural deaths seem to be the\nresult of poverty; in fact, most happen within a relatively affluent and well-\neducated class of peasants. Adam’s student Janelle was a textbook example\nof this trend: she wasn’t poor, and she had academic opportunities that were\nunusual for peasant girls. But Janelle’s career path most likely would have\n\ninvolved returning to her hometown to teach, which probably had been a\ndepressing prospect for somebody so bright. I suspected that she had\nrecognized clearly her own potential, as well as the bleakness of her future: to\nbecome a rural schoolteacher, marry young, raise a child. In the end it was\nmore—or less—than she could bear.\nOf course, things were worse in other parts of the world. Women in\nChina could go much further than in most developing countries; there was no\ncomparison with the Middle East. Also, there had been clear improvements in\nChina, where post-Liberation reforms had made it easier for women to work,\nand the Communists had always campaigned hard against wife-selling while\nsupporting women’s right to divorce. Chinese women were also much better\neducated than ever before—but in a sense this only served to make them\nmore aware of their plight. Like so many aspects of Chinese life, the issue of\nwomen’s independence had reached a transitional stage, and it seemed to be a\nparticularly painful one.\nEverything was further complicated by the influence of traditional\ncollective thinking. The longer I lived in Fuling, the more I was struck by the\nview of the individual—in my opinion, this was the biggest difference\nbetween what I had known in the West and what I saw in Sichuan. For people\nin Fuling, the sense of self seemed largely external; you were identified by\nthe way that others viewed you. That had always been the goal of\nConfucianism, which defined the individual’s place strictly in relation to the\npeople around her: she was somebody’s daughter, somebody else’s wife,\nsomebody else’s mother; and each role had its specific obligations. This was\nan excellent way to preserve social harmony, but once that harmony was\nbroken the lack of self-identity made it difficult to put things back together\nagain. I sensed this whenever I read personal accounts of victimization during\nthe Cultural Revolution, because these stories were surprisingly full of shame\n—one day a person was a good Communist, and the next day the winds\nchanged and he was a mortified Counter-Revolutionary forced into the\n“airplane” stance at a rally, his arms outstretched and bent painfully back.\nThe shift in itself was not so remarkable—irrational political purges\nhappened the world over—but the strange part was that so many of these\nvictims were racked by shame, clearly believing that they were somehow\nflawed. It was like a target of McCarthyism immediately breaking down and\nadmitting that he was wrong, or a Holocaust victim hating herself because\n\nshe was indeed a “dirty Jew.” Often it seemed that in China there was no\ninternal compass that was able to withstand these events.\nGroup thought could be a vicious circle—your self-identity came from\nthe group, which was respected even if it became deranged, and thus your\nsense of self could fall apart instantly. There wasn’t a tradition of anchoring\none’s identity to a fixed set of values regardless of what others thought, and\nin certain periods this had contributed to the country’s disasters. The Cultural\nRevolution showed how Chinese society could become completely unhinged,\nbut to a lesser extent there were bound to be problems during any sort of\ntransitional period. And in recent decades nothing had been more disruptive\nto social roles and expectations than Reform and Opening\nGroup mentality seemed particularly troublesome for women, who lived\nunder a strange combination of strictness and uncertainty. When compared to\nmen, their traditional role in Chinese society was much more narrow, but the\nnew economy resulted in frighteningly vague expectations and demands. On\nthe whole these changes were undoubtedly positive, but they were happening\nso quickly that freedom could easily look overwhelming to somebody who\nwas caught in the middle.\nAnd often there wasn’t anywhere to turn for help. Time and time again I\nsaw this with my classes; for the most part they were incredibly close and\nsupportive, but they could be cruelly isolating when a member was somehow\ndifferent. Nobody had ever shown any interest in Janelle, and every class had\nat least one student who seemed alone; more often than not it was a girl.\nBeing different wasn’t liberating, as it sometimes is in America, and this was\nespecially true for women from a peasant background, who were unlikely to\nfeel comfortable ignoring the opinions of others and blazing new ground. The\nresult was that they became outsiders not so much by choice as by helpless\ninclination, which naturally made them feel that they were the ones at fault.\nTo some degree, Anne had been like this. She had never quite fit in with\nthe others, but she was also very bright, socially gifted, and attractive. In the\nend, these qualities gave her enough confidence to ignore certain aspects of\nthe group. But Janelle was only extremely intelligent, which probably served\nto sharpen her sense of isolation.\nOften money lay at the heart of these stresses. Peasant women saw their\nhusbands go off in search of work, gaining financial security but leaving their\nspouses isolated, and sometimes this loneliness destroyed them. Women\n\ncould earn money themselves; this was a way of becoming independent, but a\ncareer could also result in the frustration of sexism and the criticism of people\nwho felt that a woman shouldn’t strive in this way. A woman like Anne could\ngo south to Shenzhen, where there was money; but Shenzhen money could be\nearned in many ways. There were xiaojies who worked as secretaries and\nthere were three-with xiaojies. xiaojies like Li Jiali and xiaojies like Anne.\nAll of them were doing whatever they could to earn money. And they were\nsurrounded by plenty of men who had sold their souls long ago, and often the\nwomen had to negotiate this uncertain world alone.\nAT THE END OF THE SEMESTER, before the Chinese New Year, Miss\nOu slipped an envelope under my door. Inside the envelope was a letter, a\ncopy of her health certificate, and five hundred yuan. The letter was in broken\nEnglish:\nDear Pete,\nHow long have to see you, where you has gone recently?\nPlease remember: “First thing first.” Can you tell me. May I help\nyou?\n“Make every-thing risk must rise early.”\n“Take a chance! All life is a chance the man who goes furthest is\ngenerally the one who is willing to do and dare.”\n“Although language isn’t complete interlinked, it isn’t\nmisunderstood to express love.”\n“The best relationships are these which we create at our own\nexpense with our own honesty and understanding.”\nBecause not easy, so we should double cherish.\n“Miracles sometimes occur, but one has to work terribly hard for\nthem.”\n“Bold and mighty forces will come to your aid.”\n“A good wife and health is a man’s best wealth.” “Happiness is\nbeing married to your best friend.”\n“Think more and become wiser.” Your own are wonderful!\nMay I ask a favor of? I sure you able to do something. I’m sorry to\n\ntrouble you, I do appreciate your kindly help. Please to my home have\nfood, spend Spring Festival together, shall we? The best of luck to you!\nSincerely,\nOu Xiaomei\nP.S. This is my health certificate.\nThe health certificate noted that she was 1.70 meters tall and weighed\nsixty-seven kilograms. There weren’t any problems with her heart, chest, or\nlungs. Her teeth, nose, and ears were also good. She was listed at thirty years\nof age, which was not true; the certificate was a photocopy of the original and\nobviously this detail had been doctored. But everything else looked accurate.\nOn the upper right corner of the health certificate was a photograph of\nMiss Ou. The picture was at least twenty years old. It was a small black-and-\nwhite snapshot of a much younger Miss Ou wearing heavy-rimmed glasses\nand neatly curled hair. She was smiling in the photograph, a pretty young\nwoman who looked at the camera with confidence.\nThe one-hundred-yuan notes were folded neatly in half. It was more than\nhalf of what Miss Ou made in a month. Even in America it was a good sum,\nsixty bucks, but in Fuling you could eat for two months on five hundred\nyuan. If you had that much money twenty times over, you could buy yourself\na second child.\nI WAS AFRAID OF MISS OU and rarely dealt with her directly. During\nthe first year I had learned that directness only encouraged her; once I asked\nher firmly to stop coming to my apartment at night, and she became very\nexcited and showed up every evening for the next week. Like all of my Miss\nOu stories, it seemed funny when told out of context, but when it happened I\nwas only annoyed and depressed by how desperately unhappy she seemed.\nI took the money to Fei Xiaoyun, who worked in a different section of the\nsame department store as Miss Ou. Fei Xiaoyun was possibly the prettiest\nxiaojie I knew in town, as well as one of the kindest; she had been one of the\n\nfirst to talk with Adam and me when our Chinese was still bad. I often\nstopped to chat with her when I went into town, and I knew that she would\nunderstand the problem with Miss Ou. I gave her the money and explained\nthe situation.\n“You know that soon it’s the Spring Festival,” Fei Xiaoyun said. “There\nare many Chinese traditions at this time of year, and one of them is to give\npeople money. So that’s probably why she gave it to you—she just wants to\nshow her kindness.”\nYears ago, Fei Xiaoyun had been a student at the college, and because of\nthat the sound of her Mandarin was very pleasant. I listened to her clear tones\nand then I shook my head.\n“During the Spring Festival people give money to children,” I said. “I\nunderstand that tradition. But I’m not a child and you don’t give this kind of\nmoney to an adult. Would it be appropriate if I gave you five hundred yuan\nbecause you’re my friend?”\n“No,” she said. “That wouldn’t be appropriate.”\n“It’s the same way with this money. I think it’s very strange and it\nembarrasses me.”\n“Yes,” she said, sighing. “It is a little strange.”\nThat was what I liked the most about Fei Xiaoyun—she didn’t feel the\nneed to lie to me just because I was a waiguoren. She had enough sympathy\nfor Miss Ou to try to defend her, but at the same time she understood where I\nwas coming from. Sadly she looked at the bills in the envelope.\n“Will you please help me and give that back to Miss Ou?” I asked.\n“Yes. I’ll be sure to do that.”\n“You can tell her that I’m sorry I can’t accept it. But please don’t\nencourage her—I don’t want her to bother me anymore. I don’t want to be\nrude, but I don’t want her to call me or come to my apartment again.”\n“I understand. I’ll try to tell her that.” But I could see that Fei Xiaoyun\nknew it was hopeless. Miss Ou was one of those who had slipped beyond the\npale, and there wasn’t much that you could do about people like that. I\nassumed that whenever I left Fuling for good there would be some kind of\nminor hassle with Miss Ou, which was precisely the way it would happen.\nBut standing there in the department store I didn’t worry too much about the\nfuture. In Fuling I always dealt with problems one at a time, and right now\nthe most important issue was to give the money back.\n\nI thanked Fei Xiaoyun and wished her a happy Spring Festival. She\nsmiled, placing the envelope in her desk, and a couple weeks later she\nreported that she had returned it successfully. I put Miss Ou’s health\ncertificate in a folder where it could be forgotten. But sometimes I found\nmyself thinking about the old photograph, and I wondered why the young\nwoman had never married, and what had happened to make her the way she\nwas today. For some reason I never threw the photograph away.\n\nTHE TEACHER\n“EVERYBODY NEEDS SOME KIND OF FAITH,” says Kong Ming.\n“Whether it’s religion, or Capitalist Democracy, or Communism—regardless\nof what the faith is, everybody needs something. My faith is the Communist\nParty. I first wanted to join when I was a college student, but at that time I\nwasn’t accepted.”\nTeacher Kong is a Party Member and a former peasant and a current\ninstructor of Ancient Chinese Literature in the Chinese department of Fuling\nTeachers College. He is thirty-three years old, and there are a few streaks of\nsilver in his black hair. He has a soft smile that is shadowed by the barest hint\nof a mustache on his upper lip. He knows a great deal about Han Dynasty\npoetry, and his three-year-old son has the given name Songtao, which means\n“waves of pines”: the sound a pine forest makes when the wind blows.\n“It’s a common phrase in Chinese poetry,” Teacher Kong explains. “It\nwas also used once by Shelley—I read it in translation. There’s a poem he\nwrote about a forest, where he describes the trees making that same sound. I\nthink the forest was in Italy but I’m not certain.”\nThere are only 58 million Party Members in all of China—less than 5\npercent of the population. For more than a decade, Teacher Kong was\ninterested in joining, but it wasn’t until last year that he was finally accepted,\nafter a formal application and a series of interviews and evaluations that took\nmonths to complete. “In the past they used to look more carefully at your\nhome and your family,” he says. “Your background was very important. But\nthat’s not the way it is now—they look at your ideas instead, which is better.\n“I think the basic goals of Communism—to help the poor, to make things\nequal—I think those are good goals. The Party certainly has problems, of\ncourse, and some people join for selfish reasons. They want more power, and\nafter they become Party Members they only care about themselves. That’s\nnot good—that’s why we have corruption, because a few people only care\n\nabout themselves. And if the Communist Party gets worse and worse, of\ncourse the common people won’t believe in it. This is the biggest problem\nright now. But I believe that most people still support the Party, and I\ncertainly agree with its ideas. There always will be some problems, but the\nfundamental goals are good.”\nONE OF THE FUNDAMENTAL GOALS of the Chinese Communist\nParty has always been stability for the average citizen, which traditionally has\nbeen maintained through the system of state-run work units. Teacher Kong’s\ndanwei is the college, and as a result his life has none of the scramble and\nuncertainty of the entrepreneur. His three-room apartment is owned and\nmaintained by the college, which rents it for roughly thirty yuan a month—a\nsum so small that its payment is essentially a formality. The college also\nprovides Teacher Kong with health insurance, as well as a retirement\npension. At less than eight hundred yuan, his monthly salary isn’t high, but\nthe big perk is security, because it’s unheard-of for the college to fire an\nemployee. Teacher Kong has what Americans would call tenure, except that\ntraditionally in Communist China such tenure has been given the moment\nyou start your job, and it has been given to everybody who works for a state\ndanwei: teachers, government officials, post office employees, train\nattendants, dock laborers, factory workers. Under Chinese Communism, all\nof them have job security—“the iron rice bowl.”\nBut already this term is slipping into the past tense, and people in Fuling\ntend to use it in one of two ways. Usually it is heavy with irony, as locals\nemphasize a wasteful system that needs further reform; but there are still\nthose who use it nostalgically as they describe something comfortable that is\nsteadily disappearing. The way this term is used depends on where one stands\nin the danwei system, and increasingly the government is adopting the more\ncritical viewpoint of the iron rice bowl. As a result, no rice bowl is entirely\niron, and no danwei is without reform, and never is Socialism without those\nChinese Characteristics that are developing into a strange marriage of\nCommunism and Capitalism, constantly shifting and redefining the\nparameters of lives like Teacher Kong’s.\nThe first major change will hit him later this year, in June of 1998, when\n\nhis apartment will be privatized. No longer will he enjoy the formality of a\nthirty-yuan rent payment; instead, the apartment’s fifty-four square meters\nwill be sold to him for a little more than ten thousand yuan. It’s a good price\n—but nevertheless a lot of money for a man who makes eight hundred yuan a\nmonth, and whose wife makes even less as a freelance photographer. There\nis, of course, the possibility that the apartment’s value will rise, providing\nTeacher Kong with a profit in the long run—but nothing in the past has\ntaught him to see an apartment as an investment. Nobody in Fuling speaks of\nmortgages and refinancing, and it’s unheard of for a common citizen to get a\nloan from a bank. To make a big purchase, you pay from your own savings,\nor you borrow from family and friends—or, if the money can’t be found, you\ndon’t buy at all.\nOther cracks are spreading across the iron bowl. Already the government\nhas decided that the danwei insurance system will be reformed. The details of\nthis change have yet to be determined, but probably Fuling’s teachers will\nhave to buy their own policies from China’s fledgling insurance companies.\nAnd soon Teacher Kong and his wife, Xu Lijia, will have to deal with the\nissue of schooling. Elementary schools in the East River district charge the\nstandard fees—more than one hundred yuan per semester in tuition, along\nwith book and uniform charges. Such expenses are not difficult to bear, but\nthe quality of public education in Fuling has started to vary widely, because\nschools with good reputations can charge higher tuition fees, thus paying\nhigher salaries to keep top-rate teachers. The East River institutions are\nslipping in this competitive environment, and most teachers at the college\nchoose to send their children to downtown schools. But such transfers are\nincreasingly expensive—a few years ago it cost eight thousand yuan to\nchange districts, and now the one-time fee has leaped to twelve thousand.\nHow much higher will it be in three years, when Kong Songtao is ready for\nschool? And is it worth the money? Are there other Characteristics that will\ncrop up in the once-stable world of the Socialist danwei, leading to more\ndifficult decisions for the family? And will these changes ever reach the point\nwhere Teacher Kong no longer speaks of Communism as a xinyang, a faith?\nBUT EVEN AMID THESE CHANGES, Teacher Kong is not particularly\n\nworried. Decisions will be made when necessary; in the meantime, he teaches\nancient Chinese literature and watches his son grow up. This equanimity has\nnothing to do with Teacher Kong’s status as a Party Member, committed to\nthe government’s policies. Instead, he is calm for the same reason that so\nmany other Chinese are strangely placid in the midst of changes that seem\noverwhelming to outsiders. Quite simply, he has seen far worse.\n“When I was a boy we didn’t have enough to eat,” says Teacher Kong.\n“Especially in 1972 and 1973—those were very bad years. Part of it was that\nwe lived in a remote place where the land wasn’t very good, but also there\nwere some problems associated with the Cultural Revolution—problems with\nproduction and agricultural methods. It was a little better later in the 1970s,\nbut still it wasn’t too good. We never ate meat; I was always hungry. Every\nday we ate rice gruel, and we only had a little bit of that. Rarely did we have\nsalt. We ate weeds, wildflowers, pine needles—I’ve eaten all those things.\n“My mother died when I was five, after she gave birth to my sister. Of\ncourse, we didn’t have milk or anything like that to help the baby, who died\nas well. I don’t remember that. But at the age of ten my father died, which I\ndo remember. He got sick suddenly, a very bad cold, and in three days he was\ndead.\n“After that, things were even worse. My grandfather wasn’t strong\nenough to work, and I was too young to do much, so my uncle had to support\nall of us. At that time the Production Team in that village was very bad, and\nthey weren’t of any help. Later, things improved and they were able to assist\nus, but for many years it was terrible.”\nAll of Kong Ming’s early life took place in the mountains outside\nFengdu, a town that nowadays has about thirty thousand residents. From his\nchildhood home it took an hour by foot to reach the nearest road, which was\nthree hours by rough bus ride from Fengdu, and as a result Kong Ming never\nsaw the town until he was fourteen years old. He helped his uncle farm the\nland, where they grew wheat and corn on the slopes, rice in the paddies, and\nvegetables where they could. “The work didn’t seem hard back then,” he\nsays, “but it would be hard now, because I’m not used to it anymore.” He\nlooks at his hands and smiles, for now they are the hands of a teacher—ink-\nstained and soft, the dirt and calluses long gone.\n“I go to the countryside now,” he says, “and I can’t believe how hard the\nwork looks, even around the suburbs of Fuling, where the peasants are\n\nrelatively well off. I can’t believe I used to live in a place like that. And I see\nthe students here at the college, most of whom are from peasant families, and\nI want to tell them that they shouldn’t waste their parents’ money. So many\nof our students are from backgrounds like mine, but they’ve already forgotten\nhow hard the work is. On weekends they go out and waste so much money.”\nOnly a few of his middle-school classmates made it to high school, and\nnone of the others tested well enough to go to college. He was admitted to\nSichuan Teachers College, a four-year institution in Chengdu that is the top\nteachers college in the province. After graduating in 1988, he taught in a\nFengdu trade school for six years, and then he was offered a job in Fuling.\nAlmost anybody in America who has made a rise like Teacher Kong’s\nwould be full of the confidence—and perhaps the arrogance—of the self-\nmade man, but it is characteristically Chinese that such pride is completely\nabsent. He rarely talks about his background, and he never emphasizes its\ndifficulty, because he knows that things easily could have been worse.\n“My family never had any trouble during the Cultural Revolution,” he\nsays, when asked about political problems. “We were too poor. After\nLandlords, there were three types of peasants: Rich Peasants, Middle\nPeasants, and Poor Peasants. We were very poor—when you were as poor as\nwe were, you didn’t have anything to worry about during the Cultural\nRevolution. As long as you didn’t steal something, or kill somebody, or\ncommit another crime, there wasn’t anything to worry about. Nobody in my\nfamily was persecuted.\n“I can remember some of the village meetings at the end of the Cultural\nRevolution, in 1974 and 1975. I didn’t really understand, of course, because I\nwas only in elementary school, but I remember them clearly. They would\ntake a Landlord, or maybe a Capitalist Roader—usually somebody who had\nbeen trying to sell firewood or vegetables—and they would have a meeting to\ncriticize him. He’d stand like this.”\nTeacher Kong demonstrates: feet together, waist bent slightly, head\nbowed so that his chin is tucked against his chest. For a few seconds he\nstands completely still, and then he laughs and continues the story.\n“They didn’t do the airplane so much. Mostly they had to stand like this,\nand if they didn’t bow their head far enough, the people would force them\ndown. I remember one older man in the village who had been a Landlord. At\nall the meetings they made him stand for hours like that, with his head\n\nbowed. He would shift his head to the side, because it was more comfortable\nthat way, and finally after all the meetings his head was like that all the time.\nEven after the Cultural Revolution was finished, he would walk around the\nvillage with his head bent to the side.”\nTeacher Kong is still standing, and now he tilts his head to the left and\nwalks across the room. He laughs again and shakes his head.\n“When you’re a child, all of that seems very exciting. Of course it has\nsome influence on a child—you see something like that when you’re small,\nand it affects your thoughts. At the time we thought it was fun. During a\nmeeting they might criticize the father of a classmate, and then afterward\nwe’d make fun of the child: ‘Your father’s a Counter-Revolutionary!\nCounter-Revolutionary! Counter-Revolutionary!’ It wasn’t something we\nunderstood, but we used to say it.”\nHe imitates a child, pointing and laughing and covering his mouth as he\nsays the words, Fan Geming, Fan Geming, Fan Geming. Counter-\nRevolutionary, Counter-Revolutionary, Counter-Revolutionary. And then\nsuddenly he is serious again.\n“Nowadays people look back at that time and say it was absurd. It’s\nalmost funny, because the things people did were so huangtong, so\nridiculous. But back then, all of that was serious—it was real life. It wasn’t\nfunny. It’s impossible to understand that today.\n“And perhaps in the future it will be the same with what’s happening\nnow. Ever since Deng Xiaoping’s Reform and Opening, everything has been\nmuch better, and we know that those problems of the Cultural Revolution\nwill never happen again. But still it might look different in the future. Today\nwe look back at the Cultural Revolution and say it’s so ridiculous, but\nperhaps in the future people will look back at today, and maybe they’ll say\nthe same thing.”\n\nCHAPTER TEN\n\nChinese New Year\nAT THE END OF THE FALL SEMESTER, our third-year students went\noff to do their practice teaching. In December, Adam and I made a trip south\nto watch a couple of our favorite students teach; they were training at middle\nschools in Wulong, a town up the Wu River near the border with Guizhou\nprovince. It was a very remote area and the schools were honored to receive\nforeign guests; for two days we gave speeches and attended banquets, and we\nplayed in an exhibition basketball game.\nAdam and I had spent so much time together that we could give a good\njoint speech without a bit of planning; we knew how to play off each other\nand everything always went smoothly. We gave the Wulong speeches half in\nEnglish and half in Chinese, and mostly we tried to get the students excited,\nwhich wasn’t difficult. After every speech hundreds of them crowded around,\nasking for autographs, and we signed until finally the cadres dragged us off to\nsome other event. We were scheduled to give speeches and attend meetings\nfor virtually every hour that we were in Wulong.\nAfter two days of that we were completely exhausted. Often my days in\nSichuan ended like that, in absolute and total exhaustion. Part of it was that I\nwas usually sick—I had chronic sinus infections from the pollution, which\nfinally made me stop running, and my health was bad enough that I was\ninfected with tuberculosis during that year. By the time I left Fuling, my\nPeace Corps medical folder would be swollen with the illnesses and injuries\nof those two years: tuberculosis, amebic dysentery, chronic sinusitis, a broken\near drum, a broken nose (from basketball), one eye with dramatically reduced\neyesight (a mystery).\nThe climate wasn’t healthy, but mostly I was run down by the pressures\nof daily life as a waiguoren. It was tiring always to be the center of attention,\nand being a foreigner meant that you were more likely to attract\ncomplications. Often there was some minor crisis or issue that demanded my\n\nattention—a Miss Ou incident, or somebody from the teahouse calling me\nevery day for a week, or something of that sort. I didn’t really mind, because\nthis was the life I had chosen; the teaching itself was rarely stressful, and I\npushed myself in the city simply because I found my Chinese life fascinating.\nTraveling usually added more stress, and there was nothing harder than\nspending time in a tiny river town like Wulong, where the pressures of Fuling\nwere intensified. It was also rewarding, because the people were thrilled to\nsee outsiders, but in the end it was impossible to maintain any control over\nyour life in a place like that. The hardest thing for me to imagine was that\nsomeday foreigners might live in towns like Wulong. It was bound to happen\nas Reform and Opening accelerated, but I couldn’t envision it, because it\nseemed to me that if a waiguoren lived there he wouldn’t last three months.\nThe intentions of the community would be nothing but the best, but they\nwould kill you with kindness—an endless parade of banquets and special\nevents. After two days in Wulong, Adam and I became sick, and it took us\nhalf a week to recover.\nWe had five weeks’ vacation for the Spring Festival, or Chinese New\nYear, starting in mid-January. Sunni went to Thailand; Noreen headed off to\nsouthern China and Vietnam. Adam decided to take the boat to Shanghai and\nthen swing south to visit Anne in Shenzhen. I planned to do some hiking\nalone in the Guizhou mountains, but the more I thought about travel in China\nthe more clearly I remembered the last train ride I had taken in Xinjiang. I\nalso thought about the exhaustion of Wulong, and my comfortable Fuling\nroutines started to look better and better.\nIn six months I would leave the city. As the vacation started, I realized\nthat my time in Fuling was limited, and I knew that there was no other place\nin China where I wanted to spend the Spring Festival. It was the biggest\nChinese holiday, a time for family reunions; Fuling was my home, and so I\nstayed.\nI WOKE UP EARLY IN THE MORNINGS and wrote for three or four\nhours. That was the English part of my day; usually it was over by ten or\neleven in the morning. To clear the language from my head, I studied Chinese\nin my apartment for another hour, reading a newspaper or listening to tapes,\n\nand after that I went to lunch at the Students’ Home. In the afternoons and\nevenings I walked around the city, and often I ate dinner with friends.\nTeacher Liao and her husband had me over a couple of times, as did Teacher\nKong, and there were several people in the city who often invited me to eat.\nIf nobody had me to dinner I ate in town or went back to the Students’ Home,\nwhich was the same as eating with friends.\nEnglish became a language strictly for writing; during that month I spoke\nnothing but Chinese. Later I would look back on that holiday as my favorite\ntime in China, because at last my Chinese life was settled, and I saw precisely\nhow I fit into the local routines. All of it had to do with Ho Wei—not a single\nEnglish department colleague invited me over or had anything to do with me\nduring the vacation. Later that spring, I would discover that this was the\nresult of explicit instructions, because from the moment Adam and I had\narrived in Fuling, the department authorities had told the English faculty not\nto associate closely with the foreign teachers. Like so many of the cadres’\npolicies, it stemmed from a vague and pointless paranoia, and perhaps the\nsaddest part was that it was extremely effective: I was much closer to the\nuneducated family at the local noodle restaurant than I was to the English-\nspeaking teachers in the college. But by isolating me, the department\nauthorities had simply pushed me to become something else, and now even if\nthey changed their minds I would never trade the life I had for English-\nspeaking friendships. During the holiday I was the only waiguoren in the\ncity, but for the first time I no longer thought of myself as being alone.\nGroups of local children often came up to my apartment, because I had\nstrings of holiday lights on my balcony and it was beautiful out there at night,\nhigh above the Wu River. Sometimes there were girls led by Ho Li, an\neleven-year-old who shared my family name and called me gege, older\nbrother. Other times I was visited by packs of wild boys who followed Wang\nXuesong, the nine-year-old across the hall. He lived with his grandparents\nand his mother, who was divorced, and the adults in his apartment had strictly\ntold him never to bother the waiguoren neighbor. But Little Wang and I\nlearned how to trick them; either he’d come with a group of other kids, or he\nwould leave his apartment and walk loudly down the steps before turning\naround, sneaking back, and knocking softly on my door. I enjoyed talking\nwith him; he would tell me about incidents on campus, life at school, and the\nfat kid in his class, who was so thoroughly despised that he had been\n\nnicknamed Chiang Kai-shek. Little Wang liked to watch my television, look\nat my photographs, and shout at people from my balcony; I let him do\nwhatever he wished. I missed my niece and nephew at home in Missouri and\nit was good to have a child around the apartment.\nTogether Little Wang and I strung nearly one hundred holiday lights\nacross my balcony, and now at night you could see them from the Yangtze. It\ntook us two hours to put all of them up, and afterward, as a reward, I let Little\nWang throw all of the burned-out bulbs down to the sidewalk six floors\nbelow, where they popped and shattered nicely. I didn’t feel particularly\nguilty about encouraging his delinquency; whenever the college workmen\ncame to replace a light in my apartment they did exactly the same thing. And\nthey seemed to enjoy it nearly as much as Little Wang, the workmen giggling\nas the glass exploded on the sidewalk.\nDowntown Fuling glowed bright across the river in the evenings. The city\nstreets were strung with red lanterns and strands of electric lights, and all of\nthe trees were decorated. The small park at South Mountain Gate had been\nturned into a riot of color—its coal-stained shrubs and trees were covered\nwith lights, dazzling in the heart of the city. Crowds gathered to look at the\npark and take photographs. As the holiday approached, it seemed that\neverybody in the city came out in the evenings, families and young couples\nand packs of children, all of them strolling aimlessly up and down the streets:\nbuying snacks, gazing at shopfronts, watching the crowds. Soldiers had\nreturned home on leave, and they marched proudly in their uniforms, keeping\nan eye out for xiaojies. Food stands sprouted along the streets and stairways\n—barbecue grills, potato vendors, tofu men, hot pot stands—and it seemed\nthat everybody ate out on the sidewalk. I did, too; I had always liked Fuling\nat night, but now everything had intensified, and I had never seen a place\nwith so much energy. Even the pathetic trees along the main road finally\nseemed alive, glowing with bright white lights. These lights had been wired\ncarelessly and sometimes they exploded and caught fire, the tree shining\nproudly with a sudden burst of flame and smoke. The pedestrians would stop\nto watch, chattering and laughing, and after the flame died—the tree hissing\nsoftly, the smoke drifting upward—they kept walking through the brilliant\ncity.\n\nON THE NIGHT BEFORE THE CHINESE NEW YEAR, the family at\nthe Students’ Home invited me to dinner. It was the most important meal of\nthe year, a traditional time for family reunions—the equivalent of Christmas\ndinner in America. Huang Xiaoqiang closed the restaurant early, and together\nwe walked up to his apartment at the foot of Raise the Flag Mountain.\nHuang Kai was now two years old, and he had reached a stage where he\nwas frightened by waiguoren. From the beginning he had gone through\ncycles; he was a skittish child and sometimes he played with me and other\ntimes he was terrified by the sight of my face. It was a strange, mixed\nreaction—part fear and part fascination. Whenever a waiguoren appeared on\ntelevision, Huang Kai became excited and called out “Ho Wei!” His parents\nsaid that he often talked about me at home, but for some reason that winter he\nhad become terrified of seeing me in person.\nThe child started crying when I arrived at their apartment for the New\nYear’s dinner. “He’s been doing that off and on for an hour,” his mother said.\n“I told him you were coming and he started to cry; I don’t know why.”\n“I’m sorry,” I said. “I wouldn’t have come if I had known he’d be\nunhappy.”\n“No, that doesn’t matter! He’ll be fine—I’ll just take him into another\nroom for a while.”\nI sat on the couch with Huang Xiaoqiang and his father, Huang Neng, and\ntogether we watched television. That seemed to be what most Chinese people\ndid for the Spring Festival—for two days they watched as much television as\npossible. The first year I taught in Fuling, I had given my students a vacation\nassignment to write about what they did on the day of the holiday, because I\nwas interested in learning about Chinese traditions. The second year I did not\nrepeat that assignment. It was depressing to read about a holiday older than\nChristmas whose celebration seemed to have been refined to gazing at\ntelevised floor shows.\nThe Huang men sat smoking. Neat formations of PLA soldiers marched\nacross the television screen. I could hear Huang Kai crying from the back\nroom, but he was starting to calm down. His mother talked to him softly, and\noccasionally I heard my name as she spoke to the child.\n“Your soldiers in America don’t march the same way ours do in China,\ndo they?” asked Huang Xiaoqiang.\n\n“No, they don’t.”\n“When Hong Kong returned,” asked Huang Neng, “were those soldiers\nAmerican?”\nHis son corrected him: “Those were English soldiers!”\n“Well, they marched differently from us Chinese—they marched like\nthis.” Huang Neng stood up and stomped his feet. He was a small man of\nforty-nine years and he had the wiry build of a peasant. He marched across\nthe living-room floor, bringing his knees up high. “Is that how you march in\nAmerica, too?”\n“More or less.”\n“We think it looks strange—it certainly looked funny when Hong Kong\nreturned!”\n“In Western countries we don’t march like you do in China, and we think\nthe way you march looks strange. It reminds us of Xitele and Nacui—Hitler\nand the Nazis.”\n“Oh, I see—you don’t like them because of the war, right?”\n“That’s right. It’s the same as the way you Chinese see the Japanese.”\n“We Chinese don’t like the Japanese at all.”\n“I know.”\n“They killed many Chinese people in Nanjing. And they bombed your\nAmerica, too.”\n“Yes, they did. In Hawaii.”\n“In China we call them ‘small devils,’ or ‘Japanese devils.’ What do you\ncall the Japanese in America?”\n“During the war, people called them Japs.”\nHuang Neng liked the sound of the word and he said it a few times: Jia-\npahs, Jia-pahs, Jia-pahs.\n“Is it an insult?” he asked.\n“Yes. It’s like saying ‘small devil’ here in China.”\n“So you Americans also don’t like the Japanese?”\n“I think that now most people like them, or at least they don’t hate them;\nwe don’t call them Japs anymore. But during the war Americans didn’t like\nthem.”\n“That’s because they bombed your America.”\n“That’s right.”\n“But then you dropped the atomic bomb on Japan.”\n\n“Yes. We did that twice.”\n“America was the first country to have the atomic bomb.”\n“That’s true.”\n“In science your America is number one in the world. That’s why you are\na chaoji guojia—a supercountry!” Huang Neng gave me the thumbs-up and\nreturned to watching television. It had been a satisfactory conversation,\nwhich pleased him; he was the oldest man of the household and it was his\nduty to make me feel at home. On television the soldiers were finished, and\nnow there was a floor show involving colored hoops and xiaojies in tight\ncostumes. Feng Xiaoqin returned with Huang Kai. He looked at me\nuncertainly and started to play with a toy car in the far corner of the room. I\nignored him until he accidentally rolled the car close to me. I picked it up,\nwatching the child shrink in fear. I pushed the toy back to him and he turned\naway, shyly.\nWang Chaosu, Huang Neng’s wife, finished preparing dinner and all of\nus sat down. There were several pork dishes, all very spicy, and tofu and bean\nsprouts, and a fish from the downtown market. We could have eaten for three\ndays and still there would have been food left over. There was rice, too, and\nWang Chaosu spooned some into my bowl.\n“I know you like to eat your rice with your meal!” she shouted. “That’s\ndifferent from us Chinese! We like to eat it afterward!”\nWang Chaosu shouted everything at me, the way many Americans do\nwhen they meet foreigners with bad English. She was my favorite character\nin the whole family, an earthy, illiterate woman who spoke only the dialect,\nand she had a wonderful sense of humor. She loved the way that I always\nreferred to myself as “the foreign devil,” and she also thought it was funny\nthat Adam and I lied constantly about each other and the new volunteers.\nBack in the fall we had told Wang Chaosu that she could charge Sunni and\nNoreen five times the normal price for noodles, and in return for half of that\nwe wouldn’t tell them they were being cheated.\n“That’s not polite,” she said, shocked. “They just arrived and we\nshouldn’t cheat them.”\n“Who cares?” I said. “They’re just foreign devils! And they have so much\nmoney—both of them are very rich.”\n“You’re lying! I know you’re lying! Next time I’ll cheat you!” That was a\nconstant joke between us—every time we came to the restaurant she talked\n\nabout how badly she was going to cheat the foreign devils.\nShe was a very good cook and the Spring Festival meal was excellent.\nPeriodically Wang Chaosu would shout out, “It’s very bad!” and I would\nreassure her that in fact it was perfect, and then she would spoon some more\ninto my bowl. “Man man chi!” she’d shout. “Eat slowly!”\nAfter dinner we returned to the couch and I played with Huang Kai. He\nwas over his fear now and we rolled a car back and forth, the child laughing.\nHis father was watching television while the grandfather sat in a chair nearby,\ncarefully cutting white and red tissue paper into strips to make fenpiao, or\ntomb decorations. The fenpiao were long narrow tubes made of white paper,\nwith a band of red in the middle and thin white strands hanging down from\nthe bottom. Tomorrow for New Year’s Day the family were going to Baitao,\ntheir home village, where they would use the fenpiao to decorate their\nancestors’ tombs.\n“We’ll go to my father’s tomb,” Huang Neng said. “I usually go there at\nleast twice a year. He died after Liberation.”\nIt always seemed to me that this word should stick in the mouths of\npeople like Huang Neng, who had been Liberated from having a father when\nthe Communists shot him. But like everybody else I knew in Fuling, he used\nthe term without a trace of irony. I asked him how old he had been when his\nfather died.\n“I was ten years old.”\n“That’s very young.”\n“At that time I didn’t understand death,” he said. “At ten years you don’t\nunderstand anything.”\nHe was smiling as he worked, cutting the paper. I rolled the car past his\ngrandson, who chased after it, laughing and shrieking.\n“Your Christmas is the same as our Spring Festival, isn’t it?” Huang\nNeng asked.\n“More or less. It’s our most important holiday.”\n“Do you go to your ancestors’ tombs at Christmas?”\n“No, we don’t have that tradition. Most Americans don’t know where\ntheir ancestors’ tombs are. It’s an immigrant country and people often move.\nYou see, my grandparents’ tombs aren’t in my hometown; they’re in\nCalifornia, which is like going from here to Shanghai. I don’t know for\ncertain where my other ancestors are—some are in Italy, others are in\n\nGermany, and a few are in Ireland and England.”\n“So many countries!”\n“Most Americans are like that.”\n“You couldn’t visit tombs in all of those places for Christmas. Imagine\nhow much money it would cost!”\n“Certainly it would cost too much. Europe is very far from my home.”\n“Well,” he said, “tomorrow we just have to go to Baitao. On the bus it’s\nonly four yuan.”\nAll of us sat together, watching television. An electric coil heater kept us\nwarm and the men used it to light their cigarettes. The floor shows were\nbetter than usual. The holiday wasn’t depressing at all now that I was sitting\nwith the family rather than reading about it in my students’ papers. We\nchatted and joked for a while, and suddenly Feng Xiaoqin became serious.\n“When you first came here,” she said, “were you sometimes disgusted by\nthe Chinese people?”\nI was taken aback by the question and I didn’t see where it had come\nfrom. I asked her what she meant.\n“Do you think that some people are very rude, because they laugh at\nyou?”\nAgain I didn’t know how to respond—it was very kind of them to have\nme in their home, and we seemed far away from anything unpleasant.\nEverybody else was intent on the television, and I thought it was better to talk\nabout something else.\n“No,” I said, “I think people are very friendly here.”\n“No, no, no,” she said, impatiently. “Like the time you and Mei Zhiyuan\nwere eating in the restaurant, and that woman was laughing at the two of\nyou.”\nMei Zhiyuan was Adam’s Chinese name. I remembered the incident,\nwhich had been minor—a month before, one of the karaoke xiaojies had been\nlaughing at us, mocking our Chinese and the way we ate. She made a few\nremarks and we told her to shut up and mind her own business. Usually we\ndid nothing about the laughter, but we considered the restaurant to be our\nturf; people had no right to mock us there, especially not karaoke xiaojies.\nI could see that Feng Xiaoqin wanted me to answer honestly. In some\nways I felt that she understood me as well as any of the people in Fuling—\nshe was always at the restaurant, where she had seen me react to many things.\n\nLike everybody, she watched me carefully, but unlike many others she also\nseemed to watch with a sense of empathy.\n“Yes,” I said. “I thought that woman was rude. She was making fun of us\nand that’s why I told her to stop laughing. But it didn’t bother me very much;\nafter that she didn’t say anything else.”\n“She has no culture,” said Feng Xiaoqin. It was a common way of saying\nthat a person was uneducated. Feng Xiaoqin shook her head and continued:\n“That’s why she treated you like that, because she has no culture. Too many\npeople in Fuling are that way.”\n“No, most people aren’t like that. And it’s much better now than it was\nwhen we first arrived.”\n“Still they should not laugh at you. It’s very rude, I think.”\nShe was looking at me steadily, and something in her black eyes made\nme glance away. I gazed at the child, babbling to himself as he played.\n“It’s not important,” I said. “It’s very kind of you to have me for dinner\ntonight—that’s much more important. Huang Kai is a very polite host.”\nShe smiled at the child, and we talked about how much he had grown and\nhow many words he could say. We didn’t mention that earlier in the evening\nhe had been afraid of me, because now the fear was gone and he was\ncomfortable with me in their apartment. And I said nothing about how in the\nchild’s fear I had seen a reflection of all the difficulties that I had ever\nencountered in Fuling, the people’s uncertainty about things new and strange.\nIt was a natural, helpless, human response—an instinct as blameless as a\nchild’s. It took time and effort to deal with that, as well as patience, and now\nI realized how much work had been done on the other side.\nThere was a great deal of generosity in their having me over for dinner.\nThey had known that the child would cry and possibly offend me, but they\nhad invited me anyway. I thought about Christmas dinner in America, and I\nwondered if I would invite a foreigner or a black to eat with my family if I\nknew that my child was afraid of such people. Probably I would—but there\nwould be a point to what I did. I would realize that this was an important\nlesson for my child, as well as an important gesture toward the guest, and this\nwould make me feel good about it. I would do it for myself as well as for the\nothers involved.\nBut tonight there wasn’t any point. Feng Xiaoqin understood me, but not\nto the degree that she knew exactly what I saw in Huang Kai and so many\n\nothers in Fuling. She and her family hadn’t invited me in order to make a\npoint about xenophobia, or anything like that. They knew that I was alone on\nthe holiday, and I was their friend; nothing else mattered. They were simply\nbig-hearted people and that was the best meal I ever had in China.\nFIREWORKS AT MIDNIGHT CALLED IN THE NEW YEAR. I had\nleft the Huang home early, because I was a little tired, and I was getting ready\nfor bed when the sound started, low and steady like thunder rolling over the\nhills. The noise grew louder, echoing across the river valley, and I went out\non my back balcony to watch.\nThe Wu River looked sullen in the night. The city was also dark, but as\nmidnight approached the fireworks increased; I could see them flaring and\nflashing among the streets and stairways. The intensity of the sound doubled,\ntripled; explosions joined in from Raise the Flag Mountain, and in the\ndistance, across the Yangtze, there were flashes on White Flat Mountain. At\nthe stroke of midnight the entire city gathered itself and roared, its voice\nreverberating back and forth across the Wu, the windows of the buildings\nflickering in reflections of sparks and bursts of fire. The old year died; evil\nspirits fled; deep in the valleys heart the Wu trembled, its water colored by\nthe bright shadow of the blazing city. And finally midnight passed, and the\nfireworks faded, and we were left with a new year as empty and mysterious\nas the river that flowed silently through the valley.\nTHE NEXT MORNING I WENT INTO TOWN, where the streets were\nfull of people wearing their new clothes. Traditionally, on New Year’s Day\nyou didn’t wear anything old, and especially the children were dressed\nbrightly. Many of the little girls wore makeup; all of the boys carried guns.\nThat seemed to be another holiday tradition: plastic pellet guns were for sale\neverywhere on special streetside stands, and every male child had a rifle or a\npistol, or both. The guns were accurate and powerful, and in America you\ncould sell perhaps two of them before you were sued. In America there was\nalso a chance that a child would use the guns to shoot at birds, dogs, or cats;\nin Fuling there were very few animals but plenty of people. All around town\n\nboys chased after each other, shouting and firing their weapons.\nAnother New Year’s trend was the appearance of student-beggars. There\nwere always beggars around South Mountain Gate; usually they were\nhandicapped, and sometimes there were minority women with filthy children\nwho pulled at your sleeves. But now every time I went to town I saw two or\nthree students, dressed in their uniforms, hanging their heads in shame before\nmessage boards that featured long stories under the title “Tuition Needed.”\nThe tales were roughly the same—they couldn’t afford their high school or\ncollege fees, often because of a death in the family, and they asked for\ndonations from passersby. Usually the beggars displayed their school\nacceptance letters and student identification cards. None of them came from\nFuling; they were passing through on the Yangtze boats.\nThey made good money—piles of five- and ten-yuan notes. It said a great\ndeal about the Chinese respect for education that you could make money that\nway; I couldn’t imagine getting any response in America to such a scam. At\nleast it seemed to be a scam; over the last couple of weeks I had noticed that\ntwo of the boys were obviously working together, sharing a uniform and\nidentification. They alternated days, and I could always spot the other one\nwatching while his friend begged. My impression was that in the heart of the\nholiday they easily pulled in more than one hundred yuan a day. It was a hell\nof a lot more productive than staying home and watching television.\nI took a bus out to the Buddhist temple above the Yangtze and watched\nthe monk tell fortunes. That was Fuling’s only real temple—people told me\nthat before the Cultural Revolution there had been more than three hundred\ntemples and shrines in the area, but now there were only three, and one with\nmonks. Usually the temple had but a handful of visitors, but today on the first\nday of the New Year there were hundreds of people having their fortunes\ntold. On the street below, vendors sold balloons to children, and other\nchildren shot the balloons with pellet guns. Everywhere I went, children were\ncrying and throwing fits, and everywhere their parents were buying them\nwhatever they wanted. Like other Chinese holidays, the Spring Festival at\nmoments seemed to be a celebration of the social effects of the one-child\npolicy.\nIt was a sunny, cold day, and I walked in the hills above the river, where\na few people were lighting fireworks and decorating the old tombs. On the\npath back down to the street I passed a boy sitting on a rock. He was about\n\nseven years old and he had a rifle in his lap. As I passed I gave him a long\nlook that said: Don’t even think about it. I kept walking down the trail.\nThe pellet hit me square in the back. I had been listening for the click of\nthe barrel, but the gun was already cocked and he caught me by surprise. He\nhad been ready just in case somebody happened to walk past.\nI turned around and walked back slowly. Had he cocked the gun and shot\nme again in the chest, I might have let him keep it, out of a perverse respect\nfor his gall. But he froze, watching me come closer. I had had enough of this\nparticular New Year’s tradition and I grabbed the gun before he could react.\nHe was stunned into silence for a moment and then he started to wail. I\nturned and walked away. At the bottom of the mountain I could still hear him\ncrying, his voice rising above the fireworks that echoed in the distance.\nA few days later some of the neighborhood kids came over and I let them\nuse the rifle to shoot things in my apartment. They compared how much\nmoney each had received for the Spring Festival—that was another tradition,\nas relatives and friends gave children hongbao, “red bags” full of cash.\nLittle Wang had received 1,250 yuan, which was roughly three times the\nper capita monthly income for an urban Chinese household. All of the other\nchildren had cleared between eight hundred and one thousand yuan, except\nfor Fang Siyang, who had made less than seven hundred. She was an\nadorable girl with pigtails, and I could see that she was embarrassed to have\nreceived so little money for the holiday. Once, when I had asked what Fang\nSiyang was like, Little Wang described her social class succinctly. “Her\nfamily,” he said, “owns chickens and roosters.”\nI gave Fang Siyang and the others some American coins and postcards,\nand they left. Little Wang hung behind, playing with the gun.\n“Can I borrow this?” he finally asked.\nThe last time I had seen Little Wang, he had been particularly well\narmed, and I asked him what had happened.\n“I lost all my guns,” he said. “I don’t know where they are.”\nI looked carefully at the boy and saw that he was lying. “Did your family\ntake them away? Tell me the truth.”\nHe stood there staring at his feet, silent.\n“Did you hurt somebody else?”\n“No,” he said. But it wasn’t a very firm reply and he hung his head. He\nfingered the plastic barrel of the gun.\n\n“If I give you this gun,” I said, “will you promise not to shoot anybody?”\n“I promise.”\nI gave him the gun, knowing that I was a hopeless hypocrite. He was a\ncute kid, and when it came to children I was just as weak as Chinese parents.\nAlso, to be honest, I didn’t have much affection for the adults in his\napartment. They seemed pleasant enough, but they never invited me over,\nand whenever they saw me in the stairway they spoke very slowly and\nsimply, as if I were a simpleton or a dog. Their intentions weren’t bad, I\nknew, and in any case it didn’t justify arming their child. But one of my pet\npeeves in Fuling was when locals didn’t treat me as a person. Ho Wei was\nstupid, but he wasn’t that stupid.\nLittle Wang slipped the gun into his coat and I let him out the door. He\ngrinned at me and tiptoed down the stairs. I shut the door, quietly. A few\nseconds later I heard him come charging loudly up the steps, pounding on his\ndoor as if he had just returned from playing outside.\nIN THE FIRST WEEK OF FEBRUARY I went down river to Fengdu,\nwhere I met Teacher Kong and his wife’s family. His own parents had died\nwhen he was a child, so he always spent New Year’s with his in-laws, who\nlived in the city.\nTogether we climbed the stone steps up Double Laurel Mountain to get a\nview of the area, and after a few minutes we passed the 175-meter\nwatermark. We stopped and looked down on the city. It was a gray morning\nand all of Fengdu lay below us, stretched across the northern bank of the\nYangtze. All of it would be flooded by the new reservoir, and I asked\nTeacher Kong where his wife’s family would go after the dam was finished.\n“They’re moving across the river, to the New Immigrant City,” he said.\n“We can go over there after lunch, if you want to see what it’s like.”\n“When will they move?”\n“They don’t know yet. Maybe in two years, or longer. Many of the details\nare still uncertain.”\n“Will they have to pay anything?”\n“The government gives a lot of support, but it’s not free. They’ll have to\npay some money for the apartment, but I don’t think it’s too much. Probably\n\ntwo thousand yuan or more.”\n“Are they opposed to it?”\n“No,” he said. “They want to move. You’ll see their current apartment—\nit’s too small. Their new apartment will be nicer, and anyway Fengdu City is\nso dirty. It’s small and crowded. The new city will have more space, and it\nwon’t have the same problems with traffic that Fengdu has. Very few people\naround here oppose the dam.”\nThis was another benefit of the Three Gorges Project, which was a boon\nto civil engineers and urban planners, who could finally create cities with\nefficient roads and good sewage systems. And I could see why The Xus\ndidn’t mind moving; their apartment was cramped and it was located on a\nfilthy alley. But at the same time I liked Fengdu, although I liked it with a\nforeigners eye—I liked the coal-stained gray of its old-fashioned houses, and\nthe narrow cobbled streets that bustled with traffic. It was an old river town\nand there was a certain charm in its dirtiness and inconvenience.\nXu Lijia was Teacher Kong’s wife, and today was her thirtieth birthday.\nBoth of her sisters had come to their parents’ apartment to celebrate. The\nyoungest sister was in her early twenties and worked in Fengdu, while the\nmiddle sister, whose name was Xu Hua, worked for an insurance company in\nXiamen, one of the booming cities on the east coast of China. Neither of the\nyounger sisters was married.\nXu Hua carried a cell phone and contributed three bottles of French wine\nto the birthday party. We drank a bottle with the dumplings that Mrs. Guo\nhad made, toasting each other. The dumplings were very good. The wine was\nnot so good and Mt. Xu, who was fifty-three years old and worked at the\nlocal electric plant, made a face as he drank. But the wine was imported, and\nXu Hua was proud to have brought it in honor of her sister’s birthday.\nI had always liked Teacher Kong’s wife; she seemed more comfortable\nwith me than most people on campus were, probably because she was an\nindependent photographer and not a formal part of the college danwei. Many\nentrepreneurs were like that—they dealt much better with waiguoren than the\naverage person. The same was true with Xu Hua, the middle sister, who had a\ncertain east-coast sophistication. She told me that I should move to Xiamen,\nwhere there were plenty of waiguoren and the people were not as backward\nas those here in Fengdu and Fuling. There were several McDonald’s\nrestaurants in Xiamen, she said—a sign of development that struck me as\n\nimpressive, since I hadn’t seen a McDonald’s in a year and a half. Xu Hua’s\nhair was cut short, and she wore tight white pants and a bright yellow jacket\nwith padded shoulders. I asked her if she had any interest in living in Sichuan\nagain.\n“Why should I come back?” she said, laughing. “Fengdu, Fuling—\nthey’re too small and remote; the jobs aren’t good. I can return for the Spring\nFestival every year. That’s enough.”\nAs we ate, Mr. Xu told me that he had a younger brother who lived in\nAmerica. This surprised me, especially when he said that his brother had a\ndoctorate from Columbia University and was now teaching at New York\nUniversity. It seemed unbelievable that a boy could come from a place like\nFengdu and have an American academic career, and I asked Mr. Xu if his\nbrother had gone to school here.\n“No, no, no,” he said. “My brother grew up in Taiwan, along with my\nthree sisters. My family was split.”\nHe said no more about this until after lunch, when he went into another\nroom and returned with a stack of letters.\n“These are from my brother in America,” he said. “He usually writes me\ntwice a year.”\nThe stack was tied with string. Mr. Xu undid it carefully, then handed me\nthe letters. All of them had been kept in their original envelopes, although\nmost of the stamps had been steamed off for Mr. Xu’s collection. Slowly I\nleafed through them. Some of the envelopes were from Taiwan and others\nhad been sent from America. Mr. Xu’s brother used the complex Chinese\nscript of Taiwan and Hong Kong, and I would have had trouble reading the\nletters even if I had felt bold enough to take them out of their envelopes. But I\nhad just met Mr. Xu, and so I merely looked at the envelopes and the bare\nplaces where the stamps had been.\nIn some ways it wasn’t necessary to read the letters, just as it wasn’t\nnecessary to know the full details of Mr. Xu’s story. That stack of envelopes\nwas poignant enough—they had been preserved with such reverence that they\nwere heavy with the intimation of a story that I knew could only be sad. And\nmostly it was clear that this brother in Taiwan had had a very different life\nthan had Mr. Xu in Fengdu.\nHe handed me a photograph of a Chinese man in his graduation gown,\nstanding before the red brick buildings of Columbia University. The man in\n\nthe photograph was much younger than Mr. Xu and he was smiling. He had\nhis arm around a pretty Chinese woman. It was a sunny day and the campus\nlooked bright and clean.\n“That’s when he graduated with his doctorate,” Mr. Xu said proudly.\n“And that’s his wife—she’s Chinese, too, but she grew up in America.”\n“Have they ever come here to visit you?”\n“No,” he said. “I have never met my brother.”\nAfter he said that, the envelopes seemed even heavier. I was about to ask\nhow they had been split, but his daughter interrupted and asked how much\nmoney I thought the young man made as a teacher at New York University.\n“I don’t know,” I said. “But that’s a very good university. Probably he\nmakes at least fifty thousand dollars a year.”\n“He has a car, too,” said Mr. Xu.\n“Most people in America do,” I said.\n“How much does a car cost?”\n“It depends. Usually more than ten thousand dollars.”\n“So he must have a lot of extra money from his salary, especially since\nshe works, too. In his letters he doesn’t say very much about money.”\n“Well, I think they probably have expensive rent, you know. The living\nexpenses in America are very high, especially in New York.”\n“His wife’s father bought them a house. So probably they can save a lot\nof money, right?”\nI wasn’t exactly sure what they were getting at, but it seemed they were\njust curious to find out what the man’s life was like in America. They asked\nhow one acquired American citizenship, and they asked what it was like to\nteach in America. We talked a little about politics, and Mr. Xu asked me what\nI thought about the Taiwan issue.\nSitting there with the stack of envelopes, I couldn’t have been thrown a\nmore loaded question. I replied that I had never been to Taiwan and thus I\ndidn’t understand it.\n“What do most Americans think about it?” he pressed.\n“Most Americans also don’t understand the problem very well. I think\nmostly they want things to be peaceful.”\n“They think Taiwan is a separate country from China, don’t they?”\nI was glad to see that at least we had shifted the pronouns—whenever I\nwas on uncertain ground I tried to make it “their America” rather than “my\n\nAmerica.” That was a small but crucial distinction, but still I found it difficult\nto respond to his question.\n“Most Americans think Taiwan is like a separate country,” I said. “It has\nits own government and economy. But Americans know the history and\nculture are the same as the mainland’s. So maybe they think it should return\nto China, but only when the people in Taiwan are ready. Most Americans\nthink this problem is much more complicated than Hong Kong.”\nMy response seemed to satisfy him. I considered asking him about his\nbrother, but I decided that it was safest to talk about it with Teacher Kong\nsome other time. Instead I asked Mr. Xu what Fengdu had been like in the\npast.\n“When Mao Zedong was the leader,” he said, “everything was bad. We\ncouldn’t talk to a waiguoren like you. In those times there wasn’t any\nfreedom and there were no rights at all. But after Deng Xiaoping started the\nReform and Opening, then everything started to improve. Things are better\nnow.”\nIt was similar to what I heard so often from people in Sichuan, although\nMr. Xu’s opinions on Mao were much more blunt. He had a poster of Deng\nXiaoping in his apartment, hanging prominently above his television.\nON THE WAY ACROSS THE YANGTZE, Xu Hua told me that she knew\nhow to drive an automobile. We were riding an old battered ferry to the\nsouthern bank, where they were constructing Fengdu’s New Immigrant City.\nThe conversation had been about some other topic when suddenly Xu Hua\ntold me that she knew how to drive.\nI had lived in Sichuan long enough to be impressed. “Is that for your\njob?”\n“No,” she said. “I studied it in my spare time.”\n“Just for fun?”\n“Yes. It’s my hobby.”\n“That must be very expensive. I know it’s expensive in Fuling.”\n“It’s much more expensive in Xiamen—it costs six thousand for the\ntraining course. But I think that someday I’ll be able to buy a car, so I wanted\nto learn how to drive now. It’s like your America—don’t most people in\n\nAmerica have cars?”\n“Yes. Even students do—I bought one when I was in high school.”\n“You see? Here in our China the living standard is rising so quickly, and\neventually the people will be able to have their own cars just like you do in\nyour America.”\nThe ferry wallowed slowly across the heart of the Yangtze. I had a brief\nbut terrifying vision of Fuling’s traffic in twenty years. Xu Hua kept talking.\n“I want to go to your America,” she said. “New York, especially. Maybe\nsomeday I’ll go there on business for my company.”\nWe were close to the shore now and I could see an enormous sign that\nhad been erected for investors:\nThe Great River Will Be Diverted\nWhat Are You Waiting For?\nThe New City Open District Welcomes You\nThree months earlier, the river had been diverted into a man-made\nchannel beside the construction site of the future dam at Yichang. The\ndiversion was the first tangible sign of progress on the dam, and it had been\ntelevised live all across China. I had watched part of the coverage, which\nturned the newly bent river into a celebration of nationalism: construction\nworkers waved their hard hats and cheered while a military band played “Ode\nto the Motherland.” President Jiang Zemin and other politicians gave\nspeeches about the glories of modernization and the success of Socialism\nwith Chinese Characteristics. It was a foggy day and fireworks echoed\nthrough the misty hills.\nBut here in Fengdu the November celebration seemed far away. We\ndisembarked and headed up the sandy bank, walking beside mustard tuber\nfields and piles of trash. We climbed to a row of peasant homes. The homes\nwere poor and there was a heavy smell of night soil as we passed. The path\nclimbed steeply, winding between more flimsy huts. Xu Hua and the other\nwomen were dressed nicely, in high heels and bright clothes, and they moved\nslowly through the mud. At last we crested the hill, passing through a final\n\ncluster of peasant homes, and spread before us was the entire new city of\nFengdu, sprawling half-constructed in the mist.\nEver since I first arrived in China, this was what I had been expecting to\nfind someday. All of the cities I had seen were to a large extent construction\nprojects—even Yulin, the ancient city in northern Shaanxi province, had its\nshare of scaffolding and building crews. Fuling changed every month: new\nbuildings sprouted like a forest of fresh white tile and blue glass, and then a\nmonth later the buildings aged prematurely as coal stains started creeping\ndown from the roofs. Everywhere in China, people were building; the cities\nwere growing, changing entities, more alive than the countryside; and I\nalways imagined an entire nation rising at once, a China locked by\nscaffolding rather than the Great Wall.\nAnd now in Fengdu that image had finally become reality: an entire city\nwas being constructed literally before my eyes. There were streets, sidewalks,\napartment buildings, businesses—all started; none finished. You could guess\nonly vaguely where the new Fengdu was going, but mostly you could tell that\nit was going very quickly, and nothing would stop it. Indeed, if it was stopped\nat this moment, it would be completely worthless. Here in the forgotten heart\nof China I had found the perfect metaphor of the entire country’s\ndevelopment.\nToday there was little work being done and the construction site was\nquiet. But it wasn’t empty—crowds of people had come across the river from\nFengdu to see their new city. Most of them were well-dressed, the way\nChinese looked when they went to spend a day at the park. The men wore\nneat suits and the high-heeled women stumbled over the rough dirt streets,\ngiggling and splashing mud onto their stockings. They stared at the\nscaffolding and the enormous piles of dirt that bordered the intersections. The\nhalf-built streets bristled with propaganda signs:\nThe Development Relies on the Immigrants, the Immigrants Rely on the\nDevelopment!\nThe People Build the Peoples City, If It Is Built Well, the City Will Serve\n\nthe People!\nWe stopped on what would someday be the main street—Pingdu Road—\nand Xu Hua used her cell phone to call a friend in Xiamen and wish her a\nhappy birthday. Among the new buildings there were still a half-dozen\npeasant homes, small and resolute in the shadow of their towering neighbors.\nChickens wandered down side alleys. Potato fields were squeezed between\nthe construction sites. A few graves still remained, their white tomb\ndecorations hanging limp in the mist, paying homage to the ancestors who lay\nin the earth below this rising city.\nThe majority of the peasant homes had been removed and now the people\nlived in a couple of apartment buildings that had been nearly finished. The\nex-peasants sat at tables in the middle of the construction site, drinking tea\nand playing mah-jongg. I asked Teacher Kong what the peasants would do\nnow, and he said that most of them helped with construction work and waited\nfor the factory jobs that would be given to them once the city was built. In the\nmeantime, like the ex-peasants whom I had seen in the resettlement area\nbehind Fuling Teachers College, they seemed perfectly content to drink tea\nand play mah-jongg while the city rose around them.\nWe took photographs in front of an enormous sign that showed the street\nplan for the new city. The two younger women liked my baseball cap, and\nthey took turns wearing it for the pictures. Xu Lijia spent a roll of film there,\nmostly for photos of her sisters in classic xiaojie poses: shoulders pushed\nback, head angled seductively, a soft smile and flirty eyes. For all of the\npictures they wore my dirty old Princeton cap. In the background was the\nsign and the scaffolding and the piles of dirt. We hiked back down to the\nferry, through the potato fields and the thick river mist, and Teacher Kong\nasked, “So, what do you think of the New Immigrant City?”\nIn truth I had never before seen anything even remotely like it: an entire\nnew city, dozens of dislocated peasants playing mah-jongg, future flood\nrefugees strolling through the construction site as if it were a park. The\nquestion was unanswerable, and so I answered in the same way that I did to\nall questions of that sort.\n“I think it’s very good,” I said.\n\nBACK IN FENGDU we caught a cab on the docks. I was heading to the bus\nstation, and we would drop off the women along the way.\nA Yangtze boat had just docked and there was a long line of cabs waiting\nto go to town. It had started to rain softly, which made the road slippery with\nmud. Cabs were honking madly. People scurried along the street, holding\nnewspapers over their heads.\nThe road climbed steeply to the city, and the last stretch was too slick for\nthe cabs. Four of them tried to accelerate up the rise, but their tires spun\nuselessly. One by one the cars drifted backward. Our driver gunned his\nengine and made it halfway up the hill before sliding back. He tried again.\nAfter our third attempt, the women got out of the cab and walked up the\nhill into town. This time our driver started from farther back, working up a\ngreat deal of speed, but still his tires spun near the top and we didn’t quite\nmake it. The hill was very steep and smooth, and I found myself looking at\nthe situation analytically and thinking of all the simple ways in which it could\nbe improved. This was a very bad habit that nearly all foreigners fell into\nwhen they lived in China, and even after a year and a half I couldn’t quite\nshake it.\nI thought about how it wouldn’t be difficult to regrade the hill, making it\nless steep, or they could wind the road across the slope of the bank. Probably\nthe simplest solution would be to cut lateral grooves into the pavement, so\ntires would have something to grip when it rained. I considered all of these\noptions and was engaged in choosing the best solution when suddenly I\nthought: Screw it. This entire city will be underwater in a few years. Who\ngives a damn? They can build a new road in the new city across the new\nriver.\nOn the fifth try we finally made it. I could smell the tires as the driver\nraced through town. At the station I shook Teacher Kong’s hand, thanking\nhim for his hospitality, and then I caught a bus back to Fuling. The road ran\nlow alongside the river. It rained harder. All of the villages I passed through\nwere waiting patiently for the flood.\nA COUPLE OF WEEKS LATER I had class with Teacher Kong and asked\n\nabout his father-in-law, Mr. Xu. He explained that Mr. Xu’s father had\ngraduated from university in Wuhan, after which the Kuomintang had sent\nhim to do radio work in Chengdu. That was in the 1940s, and eventually he\nwas transferred to Taipei, the capital of Taiwan. His wife and two young\nchildren stayed behind with relatives in Fengdu. The move wasn’t permanent,\nand always Mr. Xu’s father thought he would return to his family in Sichuan.\nBut after 1949, when the Kuomintang fled to Taiwan, the family was\ndivided for good. They couldn’t even exchange letters, and Mr. Xu, who was\na young child in Fengdu, started a long lifetime of helpless bad luck.\n“After Liberation their life was very hard,” Teacher Kong explained. “His\nmother starved to death in the early years, because things were so bad in the\ncountryside. The children barely survived, and once they started school they\nhad many problems with persecution, because their father was in Taiwan.\nDuring the Cultural Revolution they were labeled Pantu, ‘Traitors,’ and\nTewu, ‘Special Agents’—spies, really. At that time there were the Nine Black\nCategories—do you know about those? There were Landlords, Rich Peasants,\nCounter-Revolutionaries, Bad Elements, Rightists, Traitors, Special Agents,\nCapitalist Roaders, and the Old Stinking Ninth, who were intellectuals. You\nand I would be the Old Stinking Ninth—sometimes even now teachers like us\nwill call each other that, as a joke.\n“The two children didn’t suffer much violence, but they were persecuted.\nMostly it meant they didn’t have opportunities. If they wanted to study past\nmiddle school, or get a good job in a factory, they had no chance. And during\nthe political meetings everybody criticized them, even though they had hardly\nknown their father.\n“After Reform and Opening, Mr. Xu started sending letters to Taiwan to\nsee if his father was still alive. Sometime after 1980, he found him—until\nthen he didn’t even know if his father was dead or not. They started\ncorresponding, and in 1988 his father returned to the mainland to visit for the\nfirst time. He had a good job in Taipei with the telegraph company—he was\nbasically the same rank as a high cadre is here on the mainland. He had\nremarried after Taiwan was split, and he had other children, including the son\nwho is now in America.\n“After China-Taiwan relations started to improve, the government began\nto give jobs to people like my wife’s father, because they had been\npersecuted. This was a way to improve relations. So in 1988, Mr. Xu was\n\ngiven a job in the electric plant. But of course by that time he had already had\na very hard life. Even today he doesn’t like to talk about the Cultural\nRevolution.”\nI thought of the old man in Fengdu with his stack of envelopes. So often\nmy experiences in Sichuan were like that—I brushed against people just long\nenough to gain the slightest sense of the dizzying past that had made them\nwhat they were today. It was impossible to grasp all of the varied forces that\nhad affected Mr. Xu’s life and would continue to affect him in the future—\nthe war, the Taiwan split, the Cultural Revolution; the dammed river and the\nnew city; his pretty daughter in Xiamen with her cell phone and driving\nlessons. How could one person experience all of that, helpless from start to\nfinish, and remain sane?\nBut I remembered the poster of Deng Xiaoping above his television, and I\nremembered the way he had grimaced while drinking the bad French wine\nthat his daughter had brought from Xiamen. It was clear that he didn’t like\nthe taste of the wine, but he knew that it was an expensive and prestigious\npart of the celebration, and thus he drank it dutifully until his glass was\nempty. Afterward his daughter refilled the glass. He drank that, too.\nNEAR THE END OF VACATION I was involved in a public argument on\nGaosuntang, the main uptown intersection in Fuling. It happened out of the\nblue, and it was by far the most serious dispute I had ever been involved in.\nOften in the evenings I ate there during the holiday, because I had gotten\nto know a few of the regulars who worked the sidewalk. Zhang Longhua was\nmy main friend; during the day he sold cigarettes and ran a pay phone, and at\nnight he peddled kebabs from a barbecue stand. He was a friendly, even-\ntempered man, and I had noticed that the regulars tended to defer to him.\nOccasionally there were disputes out there at night—sometimes between\ncustomers and salesmen, but more commonly between the vendors, who had\nstaked out certain spheres of influence on the busy sidewalk. At night the\nwalk was crowded and a barbecue man like Mr. Zhang could clear fifty yuan\non a good night. Last year he had sold kebabs down in Shenzhen, but he\nreturned to Fuling because the overhead was lower.\nOnce I saw two barbecue xiaojies engage in a vicious turf fight, the kind",

          "text": "insults. The man was poor, and in my leisure he undoubtedly saw money and\nthe scorn that comes with it. For a year and a half I had been different, and in\nhis small-mindedness I recognized the worst of the hate and fear that I had\ndealt with in Fuling. It was an unfortunate conjunction of sensitivities, but\nnow the trouble had already started and I was unwilling to back down. “Go,\nsmall friend,” I said. “Go find your big friends.”\nThe people laughed, which made him angrier. Mr. Zhang looked worried\nand told the man to leave, but he refused. He stood there ten feet from me,\nstaring furiously.\nI turned back to Mr. Zhang and talked with him as if nothing had\nhappened. A few minutes passed, and the people went back to their routines.\nStill the little man was there, glaring. One of the regular hot pot women\nchatted with me while I held her baby son. The ten-year-old shoeshine girl\ncame over to see the baby, and on the way back to her stand she insulted the\nman.\n“Shenjingbing!” she shouted. “Crazy man! You’re a crazy man! Don’t\ngive trouble to the waiguoren!”\nI looked at the little man and saw that he was growing angrier. Partly it\nwas the girl taunting him, but mostly he was galled by the way that the\npeople were making such a fuss over me—giving me their stools, handing me\ntheir babies. I tried to sympathize with him; he worked his shoeshine stand\nalone, hustling for everything he got, and then the waiguoren with the big\nsalary sat there comfortably, eating barbecue and chatting with the people.\nHe spoke again. Behind his eyes whatever he was thinking had hardened\ninto a little bead of hatred.\n“We Chinese don’t need this kind of waiguoren” he said, loudly. “Why\ndo we let waiguoren like this come to our country?

For a year and a half I had been different, and in\nhis small-mindedness I recognized the worst of the hate and fear that I had\ndealt with in Fuling. It was an unfortunate conjunction of sensitivities, but\nnow the trouble had already started and I was unwilling to back down. “Go,\nsmall friend,” I said. “Go find your big friends.”\nThe people laughed, which made him angrier. Mr. Zhang looked worried\nand told the man to leave, but he refused. He stood there ten feet from me,\nstaring furiously.\nI turned back to Mr. Zhang and talked with him as if nothing had\nhappened. A few minutes passed, and the people went back to their routines.\nStill the little man was there, glaring. One of the regular hot pot women\nchatted with me while I held her baby son. The ten-year-old shoeshine girl\ncame over to see the baby, and on the way back to her stand she insulted the\nman.\n“Shenjingbing!” she shouted. “Crazy man! You’re a crazy man! Don’t\ngive trouble to the waiguoren!”\nI looked at the little man and saw that he was growing angrier. Partly it\nwas the girl taunting him, but mostly he was galled by the way that the\npeople were making such a fuss over me—giving me their stools, handing me\ntheir babies. I tried to sympathize with him; he worked his shoeshine stand\nalone, hustling for everything he got, and then the waiguoren with the big\nsalary sat there comfortably, eating barbecue and chatting with the people.\nHe spoke again. Behind his eyes whatever he was thinking had hardened\ninto a little bead of hatred.\n“We Chinese don’t need this kind of waiguoren” he said, loudly. “Why\ndo we let waiguoren like this come to our country? Look at how rude he is,\ninsulting me like that. We don’t need this kind of waiguoren in our home.”\nI knew then that I was capable of matching almost any hatred that he\ncould find.

Since\ncoming to China, I had seen nobody in my family except for my sister\nAngela, who prodded my father until at last he worked up enough courage to\nmake the trip. My mother decided to stay at home.\nI met my father at the Chongqing airport. We stayed in a Chinese hotel\nnear the docks; I figured there was no reason to go to a waiguoren hotel and\nspend four times as much money. During the night the hotel workers called\ntwice on the phone and burst into the room once; it always had something to\ndo with checking our passports.

            "Spring Again\nMY FATHER VISITED ME at the start of the spring semester. Since\ncoming to China, I had seen nobody in my family except for my sister\nAngela, who prodded my father until at last he worked up enough courage to\nmake the trip. My mother decided to stay at home.\nI met my father at the Chongqing airport. We stayed in a Chinese hotel\nnear the docks; I figured there was no reason to go to a waiguoren hotel and\nspend four times as much money. During the night the hotel workers called\ntwice on the phone and burst into the room once; it always had something to\ndo with checking our passports.

All of\nFuling had blazed past him in a bright blur, two years in ten days, and now he\nwas going home. I envied him that—but at the same time I was thankful that\nhe was right; I could go back to the peasant home anytime I wished.\nSHORTLY AFTER MY FATHER LEFT, Adam’s parents arrived, and he\nlearned from some of my mistakes while repeating others. They stayed in\nChongqing’s Holiday Inn, but they caught the same kind of slow boat and\nhad the same taxi adventures. And at the beginning his parents had the same\nfrazzled look that I had seen in my father.\nAfter a few days, Adam planned an evening lecture for the students. His\nparents, who used to live in the countryside of Wisconsin, would show some\nslides and talk about American farming. Adam went to the waiban office and\ntold Mr. Wang, who was the foreign affairs officer. This was something I\nhadn’t done when my father lectured—my personal policy was to clear"

            "Respect the Rules and All Will Be Glorious;\nBreak the Rules and the Operation of Machinery Can Cause Shame\nThree carts of gravel came hurtling down the hillside, the workers\ngrinning and hooting as they rode atop the piles of white rock. I passed last\nyear’s sign:\nHappy Happy Go to Work, Safe Safe Return Home.\nI decided that that would be my mantra for the day: happy happy, safe\nsafe. I repeated the words to myself as I hiked across the scarred hillside, and\nthen I descended into the deep green valleys whose streams washed westward\ntoward the Wu.\nSpring was everywhere in those valleys—the blooming paulownia trees,\nthe golden fields of rapeseed that shivered in the breeze, the eager plots of\nradish and lettuce and onions and broad beans. The rice seedlings were bright\nand green beneath sheets of plastic stretched taut over bamboo frames.\nI came to the fourth cross valley where a peasant was guiding a plow\nbehind a water buffalo. The man’s trousers were rolled up past his knees as\nhe waded in the muck. The air was sweet with the heavy scent of a nearby\nrapeseed plot. The old man’s wife and grandson were sitting beside the field,\nand I stopped to say hello.\nThe woman looked at me intently. “I saw you last year, didn’t I?” she\nasked.\n“Yes, I came through last year. I live in Fuling.”\nThe man stopped plowing and smiled. “I remember,” he said. “You had a\nmap and you were asking which way to go. But you didn’t understand what\nwe said, and you went the wrong way. We were trying to help!”\nI promised that this year I would get it straight. They asked what I did in\nFuling, and I told them I was a teacher."

The man\nwas fifty-four years old, small and thin and as strong as the ox he followed.\nHe had black hair in a neat crew cut, and I could see that he would look like a\nteacher if he cleaned up.

What was he doing?”\n“I’m not certain. He was studying something here. And he was walking\nvery fast—in the hills he walked even faster than the local people!

I stopped to rest and a group of peasant women gathered around.\nMost of them were in their sixties, dressed in blue, and I told them that this\nwas a beautiful area.\n“This place isn’t any good,” one of them said. “This is a qiong shanqu—a\npoor mountainous region. The economy here is terrible.”\nI always complimented peasants so I could hear them run down the\nplaces where they lived. They never seemed happier than when they stood\nthere in the sunshine, next to the flourishing rapeseed and wheat and young\nrice, and talked about what a miserable home they had.\nA young girl came up to me. “Are you the waiguoren in Fuling who does\nlong runs?”\n“Yes.”\nShe turned to the old women. “They had a long race in Fuling and he was\nthe best.”\n“That’s why he can walk out here,” one of the women said. “He’s very\nhealthy. Look how few clothes he’s wearing!”\n“Look how big his bag is!” said another. “How heavy!”\n“His feet are so big—look at those enormous shoes!”\nThey studied me for a while and I waited for somebody to ask about my\nsalary.

But he had made the mistake of\ncollecting all of these in Fuling, and he was a tortured soul without any of\nGao Ming’s blithe hopefulness. Ma Fulai often came to me for advice, partly\nbecause he assumed that an American would know how to solve such\ncomplications. But I also sensed that he talked with me because he knew that\nas a waiguoren I was outside the loop. A few of my city friends saw me in\nthis light; they knew that I wasn’t connected to the local gossip networks, and\nso they told me their secrets and asked for advice.\nOne night in late April, Ma Fulai came to my apartment and sat smoking\nin my living room. I could see that he was upset, but he wouldn’t say what\nwas wrong. We talked for a while and then I tried being direct.\n“Are you having some problem with your wife?”\nHe nodded and blew out a cloud of smoke. But still he said nothing.\n“Does she have another boyfriend?” I knew this probably wasn’t the\nissue, but it seemed an easy way to open things. He shook his head quickly.\n“That’s not it,” he said. “The problem is just that we don’t get along. We\nhave nothing in common—no hobbies, no interests, nothing. We fight all the\ntime. It’s been like that since we were married.”\n“Why did you marry?”\n“Because of her parents. Her father and mother put pressure on me.”\n“How did they do that?”\n“Maybe you don’t understand. Here in our China it’s not like it is in your\ncountry. Here if you start to have guanxi with somebody, with a girl, then you"

I’m too busy to go with you.”\n“So tonto,” muttered Don Quixote. For a moment he stood there thinking\nabout what to offer the peasant. In the novel, Don Quixote promises that he’ll\ngive Sancho Panza the governorship of an island, and Adam had suggested\nthat the student play could use Hainan, the island province in the south of\nChina. But the students had their own ideas about Sancho Panza’s reward.\n“I must have a servant,” Mo Money said. “If you come with me, I will\npromise you…Taiwan Island! I will make you governor of Taiwan Island!”\nWith that, Sancho Panza grabbed a mop and the two of them rode off\ntogether, cantering in perfect time as the audience laughed. Mo Money and\nRoger were both talented actors, and there was an instant chemistry between\nthem. Roger was the quintessential sidekick, a skinny, wide-eyed boy who\nweighed perhaps ninety pounds and listened intently to the Don’s commands.\nAnd Mo Money seemed to have taken lessons from The Great Dictator,\nshouting instructions and carrying an air of mock seriousness.\nTogether they bumbled through the Sichuan countryside, attacking\nwindmills, fighting tigers, and causing trouble in rural inns. At one point they\nstopped to rest and Don Quixote commanded his servant to compose a song\nto Dulcinea. Sancho Panza took his guitar and sang under the Japanese pinup:\nDulcinea!"

It was like being a\npolitician in a benevolent environment, handling a press conference at which\nthe theme was simply curiosity.\nThere was a certain power to those moments, because it was a remarkable\nthing to hold the attention of forty people who had dropped whatever they\nwere doing simply to see you. This morning the crowd continued to swell"

I liked being\nsurrounded by their silence and concentration, and I liked the way that all of\nthe black-haired heads were bent seriously.

            "That didn’t seem to be the biggest concern—to be honest, I was far more\nworried about Susan jumping off a bridge. But I said nothing about that.\n“This sort of thing happens everywhere,” I said. “In America it’s very\ncommon as well.”\n“What do people do about the problem there?”\n“It’s very difficult, just as it is here, but usually it can be kept private.\nProbably that is the biggest difference.”\n“That’s the way it should be. But here everybody knows—the whole\ncollege has heard about it.”\n“What do most people think?”\n“A few people think it’s funny; others think she’s a bad woman. But most\nof the students in our class are very sorry for Susan, although we can’t help.”\nShe shook her head and gazed out on the rivers. “Mei banfa,” she said.\n“There is nothing that can be done.”\nTHE NEXT DAY I turned twenty-nine years old. Always in the past my\nbirthdays had felt like somebody else’s—it seemed impossible that I had\nreally gained another year. But this time I knew that I was twenty-nine; in\nsome ways I felt much older. It had been a long two years and during that\ntime I hadn’t left western China.\nIn the morning I went with Adam and Mo Money to the bus station,\nbecause Linda had asked us to meet her when she returned. She wore a black\narmband and her eyes were red. After getting off the bus she tried to smile,\none of those brave Chinese smiles that held the emotion at bay, compressed\nand controlled and pushed to the peripheries—a corner of the mouth, a line\nacross the forehead. But today the sadness was too much; her mouth\ntrembled, and she looked away.\nThat evening I graded my literature examinations. I thought about how\npleasant everything had seemed when I monitored the exam, walking through\nthe rows of students with their heads down, working hard. I liked being\nsurrounded by their silence and concentration, and I liked the way that all of\nthe black-haired heads were bent seriously. There was a simplicity to the\nscene, and there was a similar simplicity to the examination, which had\nnothing to do with the complications of life in Fuling, or the political"

        "that started with cursing and graduated to hair-pulling, growing increasingly\nviolent until finally they were screaming and tearing at each other’s clothes\nwhile a crowd gathered. The strange thing was that both of the women\nworked barbecue stands with men whom I assumed were their husbands or\nboyfriends, and yet these men stood by passively during the fight. They\nseemed embarrassed, or stunned; one of them kept his attention on the grill\nand fiddled with the coals as if nothing was happening. The other man simply\nwatched dumbly. At last Mr. Zhang stepped in and stopped the fight, but by\nthen the shirt of one of the women had been badly torn and she stood there in\nher bra, cursing and spitting, until finally somebody led her home. After she\nwas gone her husband stayed behind, quietly working his grill.\nThat sort of fight was unusual; most nights the regulars got along well\nand supported each other if there were difficulties. I liked this aspect of\nGaosuntang—there was a sense of community, with Mr. Zhang at the center,\nand by knowing him I came to meet the other vendors. One of them was a\nten-year-old shoeshine girl who had dropped out of elementary school\nbecause her family couldn’t afford the fees. I never knew how to react to that;\noften I had my shoes shined in town, and sometimes I figured that I might as\nwell give the girl my business. Other nights I decided that it was horrible to\nhave your shoes shined by a ten-year-old elementary school dropout, so I\nwent to somebody else instead. Like many aspects of my life in Fuling, it was\ninconsistent and I never could figure out what was the right thing to do.\nOne night near the end of the holiday I ordered five kebabs from Mr.\nZhang, who invited me to sit on his stool, as he always did. A few of the\nother vendors came over to chat, as well as a number of passersby who\nstopped to stare at the waiguoren.\nAfter a while the attention died down. I finished the kebabs and sat there\nreading the Chongqing Evening Times. I felt somebody come close, and then\nhe leaned forward and shouted “Hahh-lloooo!” in my face. He shouted as\nloudly as he could, and after that he laughed. I didn’t look up—there was no\nreason to acknowledge people like that.\nI felt him move away and I assumed that he had left; usually the people\nwho harassed me were best handled by being ignored. But a moment later he\nreturned, grabbing one of the sausages from Mr. Zhang’s barbecue stand. He\nshoved the sausage past my newspaper and into my face. “Chi! Chi! Chi!” he\nshouted. “Eat! Eat! Eat!”",
        "There were two things in particular that could anger me quickly in Fuling.\nOne was any sort of physical violation—somebody shoving, or grabbing at\nme, or pushing past rudely. The other was when people treated me like an\nanimal, grunting or gesturing bluntly because they assumed that the\nwaiguoren was very slow and couldn’t speak Chinese. The man with the\nsausage had successfully touched both of these sensitivities at once, and my\ncustomary passivity disappeared immediately.\nI stood up quickly and knocked the sausage out of his hand. He was a\nsmall man in his late thirties, and he moved back, surprised. I stepped\nforward. “Why are you bothering me?” I asked. He stuttered, fumbling for\nwords. I took my hand and placed it even with the top of his head, and then I\ndrew it back, level. It came to my chin.\nYou are much smaller than me,” I said. “You should not bother people\nwho are bigger. Next time I’ll fix you.”\nHe took another step backward and I sat down again. The people around\nus had become quiet. For the first time I looked carefully at the man and saw\nthat he was trouble. There was a mean look in his eyes and clearly he was\npoor. He gathered himself to speak.\n“I have friends who are bigger than you,” he said.\n“I’d like to meet them,” I said.\n“They’re just up the street.”\n“Go get your friends,” I said. “I’ll stay here and wait for you. Go—blow\naway.” It was a common insult and a few of the people laughed. The little\nman didn’t move.\nHe said something else, angrily, which I didn’t understand. Mr. Zhang\ncame over, and I asked him if the man was his friend.\n“No,” said Mr. Zhang. “He shines shoes. He has no culture. You do not\nwant to bother with him.”\n“I wonder what kind of little thing he is,” I said. It was another common\ninsult in Sichuan, to ask a person what kind of thing he was. I should not\nhave been baiting him further but for some reason I couldn’t stop. Logically I\nknew that the scene was absurd—as the big man of the dialogue I weighed in\nat all of 135 pounds, and the five-footer was threatening to go get his big\nfriends.\nBut nevertheless there was a serious air to the confrontation, and already I\nwas sensing that to both of us it meant more than a simple exchange of",
        "insults. The man was poor, and in my leisure he undoubtedly saw money and\nthe scorn that comes with it. For a year and a half I had been different, and in\nhis small-mindedness I recognized the worst of the hate and fear that I had\ndealt with in Fuling. It was an unfortunate conjunction of sensitivities, but\nnow the trouble had already started and I was unwilling to back down. “Go,\nsmall friend,” I said. “Go find your big friends.”\nThe people laughed, which made him angrier. Mr. Zhang looked worried\nand told the man to leave, but he refused. He stood there ten feet from me,\nstaring furiously.\nI turned back to Mr. Zhang and talked with him as if nothing had\nhappened. A few minutes passed, and the people went back to their routines.\nStill the little man was there, glaring. One of the regular hot pot women\nchatted with me while I held her baby son. The ten-year-old shoeshine girl\ncame over to see the baby, and on the way back to her stand she insulted the\nman.\n“Shenjingbing!” she shouted. “Crazy man! You’re a crazy man! Don’t\ngive trouble to the waiguoren!”\nI looked at the little man and saw that he was growing angrier. Partly it\nwas the girl taunting him, but mostly he was galled by the way that the\npeople were making such a fuss over me—giving me their stools, handing me\ntheir babies. I tried to sympathize with him; he worked his shoeshine stand\nalone, hustling for everything he got, and then the waiguoren with the big\nsalary sat there comfortably, eating barbecue and chatting with the people.\nHe spoke again. Behind his eyes whatever he was thinking had hardened\ninto a little bead of hatred.\n“We Chinese don’t need this kind of waiguoren” he said, loudly. “Why\ndo we let waiguoren like this come to our country? Look at how rude he is,\ninsulting me like that. We don’t need this kind of waiguoren in our home.”\nI knew then that I was capable of matching almost any hatred that he\ncould find. I would not start a fight, but if he struck me I would retaliate. The\nperson that he had angered was somebody I myself didn’t really know,\nbecause that person had never existed at home. Part of what Sichuan had\nchanged about me was that in many ways I was more patient and tolerant\nthan before, but there was also another part that had neither tolerance nor\npatience for more abuse of this sort. I spoke to the crowd.\n“You Chinese don’t need that kind of Chinese,” I said. “This kind of",
        "person gives you a bad reputation. When I go home I’ll tell people that nearly\nall Chinese are very friendly, like all of you here, but I’ll say that sometimes\nthere is a man like this who hates waiguoren. He’s the one who is rude, and\nhe bothered me for no reason at all. He started the trouble.”\nEverything had gone quiet except for my voice; the silence made me\nshiver. I was angry but I held the emotion down so I could speak clearly.\n“You came and bothered me, small friend,” I said. “I told you to stop. Now if\nyou want a problem, I’ll give you a problem. Come on, small friend. Come\nhere.”\nThe man took a step forward and Mr. Zhang moved between us. The hot\npot woman was yelling at him: “That waiguoren is a teacher! He has culture\n—you shouldn’t treat him like that.” It was clear that nobody was backing the\nlittle man, and without help he wasn’t going to start anything. His big friends\nhad not materialized. He sat back down at his shoeshine stand, glaring at me\nfrom a distance.\nI wanted to leave but I knew that I should wait until it was obvious that I\nwasn’t frightened. I talked with the people and read my paper. Tension was\nstill in the air, and I could see that everybody was waiting to see if the little\nman would make a move.\nI was ashamed of what I had done. I was glad that the people on\nGaosuntang liked me enough to come to my defense, but I knew that I had\nbeen needlessly cruel and petty. The incident left me embarrassed; I had been\neducated at Princeton and Oxford, and yet for some reason I felt the need to\nface off with a Sichuanese shoeshine man until the locals said he had no\nculture. I knew that his harassment had nothing to do with me personally, and\nI knew that I should have sympathy for him, because his bitterness was the\nresult of other pressures.\nBut after a year and a half in Fuling I couldn’t push away the wave of\nhatred that I felt. I could remind myself who I was, and I could think about\nthe advantages that I had received my whole life; but out on the street all of\nthat slipped away. The strangeness and the pressures of life in a place like\nthat were bound to change you, and something inside of me had stiffened\nlong ago. Indeed, I wasn’t certain that the man was entirely wrong: perhaps\nthe people in Fuling didn’t need this kind of waiguoren. But to some extent\nthey had helped create him, and for better or worse we were stuck together.\nI wondered what the little man was thinking. He sat at his stand, staring at",
        "me. Nobody stopped to have his shoes shined. After a while it started to rain.\n“I have to go now,” I said to Mr. Zhang.\n“You should watch your money,” he said, nodding toward the little man.\n“That’s not a problem,” I said. I thanked him and left. Deliberately I\npassed in front of the little man’s stand. He did nothing. Without looking\nback I walked away.",
        "THE LAND\nApril 15\nTHERE IS A NEW METHOD OF TRANSPLANTING RICE, and about\nhalf of the peasants on Raise the Flag Mountain are using it. In the past,\nseedlings have always been transplanted by hand, row by row, but now many\npeasants are trying paoyang—literally, “throwing the seedlings.”\nThe seeds are first planted in plastic trays, each of which holds five\nhundred plants in individual pockets. When they are ready to be transplanted,\nthe seedlings have a round clump of earth formed around the root; when\nthrown, the weight of this earth carries the seedling and sinks it into the\nmuck. Paoyang saves time—the peasants can throw the shoots from the edge\nof the paddy rather than transplanting each one by hand.\nHalfway up the mountain is a man who has been using this method for\ntwo years. Yesterday he threw his seedlings; today he wades in the paddy,\nstraightening any plants that have slipped out of the mud. He is thirty-five\nyears old, with a black mustache and hard muddy calves. He wears a fake\nbeeper on the belt of his blue trousers. He has one and a half mu of land, or\nroughly a quarter of an acre, which is more land than the average peasant\nworks in these hills.\nNumbers are important here, as they are for farmers anywhere in the\nworld. This particular paddy, one of four that compose his land, is two\nhundred square meters. The peasant estimates that this paddy will use twelve\npans of rice seedlings, which is a total of six thousand plants. These stalks\nwill produce approximately 330 pounds of rice, which will sell for three\nhundred yuan.\nOn the threshing platform of a nearby house a small girl sits at a desk,\ndoing her homework. Beyond the girl is the backdrop of the city with the",
        "setting sun falling orange behind the gray buildings. Next to the house, two\nyoung men throw seedlings into a newly plowed paddy. They are laughing\nand tossing the rice carelessly in every possible direction. They complain\nabout life in the countryside, although they say that at least in the city they\ncan find construction work, which is better than becoming shoeshine men or\nstick-stick soldiers. “The peasants from the very remote countryside do those\njobs,” says one of the men. “Those of us who live here in the suburbs won’t\ndo that kind of work.”\nHe is asked to compare his life to that of a factory worker, and he thinks\nit over.\n“Peasants, workers,” he says. “It doesn’t matter. They’re all bad jobs.”\nApril 28\nTHE SUN IS UNBEARABLY HOT. It has rained once in the last two\nweeks; a drought is building. The corn plants are now about two feet tall. The\nearth around the stalks is dry and powdery, scorched by the sun.\nIn other parts of the world this strange weather is blamed on El Niño. But\nthe peasants, who never speak of El Niño, have their own reasons for the\nheat. The traditional Chinese lunar calendar follows a system in which a\nmonth must be made up every fourth year—sometimes there is an extra ninth\nmonth, or an extra second month, and so on. This year the extra month is the\nfifth one. Whenever there are two fifth months in one year, you can count on\na hot dry spring followed by an extremely wet summer. This is the way it has\nalways been in the past, and thus the peasants are not surprised by the current\nheat and dryness. Everywhere in the countryside they complain quietly about\nthe problems of having two fifth months in one year.\nMay 5\nMOST OF THE WHEAT IS GONE. Over the weekend it rained, and after\nit dried the peasants harvested almost all of the crop on Raise the Flag\nMountain. It was harvested by hand, with short scythes. The wheat stalks\nwere cut close to the ground, leaving rows of stubble, which will be plowed\ninto the earth when the time comes to sow another crop.",
        "The loss of the wheat has subtly changed the mountain’s texture. Last\nweek the crop stood soft and yellow along the terraces, but now those fields\nare bare. The cornfields are beginning to fill out, and the transplanted rice has\nstarted to thicken in the muck of the paddies. Soon the lower mountain will\nbe covered by lush carpets of green.\nPeasants are using sticks to beat piles of wheat on the threshing\nplatforms. The sound of their work—a steady swish swish swish—echoes\nthroughout the countryside. There is also the sound of frogs croaking in the\npaddies, and ducks calling out in the small ponds, and the soft rustling of the\nbreeze in the growing corn.\nAlong the southern shoulder of the mountain a long thin field is being\nharvested; workers are piling the wheat stalks into bundles and tying them\nwith reeds. The bundles weigh more than fifty pounds each, and they must be\ncarried to shelters where they will be kept dry. A young man takes a long\nsturdy stick and stabs it into the heart of a bundle, lifting it onto his shoulder.\nHe uses its weight to help him stick the other end deep into another bundle,\nand then he lifts both bales, adjusts the load, and carries them balanced across\nhis back. He walks quickly, moving with a loose-kneed bouncing gait,\nheading toward home.\nMay 11\nAFTER SIX DAYS the harvested wheat field is unrecognizable. It has been\nflooded and half filled with rice shoots, their green tips poking above the\nwater like drowning blades of grass. In less than a week, the wheat field has\nbeen turned into a rice paddy.\nA man wades in the paddy, transplanting the stalks by hand. His sleeves\nand trousers are rolled up. He bends low and moves backward as he works.\nThe rice shoots stretch in neat rows across the water. This peasant does not\nbelieve in paoyang, and so he transplants his rice completely by hand.\nRice is being tended all over the mountain, in all its early stages. Most of\nthe crop has already been transplanted, but the post-wheat paddies are\nrunning later; farther down the slopes a few peasants are still plowing the\nmuck. On the steeper parts of the mountain, where it’s impossible to grow\nrice, the peasants have not quite finished harvesting the wheat.",
        "Simultaneously they are weeding the corn, which will be ready in a little\nmore than a month. The corn stalks are still headless but now they are nearly\nchest-high.\nToday is cool and overcast, the late-afternoon sun breaking through the\nclouds. Westward the Yangtze runs silver between the hills. The level of the\nriver is still low, because the last month has been dry, but spring is always\nlike that in a year with two fifth months. Even as they transplant the rice, and\nharvest the wheat, and weed their corn, the peasants are waiting for the heavy\nsummer rains that they know will eventually arrive.\nJune 10\nRAIN IS COMING. The air hangs still and thick above the river valleys.\nClouds have gathered and faint rumblings echo from beyond White Flat\nMountain.\nTonight it won’t rain much, but at the end of the month it will pour for a\nweek, and then the rains will continue hard throughout July. In August the\ndownpour will not stop. The rivers will swell and rage. In the east, where the\nYangtze leaves the Gorges and enters the flats of central China, the country\nwill suffer its worst floods in decades. Over 64 million acres of farmland will\nbe inundated, and the death count will reach 3,656. All of this will happen\nbecause of the two fifth months, and the peasants on Raise the Flag Mountain\nwill not be surprised to see such a bad summer.\nBut now—in these humid fields, with those clouds dark overhead—now\nit is still spring. The texture of the growing mountain has shifted once more;\nthe corn stands six feet tall and it is at the point where it has just begun to\nripen. The stalks are still a fresh spring green but the tassels are turning pink,\na soft feathery color that sits lightly atop the deep green of the close-planted\nplots.\nThe rice is thigh-high and long-leafed like swamp grass. The water in the\npaddies has dropped to about an inch and now it cannot be seen through the\nlush green. From a distance the rice fields look smooth, like a lawn freshly\ncut.\nAll seasons are beautiful in the countryside of Raise the Flag Mountain,\nbut the long Sichuan spring is the most beautiful of all. And this particular",
        "moment—today’s ripening corn and growing rice—this may very well be the\nmost beautiful day of the most beautiful season. Next month the corn will be\nharvested, and after that the rice will turn a drab pale yellow; but today any\nchange seems far away. Everything is perfect: the mountain’s texture is\nbalanced like sections of a good painting—the long, even brush strokes of the\nrice plots; the choppy mixed colors of the corn. Standing here in the\ncountryside it is easy to forget that everything is growing, shifting, changing;\nand it is easy to forget that this moment won’t last. It’s like waiting for rain\nwithout worrying.",

        "Spring Again\nMY FATHER VISITED ME at the start of the spring semester. Since\ncoming to China, I had seen nobody in my family except for my sister\nAngela, who prodded my father until at last he worked up enough courage to\nmake the trip. My mother decided to stay at home.\nI met my father at the Chongqing airport. We stayed in a Chinese hotel\nnear the docks; I figured there was no reason to go to a waiguoren hotel and\nspend four times as much money. During the night the hotel workers called\ntwice on the phone and burst into the room once; it always had something to\ndo with checking our passports. Each interruption terrified my father, who\nwas already badly jet-lagged, and I tried to explain that the workers were\nprobably just curious.\nIn the morning we caught the nine-o’clock slow boat downriver to\nFuling. This, like the hotel, proved to be a serious miscalculation on my part;\nwe could have taken a hydrofoil and cut the travel time in half. I thought that\nmy father would like to get a taste of typical river life, but five and a half\nhours is a lot to taste, and the nine-o’clock slow boat was always full of\nSichuanese unemployed who were heading down to Wuhan to look for work.\nThey sprawled like casualties in the hallways, sleeping, smoking, spitting. It\nwas too crowded to wander around the boat, and the mist was so thick that\nyou couldn’t watch the scenery. My father shivered in his bunk until at last\nwe reached Fuling.\nOn the docks I dickered with the cabbies until I found one who would\ntake us to the college for fifteen yuan. The taxi billowed with Magnificent\nSound smoke, and, as usual, the cabby was inspired by the unexpected\nresponsibility of carrying waiguoren. He flew through the center of town.\nPedestrians scurried in our wake. We swung hard onto the Wu River Great\nBridge and the deep green water flowed far below us. My father clung to the\npassenger grip. The guardrails of the bridge flashed past. The engine roared.",
        "“Why,” my father asked, “does he keep honking?”\nFOR TWO DAYS IN FULING my father couldn’t sleep. The noise, the\ndirt, the language, the endless swarms of people, the constant bustle of life on\nthe streets—all of that was too much. At night he lay awake in bed, listening\nto the horns out on the river. It had taken me half a year to come to grips with\nthe city, and now he was trying to deal with it in ten days.\nHe had always found comfort in hard exercise—at fifty-six years of age\nhe still ran ten miles a day—and I decided that this was the best solution to\nhis insomnia. After all, the simple activity of running had been soothing to\nme when I first arrived in Fuling. So for two days I led him on long runs past\nthe summit of Raise the Flag Mountain, into the rugged hills of the high\ncountryside, where the peasants stopped to stare as we charged past. We went\ntwelve miles a day; I made sure the pace was fast.\nIt worked—two days of that and he slept perfectly. But now his nose ran\nlike a faucet and his throat burned; he hacked up coal dust into my sink. He\nwas sick for the rest of his time in Fuling. My sinuses flared up and I was\nsick, too. My father suggested that we skip the running.\nTHAT WAS PERHAPS the longest week and a half I spent in China. It was\nlike seeing a reflection of my entire first year, cut and spliced and crammed\ninto ten days—all of the fear, the annoyances, the fascination, the wonder of\nthe city; everything hit my father in the space of little more than a week. And\nI found that it was difficult to predict what would bother him, because I had\nbeen in Fuling for so long that I no longer saw it with a true outsider’s eye. A\nslow boat that might seem perfectly fine to me was terrifying to him, while\nother things that I had worried about, like the spiciness of the food, didn’t\npose the slightest problem. Like many Peace Corps volunteers all over the\nworld, I found that the parent visit was a kind of revelation: suddenly I saw\nhow much I had learned and how much I had forgotten.\nBy the third day he was more accustomed to the noise and the air, and\nafter that we spent hours walking through the city. We watched the streetside\ndoctor perform surgery on a peasant’s foot; we watched the blacksmiths",
        "pound out chisels on their anvils; we watched the stick-stick soldiers as they\nwatched us. We watched the man at the Lanzhou pulled noodle shop make\nnoodles by hand. We wandered through the markets and watched the workers\ngut eels that had been harvested from the peasant ponds. One morning we\nstumbled onto a small shop in the old town where a man was scrubbing\nsyringes with a dirty brush, and we watched that too.\n“They’re for the hospital,” the man said brightly, when I asked why he\nwas doing that.\n“The main hospital?”\n“Yes, the big hospital!”\nThat was where I’d go if there was a medical emergency. “They use these\nneedles again?” I asked.\n“Of course!”\nI translated everything for my father. I told him what the propaganda\nsigns said, and I introduced him to the regulars all over town. He met Huang\nXiaoqiang and the folks at the Students’ Home; he met the workers at the\npark; he met the barbecue vendors and the ten-year-old shoeshine girl. I\nintroduced him to my friends at the teahouse, and as we left three xiaojies\ncame out of the beauty parlor across the street and started shouting at me:\n“Ho Wei! Ho Wei! Ho Wei!”\n“What does that mean?” my father asked.\n“That’s my Chinese name.”\nThe xiaojies were giggling and yelling my name across the street. They\nwore lots of makeup and their hair was dyed. One was smoking a cigarette.\n“Why are you shouting?” I asked, in Chinese.\n“We’re calling you,” one of them said.\n“Why?”\n“We want you to come here.”\n“How do you know my name?”\n“From Li Jiali—she’s our friend.” All of them giggled after the xiaojie\nsaid that.\n“I have to go now,” I said.\nThey laughed as we walked down the street. My father glanced back and\nasked, “Who are those people?”\nI figured it was a good idea to balance that out with a visit to the church.\nWe met Father Li and chatted in his sitting room. Politely he spoke to my",
        "father, with me serving as the translator, and I mentioned that the priest still\nused Latin during weekday Masses.\n“Tell him that I used to be an altar boy for Latin Mass,” my father said.\nFather Li nodded and said that nobody else in Fuling still understood the\nlanguage. I asked my father if he still remembered the traditional service, and\nhe nodded.\n“In nomine Patris,” he said, “et Filii, et Spiritus Sancti. Amen.”\n“Introibo ad altare Dei,” responded the priest. “I will go in to the altar of\nGod.”\n“Ad Deum qui laetificat juventutem meam,” my father said. “To God,\nWho giveth joy to my youth.”\nFor a few minutes they went through the beginning of the service. I had\nbeen translating for nearly a week, and now it was strange to sit silent,\nlistening and not understanding a word between these two men that I knew so\nwell. The priest’s Latin was tinged with Sichuanese; my father spoke with an\nAmerican accent. Theirs was a rote, formal dialogue in a rusty old language,\nbut it was clear that something about the conversation changed the way the\ntwo men saw each other. After they were finished, Father Li kept forgetting\nhimself, addressing my father directly in Sichuanese, as if he would\nunderstand. But as we left he used Latin once more. “Dominus vobiscum,” he\nsaid. “The Lord be with you.”\n“Et cum spiritu tuo,” my father said.\nWe went camping in the high peaks south of Fuling, where Gold Buddha\nMountain rose to an altitude of more than seven thousand feet. Adam and I\nhad been there before and it was a beautiful area, completely undeveloped\nexcept for old military factories and bases that had been placed there during\nthe height of the Third Line Project, when Mao had restructured China’s\ndefense industry to protect against the American nuclear threat. Since Deng\nXiaoping began dismantling the project in 1980, the bigger factories in places\nlike Fuling had been converted to civilian use, but many of the smaller ones\nin remote areas were simply abandoned. The transportation was too bad to\njustify conversion, and in any case many of the remote plants had been badly\nbuilt. Even in the boom years of the project, some of the factories had been\nconstructed so quickly and haphazardly that they lasted only a few years\nbefore they had to be built again.\nOn the way to Gold Buddha Mountain, my father and I hiked through a",
        "high valley that was full of empty warehouses and factories, crumbling and\ndecrepit, their walls covered with fading propaganda from twenty years ago:\nPrepare for War! Prepare for Famine! Serve the People!\nThe broken walls proclaimed their urgency throughout the silent valley.\nBut there was nobody here to read them anymore; the workers had been\nmoved back to Chongqing, or Fuling, or wherever they had originally come\nfrom. It was just my father and me, hiking alone through the ruins of a valley\nthat had been settled hastily in response to the American atomic bomb.\nFor two nights we camped, hiking up to a cave that led deep into the\nlimestone face of the mountain. The cave mouth was natural, but it had been\nexpanded for some unknown military use—perhaps it had been a munitions\nfactory, or maybe a stockpile—and now there was a long tunnel that led clear\nthrough the heart of Gold Buddha Mountain. We made our way through with\nflashlights, hiking for more than a quarter mile in darkness and finally\ncoming out on the other side, where the northern valley descended to rice\nterraces and the road back to Fuling.\nWe returned to campus and discovered that an English department\nstudent named Belinda had died while we were camping. On Friday\nafternoon she got a headache; on Friday evening she was taken to the\nhospital; by Saturday she was dead. None of the doctors knew why it had\nhappened. She was the second English department student to die in the past\nyear. In addition, one of Dean Fu’s sisters had recently died suddenly, and\nParty Secretary Zhang’s daughter, who was an adorable elementary-school\nstudent, had died during class in the fall. In some ways that child’s death had\nbeen anticipated, if not expected—she had had brain surgery the year before,\nafter which her name was changed. Because of the medical problem, Party\nSecretary Zhang’s wife was given permission to have a second baby. The\nname-changing was a Chinese custom—a changed name in hopes of a change\nof health.\nPeople died in Fuling. It happened everywhere, of course, but it seemed\nto happen with particular frequency and suddenness in the river town. And",
        "often it happened in strange ways; later that year a woman would be killed at\nthe Catholic church when part of the rectory’s roof suddenly caved in. The\nyear after I left, in what was without question the most pointless and pathetic\nof all the Fuling deaths, another English department student died after\nslipping in the squat toilet and striking his head. Small accidents sometimes\nhad disastrous results in a place like Fuling, where the medical care was\nuneven, and the deaths didn’t shock my students as much as I would have\nexpected. They mourned, and then they moved on.\nAnd my father witnessed that as well; along with the rest of us, he helped\nconsole the students as they dealt with the loss of Belinda. But their grief was\nquiet and resolute, as it always seemed to be; and I felt overwhelmed by the\npoignancy of that combination of helplessness and strength.\nAND THEN THE WHIRLWIND of those ten days was over. On my\nfather’s final afternoon in Fuling, we hiked halfway up Raise the Flag\nMountain. It was a warm day; the sun glowed bright above the city. In the\nhills there was a soft breeze. A farmer was preparing his rice paddies, and he\ninvited us into his home to rest. We sat on rough stools in the inner courtyard.\nNobody was shouting; there weren’t any cars or crowds; no propaganda was\nin sight. We simply sat there, breathing the clean fresh air of the countryside.\nThe farmer’s mother came out to speak with us. The old woman was\neighty-one years old, and she laughed when I asked if she had grown up in\nthe house. “This used to be the landlord’s home!” she said. “I was too poor to\nlive in a place like this.”\nIt was a huge, sprawling complex, and the woman told me that it had\nbeen built 150 years ago. Several families lived there now. The roof was tiled\nand there were old-fashioned carved figures along the eaves. There were very\nfew buildings like that in the Fuling countryside, and I asked what had\nhappened to the landlord and his family.\n“They were kicked out in the 1950s, after Liberation,” the women said.\n“They were sent north, to the countryside past White Flat Mountain. I don’t\nknow what happened to them.”\nHer daughter-in-law was listening and she turned to me. “Do you have\nlandlords in your country?”",
        "“No,” I said.\nI was translating everything for my father and he disagreed with that. “Of\ncourse we have landlords in America,” he said. I thought it over and realized\nthat he was right. After two years it almost seemed exotic, a country whose\nlandlords hadn’t been killed or exiled.\n“I made a mistake,” I said to the woman. “We do have landlords in my\ncountry.”\n“That’s what I’ve heard,” she said. “But all of our landlords in China are\ngone.”\nFor nearly an hour we sat there in the former landlord’s house, chatting\nwith the people. Somebody led a water buffalo through the courtyard. The\nchildren returned from school. There was a teenage girl whom my father\nthought looked like my sister Angela—something in the way she carried\nherself. The sun dropped orange behind the city. We thanked the family and\nleft, walking back through the fields.\n“I never would have imagined that I could do that,” my father said. “Just\ngo into a Chinese peasant’s home and talk with them like that. If I were you,\nI’d go up to that place every week.”\nI looked at my father; he was smiling and walking easily through the\nfields. For the first time I realized that he wasn’t nearly as tired as me. All of\nFuling had blazed past him in a bright blur, two years in ten days, and now he\nwas going home. I envied him that—but at the same time I was thankful that\nhe was right; I could go back to the peasant home anytime I wished.\nSHORTLY AFTER MY FATHER LEFT, Adam’s parents arrived, and he\nlearned from some of my mistakes while repeating others. They stayed in\nChongqing’s Holiday Inn, but they caught the same kind of slow boat and\nhad the same taxi adventures. And at the beginning his parents had the same\nfrazzled look that I had seen in my father.\nAfter a few days, Adam planned an evening lecture for the students. His\nparents, who used to live in the countryside of Wisconsin, would show some\nslides and talk about American farming. Adam went to the waiban office and\ntold Mr. Wang, who was the foreign affairs officer. This was something I\nhadn’t done when my father lectured—my personal policy was to clear",
        "nothing with the waiban, because that only left you open to unpredictable\ncomplications. But Adam thought Mr. Wang might want to hear the lecture,\nand so he told him. Mr. Wang said that unfortunately the students would be\nbusy on Wednesday night.\n“They have class?” Adam asked.\n“They already have something planned. I’m sorry.”\n“That’s no problem,” Adam said. “We can do it on Thursday.”\nMr. Wang laughed lightly. He always laughed lightly at everything. It\nwas the sort of laugh that made you distrust Mr. Wang until you got to know\nhim better, and then you trusted him even less.\n“I’m afraid that won’t be possible,” he said. “The students will be busy\non Thursday, too.”\n“In the evening?”\n“Yes.”\n“Well, I’ll talk with them and find a time that works, and I’ll tell you. I\nthought you might want to hear the lecture, too.”\n“Actually,” said Mr. Wang brightly, “it won’t be possible for your\nparents to talk with the students.”\n“Why not?”\n“People in the college have decided that it is not appropriate.” He laughed\nagain.\n“How can it not be appropriate? They’re studying English, aren’t they?\nThis is a good opportunity for them to practice, and it’s only about farming—\nthere’s nothing political. They’re just going to talk about the countryside\nwhere we used to live.”\n“Yes, but you must teach your own courses.”\n“My parents have taught for many years at an American college. They are\nbetter teachers than me, but if that’s the problem, we can have an extra class.\nI just think it’s a good chance for the students to listen to different English\nspeakers.”\n“Believe me, I understand,” said Mr. Wang, “I would very much like to\nhear their lecture, but Mr. Tan is opposed. I’m sorry about that.”\nThis was one of Mr. Wang’s favorite routines—Good Cadre/Bad Cadre.\nMr. Tan was an upper-level administrator who was in charge of the waiban,\nand usually he was Mr. Wang’s Bad Cadre. In fact, we thought that Mr. Tan\nwas the most likable administrator in the college, a friendly man who was far",
        "more honest with us. Things would have been simpler if we had been allowed\nto deal with him directly, but it was more useful to keep Mr. Tan at a safe\ndistance, where he could be the Bad Cadre.\n“How about this?” Adam said. “I’ll teach the class, and then afterward\nthe students can ask my parents questions. Is that okay?”\n“I’m afraid not.”\n“So my parents can’t talk with the, students?”\n“Oh, certainly they can talk with the students!”\n“But if I have class they can’t say anything?”\n“That’s correct.”\nThe next day Adam called role and canceled class. The students were free\nto leave, he said, but if they wanted to stay and listen to Mr. and Mrs. Meier,\nthey were welcome to do so. Nobody left. His parents showed slides and\nlectured on American agriculture. The students asked questions. The\nquestions were answered. No cadres were there, but undoubtedly they heard\nabout it later.\nBy that semester we were growing less tolerant of the mindless political\nrestrictions. Generally I avoided the cadres, which fortunately wasn’t hard to\ndo. I never went to the waiban unless it was absolutely necessary, and I tried\nnot to talk with any of the administrators. In my apartment I had two\ntelephones: one for outside calls and a campus line. It worked nicely because\nonly the cadres used the campus line, which I never answered.\nMr. Wang was the only one whom I really disliked—time and time again\nhe had proven to be particularly oily and dishonest. I didn’t feel the same way\nabout any of the others, but something about them depressed me. Dean Fu\nwas perhaps the saddest case, because I knew that he genuinely liked us and\ncared about our welfare, and yet he seemed to be under immense pressure\nfrom above, and a few times this had prevented him from being open with us.\nInvariably it was like that—there was always some pressure coming from\nabove, the Bad Cadres pushing the Good Cadres. There were lots of Good\nCadres and you never met the Bad ones, but somehow they seemed to decide\nhow everything worked.\nBack in December, Sunni, Adam, and I had written a short version of A\nChristmas Carol, so our speaking classes could perform the Dickens play.\nDuring our preparations, I was called into Dean Fu’s office, where he told me\nnervously that under no circumstances could we teach Christmas carols to the",
        "students.\n“You know that the Communist Party is very sensitive about spreading\nreligion,” he said. “I’m sorry, but the students are not allowed to sing\nChristmas songs in class.”\n“Can we talk about Christmas at all? They’re studying American\nculture.”\n“Yes. That is fine. But they can’t sing songs.”\n“What about songs that aren’t religious? There’s a part in the play where\nthey’re supposed to be singing Christmas songs, and I could have them sing\none that isn’t about religion at all. You know, in America for many people\nChristmas isn’t a religious holiday. For example, there’s a song that goes,\n‘We wish you a Merry Christmas, we wish you a Merry Christmas, we wish\nyou a Merry Christmas, and a Happy New Year!’”\n“No,” said Dean Fu, still smiling tightly. “I’m afraid that we can have no\nsongs about Christmas. I’m sorry, but you know it is not my decision.”\nI could have pointed out that even in spring the campus propaganda\nspeakers, as part of their noon entertainment program, often played a Muzak\nversion of “What Child Is This?” But I knew the argument was hopeless;\nthere was no logic to any of it. And in the same spirit I instructed my classes\nto replace the Christmas carols with patriotic Communist songs, which if\nanything improved Dickens. My favorite scene was when a furious Scrooge\nswung his cane at a band of merry carolers who were belting out “The East Is\nRed,” singing the praises of Mao Zedong while the old man shouted,\n“Humbug!”\nMost of our problems with the administration were more absurd than\nanything else, and rarely were they significant: I couldn’t care less about\nteaching Christmas carols. But it seemed that after a year and a half some of\nthis awkwardness should have passed; we should have become good enough\nfriends to speak comfortably about something so insignificant.\nBut other restrictions weren’t so minor. Sunni and Noreen’s Chinese\ntutors were two young women who worked in the English department, and\nover the course of the year they became good friends. During a holiday that\nspring, one of the teachers invited Sunni and Noreen to her home, and then, at\nthe last moment, revoked the invitation, explaining that there was a problem\nwith the road. It seemed strange—the spring rains hadn’t yet arrived and\nthere was no reason for a road to be washed out. And later we learned that",
        "department officials had instructed the young teacher not to invite the two\nwaiguoren to her home. Ostensibly the reason was that they were afraid\nsomething would happen to Sunni and Noreen, and the teacher would be\nresponsible. But more likely the command stemmed from the same shapeless\nparanoia that had shadowed us from the start—the sense that waiguoren were\npolitically risky and should be kept at a distance.\nThese commands always took place behind our backs, which was the\nworst part. It served to transfer the paranoia, until we overanalyzed every\nminor conversation and every small change of plans, looking for signs of\nmanipulation. When Sunni and Noreen told me about the canceled invitation,\nthe first thing I did was go to the local bus station, where the drivers said\nexactly what I expected—the road wasn’t washed out, which meant that\nsomebody in the college had lied to Sunni and Noreen. It was a classic\npattern in any Communist system, where fear and paranoia pass from one\nlevel to the next, creating a network of perfect distrust.\nBut increasingly we realized that this distrust was well earned; our\nparanoia wasn’t unfounded. We had friends who told us the way things\nworked, and it was startling to see the degree to which we were managed.\nWhen the movie Titanic came out that spring, one of our colleagues invited\nus to his home to watch the film on videodisc, but again the invitation was\nrevoked at the last moment. Later, he explained candidly that the cadres had\nbeen afraid that the waiguoren would realize that the movie was pirated—a\nlaughable cover-up considering that it was impossible to go anywhere in\nFuling without having a vendor shove a bootleg copy of Titanic in your face.\nThe movie was so popular that they hung an enormous promotional sign\nabove the local theater, a curious marriage of propaganda and advertising:\nThe Futong Jewelry Store is the Sole Sponsor of Titanic, Which Has\nBeen Recommended by President and Party Secretary Jiang Zemin.\nBy now the department commands were often doubly self-defeating: not\nonly did we realize that the movie was pirated, but we saw clearly the degree\nto which the college hoped to manipulate the world around us. At the same",
        "time, we recognized how inconsistent this control was, because in many other\nways the college gave us impressive leeway. This was particularly true with\nregard to our teaching, which logically should have been where we were\nrestricted the most. Apart from the occasional petty incident like Adam’s\nlecture or the Dickens play, our teaching freedom was arguably greater than it\nwould have been in America. Nobody checked our syllabi or hassled us about\ncourse content, and we structured our classes exactly as we wished. I was\nespecially impressed that they even let us teach classes like literature and\nculture, which often had strong political overtones.\nFor the most part they treated us well, and, considering Fuling’s\nremoteness and lack of foreigners, they trusted us quite a bit. But that final\nsmall step hadn’t yet been taken, and it was all the more frustrating because\nso many of the more important barriers were already gone. By the spring I\nrealized that these last obstacles would not be removed during my time in\nFuling, and I tried not to worry about it. Other aspects of life had gone much\nbetter.\nIn particular, our relations with the students had improved a great deal\nduring the second year. Much of this was because of Adam, who had always\nbeen a more dedicated teacher, spending extra time with the students and\nhelping them set up a library in our office. He was the first waiguoren teacher\nto really win their trust, and, since in their minds the two of us were virtually\nindistinguishable, it was natural that they extended this trust to me.\nBut also time made a difference—they had known us for two years. This\nwasn’t simply a matter of their coming to accept the waiguoren; we had\nchanged a great deal, and now we had a much better understanding of how to\napproach them. They could still count on our informality, which from the\nbeginning had distinguished us from other teachers on campus. But they also\nknew that we could be serious, and in those moments we weren’t\npropagandists; in particular, we tended to be blunt when it came to discussing\nAmerica. That semester I taught “Désirée’s Baby” and Langston Hughes,\nwhile Adam’s American Culture class focused on the civil rights movement.\nHe pulled no punches with that unit, which included videos of James\nMeredith lying beside a Mississippi highway, shot by a racist sniper. The\nstudents knew that nobody had forced Adam to show those films—he could\nhave given positive lectures about American success in technology, or\neconomics, or education—and it made the students more willing to be honest",
        "about things that they felt were important.\nAnother critical difference was that now we spoke Chinese. In the fall I\nhad first started talking with some of the students in Chinese when I met\nthem outside of class, because they liked to hear what I was learning. But as\ntime passed, I realized that this wasn’t simply a novelty; like me, they were\ncompletely different people when they spoke the language. They were much\nmore at ease, and this wasn’t just a linguistic issue; it was political as well.\nOne evening after Adam’s parents left, I was eating in the Students’\nHome when Jimmy, Mo, and George stopped by. They were three of my\nfavorite third-year students and we chatted lightly in English. They asked if\nAdam’s parents had enjoyed Fuling, and I said that they had, except that they\nweren’t particularly impressed by the cadres.\nThe three of them leaned close around the table. “Weishenme?” Jimmy\nasked softly. I answered in English: “Because they thought the waiban was\nrude to them, and they didn’t understand why.”\n“Women waiban gan shenme?”\nNow I responded in Chinese, telling them the story. In China it was\nseriously disrespectful to make somebody’s parents feel unwelcome, and\nthere was disappointment in the students’ eyes. I told them frankly about the\nway I saw the department, and how small incidents like this added up over\ntime. Mo and George were both Party Members; a year ago I would never\nhave spoken honestly to them in this way. But using Chinese made\neverybody more comfortable, including me.\nAs I began to meet the students more frequently outside of class, I\nnoticed how strong this pattern was: whenever something sensitive came up,\nwe handled it in Chinese. It amazed me, because English should have been\nour secret language—virtually nobody else could understand it off campus,\nand it was the safest way to discuss such topics without anybody hearing. But\neven in a crowded restaurant like the Students’ Home we switched to Chinese\nat key points, when we talked about politics, or sex, or our guanxi with the\ncollege. Even the best students often made that shift, despite their English\nbeing better than my Chinese.\nAt last I realized that the fear wasn’t of somebody else hearing. It was a\nquestion of comfort, because uncertain topics were more easily handled in\ntheir native language. But also I sensed that the true fear was of themselves:\nvirtually all of the limits had been established in their own minds. English",
        "had been learned at school, and thus it was indistinguishable from the\neducational system and its political regulations. When they spoke the\nlanguage, warning bells automatically went off in their heads—it was a\nschool language, as well as a waiguoren language, and in both of those\ncontexts they had been trained to think and speak carefully. Once I realized\nthat these limits were internal, I began to wonder if it was the same way with\nthe Bad Cadres. Perhaps they existed only in a small corner of the Good\nCadres’ minds, a nagging fear that got the best of everybody’s good\nintentions.\nTHAT SPRING A NUMBER OF THE BOY STUDENTS decided that\nthey needed English surnames. The foreign teachers had Chinese family\nnames; why should the students be different?\nI first noticed this trend when I was grading papers one day and thought:\nWho the hell is George Baker Frost? I had never heard of him before, but\nthere was his assignment with the name written proudly in enormous letters\nacross the top of the page.\nI read the paper and realized it had been written by George—the cockiest\nstudent in the class, a handsome boy who was also one of the best athletes.\nHe was a trend-setter, too, and soon I began to get assignments from William\nFoster, who had formerly been Willie, and who subsequently promoted\nhimself to William Jefferson Foster. It wasn’t long before William Jefferson\nFoster persuaded his girlfriend to become Nancy Drew (that was Adam’s\nrecommendation), and then Mo, who was the class monitor and couldn’t\nallow his authority to be undermined by any perceived shortcoming, started\nshopping for surnames. He asked me for suggestions, and soon he was\nsigning his papers Mo Money.\nSome of the boys undertook to improve Adam’s and my command of the\ndialect, and the people at the Students’ Home were very pleased when we\nbegan using the new words and phrases in daily conversation. “Now you are\na real Zhongguotong!” Huang Neng said proudly. “A China hand!”\nIt was only a matter of time before the department caught wind of this\ndevelopment, and one day George Baker Frost pulled me aside during a break\nin class. As a Party Member he had some of the clearest connections to the",
        "top.\n“The English department wants us to stop teaching you those words,” he\nsaid.\n“Those sons of turtles,” I said in Chinese. “They are very toothbrush.”\nGeorge grinned and glanced behind him. To say that somebody was\ntoothbrush was a particularly biting insult in the Chongqing dialect. In other\nparts of Sichuan it was completely meaningless, but for some unknown\nreason it carried heavy connotations along the eastern river valleys, where it\nwas used as an adjective. It meant, more or less, that you were useless.\n“We must be careful,” George said.\nI wanted to say: The walls have ears. But I smiled and nodded in\nagreement.\n“Maybe you should not say those words too close to the college,” he said.\n“Otherwise they will give us trouble.”\nWe agreed to a no-fire zone around the teaching building, but inevitably\nsuch limits failed. This was risky ground—calling people toothbrush was\neven more treacherous than singing Christmas carols—and soon our shared\ndissidence brought us even closer to the students. And by now the flow of\nlanguage, which went both ways, was out of control. Ever since we had\nstudied Jonathan Swift in the first semester, the students had been infatuated\nwith the word “yahoo.” It sounded like a Chinese word; in fact, it even had\nsome similarity with “toothbrush,” which was yashua. For whatever reason,\nthe students said “yahoo” constantly, and it was all the more charming\nbecause many of them, with their Sichuanese tendency to confuse the f and h\nsounds, pronounced it “yafoo.” That was also how Huang Kai said the word,\nwhich represented his first English lesson. Often when I came for lunch at the\nStudents Home he looked up at me and shouted, solemnly, “Yafoo!” As a\nliterature teacher I considered that to be perhaps my proudest achievement; I\nknew that Swift would have been thrilled to see this Chinese two-year-old\nstumbling around in his split-bottomed pants, calling foreigners yahoos.\nIn the fall Adam had started a Spanish class, which further complicated\nmatters. Soon tonto, or “stupid,” also became ubiquitous; along with yashua\nand “yahoo” it seemed to be everywhere, from the top floor of the teaching\nbuilding down to the Students’ Home. I almost felt sorry for the department\nofficials—I could only imagine how confused they were by all of this\nnonsense, and how the Bad Cadres were working overtime as they tried to",
        "assess the political risks of Jonathan Swift and Spanish stupidity. Probably\nthey were eager for us to leave and take all of these words with us; but there\nwere still several months to go, and three languages and one dialect provided\nenormous potential for abuse.\nAs a teacher I no longer felt the discomfort of my first spring—that sense\nof a waiguoren standing alone in front of the class—and this year’s students\nnever bowed their heads in shared shame. I was pleased to see that finally it\nwas possible to talk with them outside of class, and our relationship had a\ncombination of humor and seriousness that seemed perfect for China. For the\nfirst time, college life seemed human, and the students, who had so often\nstruck me as talented but unfortunate pawns, became much fuller figures in\nmy eyes.\nOne of my favorites was Linda, who felt no need for a last name. She was\npossibly the brightest of the third-year students, and the year before she had\nbeen nominated for a transfer to the Sichuan Foreign Language Institute in\nChongqing. That was a big step up from Fuling; every year a handful of elite\nstudents were selected to transfer, which meant that they were no longer\nlocked into the track of becoming peasant schoolteachers. But the selection\nprocess was both heavily political and prone to favoritism, and Linda had\nfailed the perfunctory physical exam because one of the physical education\nteachers held a grudge against her from freshman year. Actually, Linda was\none of the better athletes among the girl students, and this injustice caused\nquite a bit of anger in the English department, but there was nothing anybody\ncould do—the PE teacher had the final say. It was a typical example of the\nmindlessly cruel bullying that was routinely tolerated on campus, especially\nfrom the PE department.\nLinda handled it as well as one could expect. She was accustomed to that\ncombination of helplessness and strength—her mother had died not long\nbefore, and now in the spring her father was struggling with cancer. Both\nLinda and her sister had been to palm readers that spring, and in both cases\nthe fortune was the same: Your father will die soon. Adam and I saw that as\nan indication that one should avoid fortune-tellers, and we told Linda as\nmuch; but she knew that she was stuck with her fate, and so she bore it\nquietly. A few times that semester she traveled home for the weekend, but\nalways she kept up a front of normalcy. Even when her father became very ill\nshe remained the best student in class.",
        "One evening in the library she showed me her photo albums. Looking at a\nstudent’s album was always a strange experience, because the Chinese saw\nno purpose in pictures that did not feature themselves. For a people known\nfor modesty it always struck me as an odd chink in their armor, a sudden\nburst of narcissism—a photo album might have more than fifty face shots of\nthe owner. I never knew quite how to react: what do you say after looking at\nfifty photographs of a young woman’s face?\nAdam’s policy was to pause at every single picture and ask, “Who’s\nthis?”\n“That’s me!” the owner of the book would say.\nAdam would turn the page. “Who’s this?”\n“That’s me!”\nAdam found that routine endlessly entertaining; sometimes I had to leave\nthe office when he started it, so I wouldn’t hit him after hearing him ask the\nquestion for the twentieth time. I never had the patience, and so I flipped\nthrough Linda’s albums as quickly as I could without being rude. The photos\nconsisted of all the standard xiaojie poses—often in parks, rarely smiling;\nsometimes with hats, heavy makeup, a soft filter on the lens; holding a\nflower, chin turned up dreamily, back slightly arched. There were two albums\nand it took five minutes. After I was finished I gave them back and said,\n“Very beautiful!”\n“No, not very beautiful,” she said, and then she smiled. “But beautiful\nenough.”\nI realized that she was precisely correct—she was a pretty girl, but not so\npretty that it became a distraction or eclipsed her other talents. That was\nanother example of the sort of pragmatism that I often saw in Fuling, where\npeople seemed much more capable of viewing themselves with cold\njudgment than Americans. And mostly the people in Fuling tended to know\nexactly the hand they had been dealt. Linda had had more than her share of\nbad luck, but she also had her gifts, and she would do what she could with\nthose.\nOn another evening Adam and I ate dinner with her and Mo Money, and\nwe had a couple of beers and began to speak seriously in Chinese. The\nconversation turned to the pro-democracy demonstrations in Tiananmen\nSquare, which was a rare topic in Fuling. Most people had very little sense of\nwhat had happened in 1989; there had been some small protests in Fuling,",
        "with students marching down to South Mountain Gate, and people had heard\nvague rumors of violence in Chengdu and Beijing. But almost nobody had\nany sense of the massacre’s scale. One of the few exceptions was my\nphotographer friend Ke Xianlong, who listened carefully to the Voice of\nAmerica and knew that foreign reports estimated the death count to be at least\nin the hundreds.\nHe was one of the least patriotic Chinese I knew in Fuling. During my\nfirst year he had expressed his disdain for the students’ excitement about\nHong Kong’s return, which he attributed to their ignorance and immaturity.\nTo my surprise, he saw the pro-democracy movement in similar terms.\n“All of that was so stupid,” he told me once, when we talked about the\n1989 student movement. “Many of the problems the students criticized were\naccurate, of course, but what did they know about it? How could they lead\nthe country? Students are students. They don’t know anything about real life,\nbecause they’re too young. They’re not yet mature, and they haven’t ever\nworked like Old Hundred Names, which means that often they complain\nabout things they don’t understand.”\nWhen I thought about it, I could see his point, at least in the sense that it\nwas never a good sign when a nation turned to twenty-one-year-olds as its\nmoral voice. But it seemed horrible that China’s current crop of twenty-one-\nyear-olds had no clear idea of what had happened less than a decade earlier. I\nsaid this to Linda and Mo Money during our dinner, partly because I was\ninterested in seeing how they would react.\nMo Money was a Party Member, but the topic didn’t make him\ndefensive, and he didn’t deny what had happened, which was the\ngovernment’s stance. He knew that my information was probably more\naccurate than what the official sources said, and there was no point in arguing\nabout the extent of the crackdown.\n“But you have to understand,” he said, “there isn’t much I can do about\nwhat happened at that time. It’s not because I don’t care—I wish there was\nsomething that could be done about it. But that’s just not possible, so all I can\ndo is try to be a good student and then become a good teacher after\ngraduation. I think that’s all I can do.”\nIn many ways he reminded me of Teacher Kong, who was also a Party\nMember with an idealistic streak. Both men still had faith that the system\nwould work itself out eventually, and they believed that it required a certain",
        "amount of forgiveness, patience, and loyalty from people like themselves.\nTheir faith wasn’t so much specifically in Party theory as in the notion that\npeople like them could—and should—contribute to society, despite its flaws.\nIt was in some ways a democratic line of thought, or at least a hopeful\nlonging to find democracy buried somewhere within the corruption of the\ncurrent system. They simply couldn’t bear the thought of entirely refusing to\nparticipate.\nLinda wasn’t a Party Member, although I was certain that somebody so\ntalented could have joined if she had wished. I asked her why she had never\napplied.\n“I have no interest in joining the Party,” she said. “I’ve never wanted to\ndo that, and I don’t want to do it now. I think that these are important topics\nthat we are talking about, and perhaps someday there will be something I can\ndo. But right now it is too complicated.”\nShe spoke evenly and I saw that her response was as honest as Mo\nMoney’s. Both of them were disengaged from the problem, like virtually\neverybody I knew in Fuling, although Linda’s and Mo Money’s reasons were\ndifferent. Mo Money had decided that by being politically involved at the\nsmallest level he could somehow overcome his powerlessness with regard to\nbigger issues, while Linda simply had other things to worry about. She had\nalready been dealt enough cards; everything else could wait. Many people in\nFuling were like that, and after two years I finally understood why.\nIT WAS A DRY, DUSTY MARCH, and on the final weekend I went for a\nlong hike up the Wu River. It was the same weekend as last year’s walk, the\nsame route. I had always liked the cycles of the countryside and that was my\npersonal ritual, to camp beside the green springtime river at the end of March.\nI crossed the first two side valleys and came to the Fuling Liangtang ore\nfactory. Nothing here had changed in the past year, although now I could read\ntwo of the propaganda signs whose characters had been unrecognizable last\nyear:\nDiligence—Friendliness—Obedience",
        "Respect the Rules and All Will Be Glorious;\nBreak the Rules and the Operation of Machinery Can Cause Shame\nThree carts of gravel came hurtling down the hillside, the workers\ngrinning and hooting as they rode atop the piles of white rock. I passed last\nyear’s sign:\nHappy Happy Go to Work, Safe Safe Return Home.\nI decided that that would be my mantra for the day: happy happy, safe\nsafe. I repeated the words to myself as I hiked across the scarred hillside, and\nthen I descended into the deep green valleys whose streams washed westward\ntoward the Wu.\nSpring was everywhere in those valleys—the blooming paulownia trees,\nthe golden fields of rapeseed that shivered in the breeze, the eager plots of\nradish and lettuce and onions and broad beans. The rice seedlings were bright\nand green beneath sheets of plastic stretched taut over bamboo frames.\nI came to the fourth cross valley where a peasant was guiding a plow\nbehind a water buffalo. The man’s trousers were rolled up past his knees as\nhe waded in the muck. The air was sweet with the heavy scent of a nearby\nrapeseed plot. The old man’s wife and grandson were sitting beside the field,\nand I stopped to say hello.\nThe woman looked at me intently. “I saw you last year, didn’t I?” she\nasked.\n“Yes, I came through last year. I live in Fuling.”\nThe man stopped plowing and smiled. “I remember,” he said. “You had a\nmap and you were asking which way to go. But you didn’t understand what\nwe said, and you went the wrong way. We were trying to help!”\nI promised that this year I would get it straight. They asked what I did in\nFuling, and I told them I was a teacher.",
        "“He’s a teacher, too!” the woman said, gesturing at her husband. “He\nteaches in the elementary school, Monday to Friday, but on Saturday and\nSunday he works out here.”\nHe untied the buffalo, sending it off to graze in the rapeseed. The man\nwas fifty-four years old, small and thin and as strong as the ox he followed.\nHe had black hair in a neat crew cut, and I could see that he would look like a\nteacher if he cleaned up. But today was a peasant weekend; his legs were\ncovered with mud, and brown flecks ran up his clothes all the way to his hair.\nHe offered me a cigarette, lit one for himself, and sat on a rock. I dropped\nmy pack and rested in the sunshine. The man asked if I was German.\n“No,” I said. “I’m American.”\n“There was a German who came through here recently.”\n“Really? What was he doing?”\n“I’m not certain. He was studying something here. And he was walking\nvery fast—in the hills he walked even faster than the local people! He had a\ntranslator, and he was a rich man who had paid his way to China. What’s\nyour salary?”\nI told him, and he nodded. “That’s better than most. Teachers’ salaries\nhere in the countryside are much lower than that. But I think that German\nmade a lot more than you.”\nHis grandson was five years old and he darted behind me, laughing and\ngrabbing at my shirt. The man grinned and scolded him softly. “He’s very\nnaughty,” he said proudly. I nodded and rubbed the boy’s black head. I was\nthinking about the German—it amazed me that another waiguoren had come\nto this remote place. To be honest, it annoyed me; I had always liked to think\nthat I was the only one who had ever passed through this part of the\ncountryside.\nBack in the fall I had thought I saw another foreigner in Fuling, although\nI wasn’t certain—it was only a fleeting glance of a man entering a restaurant,\nand I couldn’t tell if he was actually a foreigner. The only confirmed\nwaiguoren sighting for my entire two years had been back in January, when\ntwo Danish tourists got stranded when their boat to Chongqing docked for\nrepairs. I ran into them at California Beef Noodle King USA, which was\nFuling’s closest approximation to a fast-food joint. The restaurant had spicy\nnoodles and I ate there once or twice a week, and often the owner asked me if\nshe was doing a good job of serving the proper California style. I always",
        "assured her that indeed it was precisely the same as what I would expect if I\nordered Beef Noodle King back in California, which always pleased her.\nThey even had the sign in English above the restaurant, and this was probably\nwhy the Danish women had gone inside.\nThey glanced sharply at me when I entered the restaurant, and then they\nlooked away, as if they hadn’t noticed. From my own trips in the past I knew\nthat this was a traveler’s routine—you came to a remote place and resented\nthe presence of any other tourists. But in Fuling I wasn’t a tourist, and to have\nother waiguoren treat me as if I had violated their solitude did not please me.\nI said nothing and sat at a table not far from the Danes.\nThey spoke no Chinese and hadn’t been in the country long. They\nordered by pointing at pictures on the wall, and the waitress asked them if\nthey wanted hot pepper on their noodles. The Danes did not understand, but\nthey could tell from the waitress’s tone that this was an important choice, and\nthey thumbed madly through a phrase book. I was resolved not to help until\nthey acknowledged my presence.\nThey kept working at the phrase book until finally the waitress, who\nknew me, asked if I would translate. The Danes acted very surprised that I\nwas there, and they said that they did not want hot pepper. I was tempted to\ntell the waitress that the Danes not only wanted hot pepper but seemed\nscornful of Sichuanese lajiao, scoffing that in the great country of Denmark\nsuch a mild spice would be considered candy for babies. But I told her the\ntruth; I realized that they were simply acting the way any traveler would, just\nas I had done myself in other places at other times.\nWe talked for a while and they couldn’t believe that I lived in a town like\nthis, because the attention in Fuling overwhelmed them.\n“These people,” one of the Danes said, “all they do is stare. Everywhere\nwe go, they stare at us. Do they stare at you, too?”\n“Yes,” I said, “but not as much as they stare at you.”\nI hadn’t intended it as an insult, but the women seemed to take it as such.\nI didn’t care enough to explain that I simply meant that the people were more\naccustomed to me. But I gave the Danes my phone number out of courtesy, in\ncase something went wrong, and then I left them to the stick-stick soldiers.\nHere in the countryside of the Wu River I thought about the German and\nwondered if this area would ever get to the point where waiguoren were\ncommon. The old woman saw me looking out at the scenery, and she asked if",
        "my home had hills like these.\n“Some places do,” I said. “But my home is flatter than Fuling.”\n“What’s the farming like?”\n“There aren’t very many farmers, and they have more land. One farmer\nmight have hundreds of mu. In my country the farms use machines.”\nThe man nodded. “It’s like Xinjiang,” he said, “and in the north of China,\nwhere there’s more land and it’s flat. They use machines there as well. But\nhere we can’t.”\nWe talked about farming and he asked me if it was true that peasants in\nAmerica used airplanes to plant rice. Quite a few people in the countryside\naround Fuling seemed to have heard about this; it was a common question\nwhen I walked in the fields. I always said that indeed Californian rice was\nsometimes sowed by plane, and often I could see the wheels turning in their\nheads as the Sichuanese peasants looked at the scene around them—the plow,\nthe ox, the primal muck—and tried to factor an airplane into the arrangement.\nToday the peasant shook his head and grinned, looking down at his legs,\nwhere the mud had dried yellow-brown. Beneath the layer of dirt his sinews\nwere taut and strong along his calves.\n“You came the same time last year, didn’t you?” he asked.\n“Yes, last year I also came in March.”\n“Did you notice that it’s different this year? Last year you saw that we\nhad so many more paddies with water, but this year the rains haven’t come\nyet, and everything is later than usual. It’s too dry.”\nFor a while he complained softly about the lack of rain, explaining that it\nwould set back the whole spring schedule. But all the peasants could do was\nwait, hoping to survive the dryness of a spring that had two fifth months.\nIT WAS WARM and I sweated under my pack. I stopped for lunch at the\nsame place as last year, on the bluffs high above the Wu. I looked down on\nthe river far below and thought: Happy happy, safe safe. The mist had faded\nand the sunlight flashed in streaks of gold along the river.\nPeople all through the hills remembered me from the year before. They\nalso talked about the German, who had left a deep impression. I stopped to\nrest at one peasant home and the people told me that he had worn boots like",
        "mine.\n“He was a zhuanjia—an expert,” an old man said. “He was studying the\ntrees here, I think. He came because this is such a poor area.”\nThe old man’s name was Yang. He gave me boiled water with sugar and I\nsat with him on his family’s threshing platform. There was the old man and\nhis son, the son’s wife, and a four-month-old baby. They were doing quite\nwell; for a decade they had had electricity. Their rice was growing thick\nunder plastic coverings. They had six pigs. They had a cat on a leash with a\nplastic Pepsi bottle tied to the other end. The bottle was partly filled with\nwater and it kept the cat from going very far. I had never much liked cats and\nthe Pepsi bottle struck me as a good idea.\nThe old man’s wife came out of the house. She was seventy-three years\nold and complained vehemently about their farm, which was in the most\nbeautiful valley I had passed through today. “It hasn’t rained for months!”\nshe said. “Last year at this time our fields were already flooded—look at this!\nIt’s horrible! This place is so poor!”\nThey were like farmers anywhere—pessimistic and angry at the weather.\nI often heard similar comments in the relatively affluent rural suburbs of\nFuling, where I sensed that these complaints were a form of humility that\nmasked contentment. And perhaps it was a sort of superstition, a way of\nguarding against the dangers of pride. Traditionally the Chinese did the same\nthing with children, trying not to lavish too much praise on a child because\nthe attention could draw bad luck.\nThe woman invited me to dinner, just as the teacher-peasant had done at\nmy first stop, and I explained that I had to continue hiking. In the countryside\nit was a common invitation—virtually every time I went for a long walk in\nthe fields somebody offered me a meal. It seemed that you could travel\nindefinitely in rural Sichuan without any money at all, because the people\nwere so generous that they considered it rude not to offer a meal or a place to\nstay.\nA while later I met a young man in his early twenties who was with his\nyounger brother, a twelve-year-old boy. The boy wore his school sweat suit\nand he recognized me immediately.\n“Are you the waiguoren who won the long race last year in Fuling?” he\nasked.\n“Yes.”",
        "“I’ve seen you near the college. I go to the East River Middle School.”\nThere were no middle schools in this part of the countryside and the\nchildren boarded in Fuling if they wanted to continue their education. The\nboy paid 170 yuan a month for room and board, and his older brother\nestimated that probably 90 percent of the children in this region continued\ntheir education to middle school. They took the boat downstream to Fuling\nand usually came home every other weekend.\nA group of children gathered around, staring. The twelve-year-old boy\ntold them that I was the waiguoren who had won the Fuling long race, which\nhe described in vivid detail, emphasizing the great distance by which I had\ntriumphed. I was embarrassed to hear the story, although by now I was used\nto it; even after more than a year it was the reason many people in Fuling\nknew who I was.\nIt impressed me that so many of the students in this remote area traveled\nall the way to Fuling for school, and I realized that these were the sort of\nchildren that my own students would teach after graduation. Here I could see\nthe point of my job—not just the literature I taught, but also the simple fact\nthat for nearly two years I had had a role in an education system that included\nchildren like this.\nI felt the same way whenever I hiked into the fields behind college and\nsaw the students doing their homework on their families’ threshing platforms.\nOn sunny afternoons there was a child on virtually every platform—Fuling\nschools assigned an enormous amount of homework, and the students did it\nwith remarkable diligence, even if they were from uneducated peasant\nfamilies. I had come to recognize this as perhaps the characteristic that I\nadmired the most about the local people: they had an enormous respect for\neducation, and it was easy to feel good about teaching in a place like that.\nIn this respect my views had changed quite a bit from the spring of my\nfirst year, when I had been so pessimistic about the education system’s\nconstant propaganda. In some ways, it helped to get outside of the classroom\n—when I walked through the hills and saw the children doing their\nschoolwork, it reminded me of my own students, and the places where they\nhad come from and the places where they would someday return to teach. I\ncame to realize that, although much of the propaganda still disgusted me, it\nwasn’t necessarily the most important issue. The slogans wouldn’t last\nforever—nothing in China did—but the children who were educated would",
        "stay that way, regardless of the country’s changes.\nWHENEVER I WAS UNCERTAIN about which way to walk, I simply\nasked the people where I had gone last year. Everybody knew—it seemed\nthere wasn’t a single person who didn’t remember me. And they all talked\nabout the German, too; I wished I could have met him, because now I was\ncurious about what he had been studying. It was like following Kurtz up the\nCongo; I kept hearing snatches of information, details about the way he\nwalked and how much money he had and the boots he wore. And then I\nrealized that he must have heard about me as well, and that probably he had\nfelt he was following some unknown waiguoren through the rugged hills of\nthe Wu River valley.\nIn late afternoon I began to make my way down toward the river. I came\nthrough a sunny valley that opened onto a broad square field with houses in\nthe corners. I stopped to rest and a group of peasant women gathered around.\nMost of them were in their sixties, dressed in blue, and I told them that this\nwas a beautiful area.\n“This place isn’t any good,” one of them said. “This is a qiong shanqu—a\npoor mountainous region. The economy here is terrible.”\nI always complimented peasants so I could hear them run down the\nplaces where they lived. They never seemed happier than when they stood\nthere in the sunshine, next to the flourishing rapeseed and wheat and young\nrice, and talked about what a miserable home they had.\nA young girl came up to me. “Are you the waiguoren in Fuling who does\nlong runs?”\n“Yes.”\nShe turned to the old women. “They had a long race in Fuling and he was\nthe best.”\n“That’s why he can walk out here,” one of the women said. “He’s very\nhealthy. Look how few clothes he’s wearing!”\n“Look how big his bag is!” said another. “How heavy!”\n“His feet are so big—look at those enormous shoes!”\nThey studied me for a while and I waited for somebody to ask about my\nsalary. But one of the women turned to me and asked instead, “In your",
        "country, do you have planned-birth policy?”\n“No. You can have as many children as you want.”\nThey shook their heads, amazed. I told them that in America there wasn’t\na population problem, and so the rules were different from those in China.\n“How many children are in your family?” one of the women asked.\n“Four. Three sisters and me.”\n“Here you can’t do that,” she said. “Only one—if you have another, you\nhave to pay a fine.”\n“More than ten thousand yuan!” another woman interjected.\nSome children had come over to look at me, and I noticed two small boys\nstanding together.\n“What about them?” I asked. “They look like brothers.”\n“That’s right,” the old woman said. “Their parents had to pay a fine.”\nOne of the boys was about four years old; his brother was six or seven.\nThey were filthy, and they stood tentatively on a wheat terrace above us,\nafraid of the waiguoren. A little girl of about five came over—a tiny thing\nwith wild black hair and dirt-smudged cheeks. Wide-eyed, the child stared at\nme. She had enormous coal-black eyes, like my youngest sister, Birgitta,\nwhen she was little. I smiled, and the girl smiled back.\n“She’s the third in her family!” one of the women said.\n“Oh,” I said. “They must have paid a big fine.”\n“No,” the woman said. “Their house was tuile!”\n“What?”\n“Their house was tuile!”\n“Tuile?”\n“Right!”\nI couldn’t believe it, so I quickly sketched the character on my notebook.\n“This tui?”\n“That’s right.”\nIt meant any number of things: to push, turn, cut, infer, shift, postpone,\nelect. But when you tui’ed a house it meant simply that you knocked it over.\nThe local planned-birth officials had pushed over the girl’s house because she\nhad been the third child.\nI had read of such things in the foreign press, but I had always assumed\nthat they only happened in very remote areas. But then I realized that I had\nbeen walking all day, and this small beautiful valley was nothing if not",
        "remote.\nThe old women were shaking their heads and looking at the little girl. She\nwasn’t comfortable hearing this conversation and something in her\nexpression said: Sorry. Undoubtedly there were complications to growing up\nwhen you knew that your birth had caused your family’s home to be knocked\nover. But there was also something else in her eyes; it was vague and\nundefined and meant, essentially: Some things are worth more than money\nand houses. The old women saw it, too. One of them tousled the girl’s hair,\nand then she ran off to play with the other children in the unplowed fields.\nI DIDN’T MAKE IT TO LAST YEAR’S CAMPSITE. I spent too much\ntime talking with people, and finally I pulled up short. But I found a good\nspot in the hills high above the Wu River, where I ate dinner and read Ted\nWilliams’s autobiography. I decided that I would read that book every spring\nfor the rest of my life. He wasn’t particularly happy happy whenever he went\nto work for the Red Sox, and I respected that. Also there was something\ndistinctly American about his voice—the cockiness and the earthy slang and\nthe rhythms of his prose. And especially I liked the way the book began:\n“I wanted to be the greatest hitter who ever lived….”\nIn the morning I broke camp early and caught a boat downriver. The\nwater level was low and the limestone cliffs along the bank were white and\nclean-looking, streaked by diagonal grooves and cuts jutting up from the\nchalky green Wu. Fifteen feet above the waterline I could see the dark\nsmudge on the rocks where the summer river would rise. It was Sunday and\nthe boat was crowded with peasant children heading back to school. I stood at\nthe stern and watched the white cliffs slip past in the mist, knowing that I\nwould never see this part of the river again. That was my last spring in\nFuling.",
        "THE RIVER\nTHE RIVER IS THE QUICKEST WAY out of Chongqing. The city has a\nnew airport and a new expressway, and the railroad, although now aging, was\na technological breakthrough when it was completed in 1952—the first great\npostwar achievement of Deng Xiaoping, acting as Mao’s lieutenant in the\nsouthwest. But none of them has improved on the Yangtze. The trains are\nslow, and road traffic is bad, and, because of pollution and the river-valley\nfog, planes are often delayed. The convenience of the river has always been\nhere, and in one form or another it always will be.\nToday the Zhonghua, the six-o’clock slow boat, is preparing to leave\nChongqing, and its passengers are more than ready to go. It has been a\nstifling June day, the sunshine filtered hot and humid through the city’s coal-\ntinted haze, and the travelers are tired and grumpy. Many of them are tourists;\nthey have come from all across China, arriving on crowded trains and\nheartbroken old buses. Tempers have melted in the Sichuan heat. Ten\nminutes before departure, an argument breaks out between a passenger and a\nworker on the top deck.\nThe passenger is big, with a bull neck and short bristly hair and heavy\nuseful hands. His eyes are tight black beads of anger in a round face that\nglistens with sweat. He is moneyed—this is obvious from his clothes, from\nhis slick-shined shoes and his silk shirt, and mostly it is obvious from his\nstatus as a tourist. Domestic tourism in China has boomed in the last decade,\nbut still the average Chinese does not travel far simply for pleasure. Tourists\nlike this man are part of a new class, and often their money is tangible in the\nway it literally surrounds their persons: in the fine clothes that they wear, in\nthe beepers and cell phones that are clipped to their belts, and, often, in the\nsimple well-fed bulk of their bodies.\nMoney is the problem today; the passenger is not satisfied with the\nquality of his third-class cabin. He purchased his ticket from a broker at",
        "Chongqing’s Chaotianmen Docks, where he was promised a fine boat, and\nthe Zhonghua—serviceable but worn, its decks grimy with river filth—is not\na fine boat. The passenger has come a long way to see the Three Gorges, he\nsays, and his ticket was not cheap. His slurred words are angry and in one\nmeaty fist he grabs the worker’s shoulder epaulet, holding the man close\nwhile speaking loudly in his face.\nThe worker is smaller, a young man in his late twenties who is too weak\nto pull himself free. He wears a dirty blue-and-white-striped uniform shirt,\nand speaking rapidly he tries to defend himself: he did not sell the tickets, he\nhas no connection to the broker at Chaotianmen, and the passenger should not\nbe so pushy. But by now a crowd has gathered, and their voices begin to rise\nin shared complaint, until at last the worker’s superior arrives to rescue him.\nThe passenger keeps his hold on the worker while directing his\ncomplaints to the superior, who makes the same excuses that have already\nbeen made, but he makes them with more confidence. For a few minutes the\nconfrontation is at a standstill, but the crowd shifts restlessly, sensing a\nconclusion.\nFinally the big man says, “Do you have any second-class cabins?” And as\nsimply as that the dispute is resolved. Money is exchanged; the tourist and\nthe supervisor shake hands. The big man passes out cigarettes to everybody\ninvolved. The crowd disperses. The little man, his pride wounded, smoothes\nhis crumpled epaulets and retreats to the rail of the deck with his ill-bought\ncigarette. Nobody notices him—and then the Zhonghua sounds its horn and\npushes away from the dock, and the argument is forgotten as the passengers\nwatch the city slip past, the boat floating out into the heart of the great wide\nYangtze.\nTHREE MILES NORTH OF CHONGQING, the river abruptly turns east,\nthe bend marked by a shrine to Buddha and an old weather-stained pagoda\nperched high above the water. The hills begin to rise—green rugged hills,\nfalling away to blanched sheets of limestone stained by last year’s high-water\nmarks. Many of these slopes are too steep for factories or apartment\nbuildings, and small farms become more common as the boat cruises east.\nThe peasants’ homes are simple: mud or brick walls topped by a gray tiled",
        "roof. Often they are shaded by clusters of banana trees. And all along the\nriver are crop terraces, carved into the sloping hills where factories can find\nno foothold.\nThe scenery is quietly beautiful—not breathtaking, but mesmerizing in\nthe gentle roughness of the hills and the broken regularity of the terraced\nfields. And just as quietly Chongqing has been left behind, and suddenly it is\nclear that everything in this landscape has been shaped by the steady power\nof the Yangtze.\nFor the river here has strength. Sometimes it widens to several hundred\nfeet, and sometimes it is pinched close between steep hills, but always the\ncurrent is powerful. The Yangtze carries snowmelt from the western\nmountains, and it has already been joined by most of its seven hundred\ntributaries, and so it slips quickly through the hills. Of the world’s great\nrivers, only the Amazon pushes more water to the sea.\nThe sun is dropping now and a soft cooling breeze sweeps across the\nriver. Most of the travelers stand on the Zhonghua’s deck, watching the hills\nslip past. A cluster of Guangdong businessmen hold cell phones to their ears,\nchattering loudly in Cantonese. A young woman stands alone against the rail,\nher long black hair and short pink skirt flowing in the wind.\nThe air is clean now, with only a few wispy clouds scratched across the\nfading blue dome of the sky. The small fishing sampans are starting to dock\nfor the evening, and the Zhonghua passes a group of children playing\nbarefoot in the shallows. Corn stands high in the hills. The crop is two\nmonths old and it has just begun to ripen; the stalks are a fresh spring green\nbut the tips are starting to fade toward gold.\nThere is no rice growing on the riverbanks; the hills are too steep for that.\nSome of the slopes are too rocky for corn, but even in the roughest land there\nis always some sign of cultivation—at the least, a single patch of corn tucked\ninto a break in the rock. The crop rows are vertical, running down the\nhillside, and they have been half-terraced and leveled as much as possible.\nIt is not an easy place to make a living. Even the most successful farms—\nthe ones with two-story houses, large pig huts, big cement threshing\nplatforms, and a dozen corn plots carved into the hillside—even these farms\nspeak of the difficulty of growing crops in such a landscape. Every terrace\nhas been shaped by human effort, by successive generations of the same clan,\nby decades and perhaps centuries of work. All of it consisted of the simple",
        "labor of hands and feet and basic tools, and the terrain has been changed so\ngradually that the work of the peasants seems as inevitable as a force of\nnature—something as determined and powerful as the river itself. Human\nhistory sits heavily on the land, as it so often does in China.\nThe sun sets. The sky glows orange, the hills darken, the round ball of the\nsun sends a bright band of light skipping along the boat’s wake. And then,\nbehind the western hills, the sun sets.\nIN A THIRD-CLASS CABIN a young man and woman arrange their\nluggage on the floor. They could be eighteen years old or they could be\nthirty; like many young Chinese, they simply look young. There are eight\nberths in the cabin, stacked in bunks of two. An old woman sitting on a lower\nbunk asks the couple if the last two beds are theirs.\n“We’re sharing a berth,” the young woman says. “We were just married.”\nThere is nothing unusual about passengers sharing beds, but the young\nwoman’s husband reddens in embarrassment. The woman, pretty with short\nbobbed hair, smiles and touches his shoulder.\nThe two women talk politely for a while. They ask each other if they have\neaten, and where they are going, and what they were doing in Chongqing.\nThe married couple is returning home to Yichang, the old woman to Wuhan,\nand none of them has anything good to say about Chongqing.\n“It’s very backward,” says the old woman, shaking her head. “The\npeople’s salaries are too low, the cost of living too high.”\nThe young woman agrees, remarking that the Chongqing transportation is\ninconvenient, and that the city is not as good as Yichang.\nHer husband says nothing. He helps his wife slip off her shoes, and then\nhe climbs into bed beside her. By the light of the cabin he reads a magazine\nwhile she dozes. The bunk is less than three feet wide but they lounge\ncomfortably.\nThe nighttime river is peaceful. The summer stars are out tonight; the Big\nDipper glows steady above the gently rocking boat, and a quarter-moon\nhangs bright in the southern sky. The Yangtze is black except for the lights\nthat streak across its water. By now there are few homes along the banks, and\neven fewer with their lights on. Most of the light comes from the river—from",
        "the low strips of sandstone along shore, faintly luminescent in the evening,\nand from the dinghies and the shore markers. Red lights blink on the south\nside of the river, green on the north; the night boats pass between, their\nsearchlights sweeping silently across the water.\nAt night there are no hydrofoils, no fishing boats, no two-man sampans.\nOccasionally the Zhonghua passes a long flat bank where the smaller boats\nhave docked for the night, pulled onto shore next to bamboo shacks whose\nwindows glow warmly—makeshift restaurants, hotels, mah-jongg parlors.\nThe barge traffic has all but stopped.\nMost of the other boats on the river are big passenger ships that pass like\nfloating islands of light. Some have come upstream all the way from\nShanghai, traveling through the flats of Anhui province, past the lakes of\nHubei, the factories of Wuhan, the cliffs of the Three Gorges, and now, a few\nhours outside of Chongqing, they are nearly home.\nAfter a while the young woman wakes up. She shifts in the bunk, drawing\nclose to her husband. “Ni shi shei?” she says softly, playfully. “Who are\nyou?”\nHer husband murmurs something in response and she laughs quietly. The\ndoor to the cabin is open, and outside there is the steady hum of the motor\nand the gentle sound of the river slapping against the hull of the boat. “Who\nare you?” the woman whispers again. “Who are you?”\nFEW PASSENGERS DISEMBARK AT FULING. Most are going another\ntwo days through the Gorges to Yichang, or three nights to Wuhan. And so\nFuling appears like a break in a dream—the quiet river, the cabins full of\ntravelers drifting off to sleep, the lights of the city rising from the blackness\nof the Yangtze.\nFour hours have passed since Chongqing. Lights cluster on the banks:\nhomes, factories, cars. A newly constructed bridge slips overhead. The boat’s\nloudspeakers crackle, announcing that Fuling is the next stop, and then the\ndream of the river is over and the city comes into view.\nThe heart of Fuling is built up around a cove in the river. From the broad\narc of this cove the city rises on steep hills like a curtain patchworked with\nlights—the weak lights of shopkeepers’ lamps, the flashing beams of",
        "motocab headlights, the steady yellow squares of windows—and this well-lit\ncurtain falls and flickers above the black water of the Yangtze. The Zhonghua\nmoves toward the shore, its horn booming, gradually bringing the dock\ncloser. The boat draws southward until it is out of the main current of the\nriver, until the great force of the Yangtze has been left behind, and then it\ndocks.",
        "CHAPTER TWELVE",
        "Upstream\nIN LITERATURE CLASS for that last semester we studied Washington\nIrving, Edgar Allan Poe, Mark Twain, Kate Chopin, Jack London, Robert\nFrost, and Langston Hughes, and then for the last unit I assigned Amy Tan\nand some Chinese-American poets. The literature came at the students from\nfar away—Rip Van Winkle and the jumping frog and Hughes’s distant rivers\n—but then suddenly we were watching the end of the Joy Luck Club movie,\nwhen the Chinese-American narrator comes to China and meets her sisters. It\nwas the first time that China truly entered my literature class; the students had\nperformed Shakespeare with Chinese Characteristics, and they had written\nabout Robin Hood coming to China, but these had only been ways of putting\nforeign literature into familiar contexts. Now we were really here: the\nnarrator was embracing her long-lost sisters, and all of the girls in my class\nwere crying, and most of the boys were trying hard not to.\nAfterward I asked them to write about their families, describing their\nparents’ and grandparents’ lives. One student, a girl named Dina, wrote a\npoem:\nLooking Back at My Ancestors\nA weak woman,\nSitting in a shabby hut\nSpinning yarn again and again\nShe can’t go out\nAs she was fettered by feudalism deeply",
        "In 1921\nThe CPC was founded\nMy grandmother went out for revolution\nTo Shanghai, to Chongqing\nMost of our country had her track.\nMy mother, a young woman\nDuring the Great Cultural Revolution\nActed as a Red Guard\nDenied all the advanced thing\nCalling Long Live Chairman Mao.\nMany of them, like Linda, wrote about life in the countryside:\nMy great grandmother was born of a poor family. She had to be as a\nservant for a landlord. She suffered a lot. She doesn’t have enough food\nto feed in, and doesn’t have enough clothes to shelter from cold. She\nwas treated unfairly by her master.\nAlso, my grandmother’s situation didn’t improve much. Her feet were\nalso banded with great pain. She had given five children’s birth.\nUnfortunately, three of them dided of hunger. This made my\ngrandmother very sad. She cried and cried for three days. And what was\nworse her husband dided of illness. She became a widow for thirty years\nthrough hardship and difficulties.\nMy mother’s life was a little better than them, since she was born just\nwhen the New China was born. My mother was not very tall, but she\nwas very kind and beautiful. She treated us tenderly. Of course, her life\nwas not very satisfactory at all. She had to make a living by hard work.\nShe went out on cold days for getting grass for pigs; carried coal from\nfar away for heat; and she stayed up sewing for us. She contributed her\nlife to her family.",
        "Nearly all of the papers were like that, and I found that I could not grade\nthem—not even a check in the corner. There was nothing about them that I\ncould touch, and some of them I could hardly read, because they were so\npoignant. In the end I couldn’t bring myself to return the stories, and so I kept\nthem, simply telling the students that everybody had done a good job.\nTheir writings made me think about the future as much as the past. I saw\nthe steady quiet struggle that had taken the students to where they were now,\nand for the next generation it would probably look much the same. I\nimagined Linda’s own daughter as a young woman—perhaps a college\nstudent with a life that was a notch better than her mother’s. And I imagined\nher writing, “My mother was not very tall, but she was very kind and\nbeautiful….”\nAFTER CLASS I often walked in the countryside behind campus. I had\nstopped running and it was pleasant to walk—everything had slowed down; I\ncould talk with the peasants and watch them do their work. Often they asked\nif I knew the waiguoren who ran in the hills, and I told them that it was\nsomething I no longer did, which seemed to relieve them. There had never\nbeen any point to charging up Raise the Flag Mountain.\nIn the evenings and on weekends I followed my city routines. Sunday\nmornings had been refined to perfection—church, the priest, the blacksmiths,\nthe teahouse, and then I ordered dumplings from a restaurant across the street\nfrom the South Mountain Gate Park. The dumplings were the best in Fuling\nand usually I started eating at eleven o’clock sharp, when the twelve-piece\nbrass band began to play in the park. The band was hired almost every\nSunday morning for weddings, because a good wedding attracted as much\nattention as possible—there was big face in that. The band played “Auld\nLang Syne” and “Oh Come All Ye Faithful” and sure enough the stick-stick\nsoldiers always came faithfully, gawking at the bride as she arrived in bright\nmakeup and a full dress.\nAt the restaurant I usually took one particular seat where I could lean\nback against the wall and look out at the street and the park. Once the weather\nturned warm, the parade of everyday life on the sidewalk was even better\nthan the band—peasants with their baskets, families with their children,",
        "young couples out for a stroll, old women with umbrellas held against the\nsunshine.\nDuring the week I often visited Gao Ming and Ma Fulai, two friends\nwhom I had met in the park during the Spring Festival. Gao Ming was an\nartist; he was twenty-six years old and a few years earlier he had graduated\nfrom the Sichuan Institute of Fine Arts. He was quite gifted—his apartment\nwas full of fine oil paintings that he had done in school, mostly in a European\nstyle. He owned his own business in Fuling, and his company specialized in\nmassive sheets of frosted glass upon which he painted and etched flowers,\nbamboo groves, panda bears, and other Chinese motifs. Generally the glass\nwas set into dividers and walls of expensive restaurants and apartments, and\nGao Ming was particularly good at this kind of work, which meant that his\nsheets of frosted glass were particularly tacky. This was no fault of his; he\nsimply painted what people asked him to paint, and usually they asked him to\ncram as many shapes and colors as possible onto a sheet of frosted glass.\nHis clientele was the Fuling rich, and sometimes I accompanied him as he\nwent to their apartments to make deliveries or take orders. Every rich person\nin the city seemed to decorate in precisely the same way, with certain objects\nthat were universally accepted in Fuling as signs of wealth: Gao Ming’s style\nof glasswork, ornate ceiling lights surrounded by baroque constructions of\nplaster and velvet, odd wooden trellises that were covered with plastic vines\nand grapes. Another common decoration was an enormous wooden watch\nthat hung on the wall as a clock. And of course they always had top-of-the-\nline televisions, VCD players, and karaoke machines. These people were\nwhat you would call nouveaux riches in other countries, but in Fuling such a\nterm was meaningless unless you kept track by the minute. There were no\nvieux riches and I didn’t blame them for showing off what they finally had.\nI liked going with Gao Ming on his rounds, and none of the rich people\nseemed to mind, because having a waiguoren in your apartment was even\nclassier than a trellis full of fat plastic grapes. But the rich people themselves\nwere the best decorations of all. Invariably the men had big hair-sprayed\npompadours and flashy silk shirts, and the women, whose faces were\nspectacularly made up, wore see-through dresses and lounged on overstuffed\ncouches. I never could figure out what they did all day long, especially the\nwomen; they usually looked as if they had just arrived or were getting ready\nto leave. And yet they always sat there on the couches.",
        "Gao Ming made more than ten thousand yuan a month, but he had\nconstant employee problems and his life was a mess. He had a seven-month-\nold daughter who lived with his wife, a Chongqing-based artist, and Gao\nMing had taken advantage of this job-related separation to find a girlfriend in\nFuling. When his wife finally heard about this arrangement, she took the\nbaby off to Henan province, where she found another job. She was\nthreatening to get a divorce, which didn’t seem to faze Gao Ming; he was\nconfident that she would return, although at the same time he made no effort\nto get rid of his girlfriend, who was a classic raspy-voiced Sichuanese xiaojie\nwith a sharp wit. Gao Ming simply wasn’t one to worry about the future; his\ngoal was to have a good time, and so he gambled, went to karaoke bars, and,\nI suspected, hired prostitutes—certainly he talked about them a lot. Some\ndays he lost as much as eight hundred yuan playing mah-jongg. He was a\nlousy mah-jongg player.\nHe liked talking with me about these problems because he assumed that I\nunderstood his lifestyle, which in his opinion was distinctly American.\n“People’s minds in our China still aren’t very open,” he told me once. “In\nyour country you can have a friend who is a girl, but here it always causes a\nproblem. My wife is like that, because she isn’t open-minded.” I didn’t know\nhow to respond to that—having affairs wasn’t exactly my vision of the\nbenefits of Reform and Opening. Usually I said nothing at all; as a waiguoren\nI was often most comfortable when I was listening.\nOn warm nights Gao Ming sometimes told me about his troubles while\nwe ate hot pot, which was a specialty of eastern Sichuan. It’s meaningless to\nsay that hot pot was spicy—everything the people ate in Sichuan was spicy,\nfrom breakfast rolls dipped in hot pepper to kongpao chicken. Some Peace\nCorps volunteers developed ulcers from the sheer heat of the food.\nBut even in such a cuisine, hot pot stood out as particularly spicy:\nvegetables, meat and noodles cooked in hot oil over an open flame right at\nyour table. People ate it year-round, but it was particularly popular in the\nsummer; the theory was that the hot pot made you sweat, and the sweat made\nyou cool.\nHot pot stands appeared on the Fuling sidewalks during summer\nevenings, when it became as much a social event as a meal—you sat in front\nof the bubbling pot, gazing at the pedestrians as they paraded past. Gao Ming\nand I would eat slowly, watching for xiaojies, and if he was in a good mood",
        "he talked about things he hoped to buy. Once or twice on bad days he spoke\nof his possible divorce. But usually he saw the bright side of things, and\nseveral times he described the wedding ceremony he’d like to have with his\nwife if they didn’t get divorced first. They had been married for five years,\nbut like many people in Fuling, they had postponed the wedding until they\nwould have enough money to afford an impressive ceremony. Now Gao\nMing had the cash but not the wife; fortunately, he was enough of an optimist\nto overlook this awkward fact, speaking fondly of the magnificent wedding\nhe had in mind. “I’ll rent lots of cars,” he told me one night. “Ten cars—there\nwill have to be at least ten cars. We’ll drive around South Mountain Gate and\nup to Gaosuntang, and out to the East River district, and then we’ll drive\nback. Everybody out on the street will stop to watch.”\nIn some respects, Gao Ming’s friend Ma Fulai was similar: he also had a\nbaby daughter, a wife, and a girlfriend. But he had made the mistake of\ncollecting all of these in Fuling, and he was a tortured soul without any of\nGao Ming’s blithe hopefulness. Ma Fulai often came to me for advice, partly\nbecause he assumed that an American would know how to solve such\ncomplications. But I also sensed that he talked with me because he knew that\nas a waiguoren I was outside the loop. A few of my city friends saw me in\nthis light; they knew that I wasn’t connected to the local gossip networks, and\nso they told me their secrets and asked for advice.\nOne night in late April, Ma Fulai came to my apartment and sat smoking\nin my living room. I could see that he was upset, but he wouldn’t say what\nwas wrong. We talked for a while and then I tried being direct.\n“Are you having some problem with your wife?”\nHe nodded and blew out a cloud of smoke. But still he said nothing.\n“Does she have another boyfriend?” I knew this probably wasn’t the\nissue, but it seemed an easy way to open things. He shook his head quickly.\n“That’s not it,” he said. “The problem is just that we don’t get along. We\nhave nothing in common—no hobbies, no interests, nothing. We fight all the\ntime. It’s been like that since we were married.”\n“Why did you marry?”\n“Because of her parents. Her father and mother put pressure on me.”\n“How did they do that?”\n“Maybe you don’t understand. Here in our China it’s not like it is in your\ncountry. Here if you start to have guanxi with somebody, with a girl, then you",
        "have to get married.” He sighed and drew on his cigarette. “What I mean is,\nonce you start sexual guanxi, you have to get married. So that’s what\nhappened with my wife and me. I was twenty-four and she was twenty-two.\nSo I married her, even though I knew we weren’t suitable.”\nI said nothing. It was seven o’clock on a warm night, and I let him think\nfor a while in the fading twilight.\n“I don’t know what to do,” he said. “Do you have any advice?”\n“It’s very complicated. Perhaps there’s no easy solution.”\n“All day long I think of this problem. It gives me a headache. All day\nlong, that’s what I think about.”\n“I know that Gao Ming has a girlfriend,” I said. “Do you have one?”\nThere was a pause, and then he nodded.\n“Who is it?”\n“She’s a student here at the college. Remember the girl I come to see\nsometimes on campus? She’s not really my cousin, like I told you before. We\nget along very well. In all respects I like her better than my wife.”\nI had assumed that she was his girlfriend; nothing of that sort surprised\nme. Adam had young male friends in town who were much the same way—\ndivorced or on their way to it, with small children and shifting girlfriends. It\ndidn’t seem nearly as common among campus workers, and probably this\nwas also true in other traditional danweis, but many of the young people\ninvolved in business seemed to be having affairs. They had money, and they\nweren’t tied to an old-style work unit that could influence and even regulate\ntheir behavior; yet at the same time they followed the standard Fuling pattern\nof marrying and having their child as quickly as possible. I asked Ma Fulai if\nhis wife knew about his girlfriend.\n“No,” he said. “She has no idea.”\n“Are you sure? Gao Ming’s wife was all the way in Chongqing but she\nstill found out about his girlfriend.”\n“My wife doesn’t know; I’m certain of it. If I ever go anywhere with the\ngirl, we go someplace where there aren’t any other people.”\nI wondered where in Fuling that might be, and I thought that I might like\nto go there myself sometime. Ma Fulai sighed again.\n“My marriage is very bad,” he said. “The only good thing is my daughter\n—other than her, we have nothing in common. We never talk and we don’t\neat together. We sleep in separate beds. You’ve seen my apartment—each of",
        "us has a separate room, and I sleep in the small bed. Her parents and her\nbrothers are like strangers to me. They know I don’t love her.”\n“What does she want to do about it?”\n“She doesn’t want to do anything.”\n“Why not?”\n“Because she loves me. And maybe she thinks this is the way a marriage\nshould be.”\n“What do you want to do?”\n“I don’t know,” he said. “Do you have any ideas? What would people do\nin your country?”\n“This problem is the same in my country. It’s bad to divorce with a small\nbaby. But if there was no baby of course they’d divorce very quickly.”\n“It’s not the same here,” he said. “Divorce isn’t very easy, even if you\ndon’t have a child. It’s because the thought here is still so traditional and\nclosed. It’s like it might have been in your country in the 1940s and 1950s.\nThe problem is that women aren’t the same as men—they still aren’t equal.\nSo a divorce affects them very much. A divorced woman has no face.”\n“What about a man?”\n“It’s not very good either; some people will say you’re a bad man. But\nit’s not nearly as bad as it is for the woman. All of these ideas are very\nbackward here, like the attitudes toward sex—the way you have to marry\nsomebody if you have sex with her. It’s better in your country. I don’t like\nother things about your country, but I wish that in this way China was the\nsame as America.”\n“In America there are too many divorces,” I said. “People think it’s too\neasy. So perhaps it’s not good in either place.”\nWe sat in silence for a while. It was nearly dark and I had no advice to\ngive him. I said the same things I always said—move slowly, be patient,\nthink about the baby. He had heard it all before, and he sat there shaking his\nhead.\n“Everybody has this problem,” he said. “Young people, old people—all\nof them have the same problem. It’s because they have to get married so\nsoon, because there’s no sexual freedom. Probably 80 percent of them are\nunhappy like me. All of my friends are unsatisfied with their marriages, but\nthey know that divorce is difficult, too. Perhaps you don’t understand this,\nbut it’s a serious problem.”",
        "He asked me if he could sit in my apartment for a while, and I said that\nwas fine. I had a literature class review session later, and I prepared my\nmaterial, thinking about Ma Fulai and other friends like Gao Ming. I doubted\nthat the problem was simply a lack of sexual freedom; rather it seemed that\nthere was just enough freedom to get the trouble started. Later there would be\nmore sexual freedom, but this might not do wonders for the people in Fuling,\neither. Often I found it hard to explain that certain things were complicated\nno matter where you lived.\nThe only honest advice I could ever think of was: Don’t get married. But\nthis wasn’t particularly realistic and it was easy for me to say; as a waiguoren\nthat was yet another way in which I was beyond the pale, because I wasn’t\ngoing to be married in Fuling. None of those issues touched me directly, and\nI watched from a distance, the way I did with so many other things. It was\nlike wandering through rich people’s apartments, or reading the stories my\nstudents wrote, or standing out on my balcony watching the Yangtze boats\nslip past to unknown destinations. There was a certain power to that, because\nmany things did not touch me, and from this distance there were moments—a\ntrip down the river, a day in the countryside—that stayed with me in all of\ntheir vividness and beauty. But often there was helplessness and sometimes\nthere was sadness. Sitting there with Ma Fulai, I knew that there would be\nsomething good about bringing this part of my life to a close. I watched him\nsmoke another cigarette, and then he left.\nTHAT SPRING was Beijing University’s hundredth anniversary, which\nnationwide celebrations combined with the seventy-ninth anniversary of the\nMay Fourth Movement. There was a television special in which Da Shan, the\nChinese-speaking Canadian, told jokes and introduced floor shows on a stage\nin the Beijing campus.\nThe May Fourth Movement had occurred in 1919, in response to the\nVersailles Treaty. This agreement rewarded Chinese contributions to the\nAllied victory by granting former German concessions like Qingdao to the\nJapanese—an injustice that naturally outraged the Chinese people. The\nmovement began as a student protest, expanding to include a wide range of\nreform-minded Chinese intellectuals. It was a nationalistic protest that",
        "simultaneously reached out to the West; “science” and “democracy” were its\ncatchwords.\nThe Communist Party claimed that the May Fourth Movement was a\npredecessor to its own uprising, which was a particularly brazen instance of\nappropriating history. Indeed, some of the May Fourth leaders were\nCommunist or eventually turned to Communism, but it was a stretch to link\ntheir ideals to the attitude of today’s Party. As a result, the television special\nwas a surreal mixture of contradictions: Communist Party officials praised\nthe memory of student activists; speeches extolled “science” and\n“democracy” and the Beijing University campus proudly commemorated the\nevents of 1919 while tactfully making no mention of what had happened\nthere in 1989. Da Shan told his usual jokes. In its own strange way the event\nmade for gripping television.\nFuling Teachers College joined in the celebration by staging a short play\ncompetition to mark the anniversary. Preliminary rounds took place in each\ndepartment, with the winners performing once more in the campus\nauditorium. One of my literature classes prepared some scenes from Romeo\nand Juliet, while the other class adapted Kate Chopin’s “Désirée’s Baby” for\nthe stage. Linda played Désirée and Mo Money was the heartless Armand; I\nhelped them practice, along with the Romeo and Juliet group.\nAdam’s Spanish class went to work on Don Quixote. That was a small\nclass—fewer than a dozen students total—and it included some of the\nliveliest third-year boys. They created their own version of Cervantes’s\nnovel, set in Fuling. Don Quixote became an East River noodle shop owner\nwho spent his spare time reading about the fine deeds of Lei Feng, the\nworker-martyr whose selfless dedication to Chairman Mao had made him a\npropaganda fixture since 1963. Lei Feng Spirit was a Communist-style\ncelebration of the banal: he had been a common soldier who showed no\ninterest in either fame or worldly possessions, preferring to labor in silent\nanonymity until the day a comrade accidentally backed a truck into a\nclothesline pole that fell on Lei Feng’s head and killed him (it took the driver\nanother twenty-five years before he was finally admitted into the Party).\nReform and Opening had put a damper on Lei Feng Spirit, although there\nwere a few echoes of the old days. Next to the Fuling stock exchange was a\nbuilding whose original propaganda message, long since removed, was still\nweather-stained clearly onto the white tile: “Study the Lei Feng Spirit.”",
        "March was officially Lei Feng Month, although most locals simply laughed if\nyou reminded them of this outdated tradition. But the college still took it\nseriously, assigning mandatory volunteer work to the students in honor of Lei\nFeng. In my second year, one of these March events was a cadre-led cleanup\nof the East River district, which consisted of a television crew filming college\nofficials and students as they pushed dirt to the other side of the street.\nThe East River cleanup took ten minutes, and Adam and I watched it\nfrom the Students’ Home noodle restaurant. It was a Friday afternoon and we\nwere eating Sichuan-style spaghetti and drinking local beer. A couple of our\nstudents came over and asked us to participate in the volunteer effort, so we\ncould be videotaped working alongside the cadres. The students seemed\ndisappointed when we declined.\n“We’re eating lunch,” Adam said, sipping his beer.\n“Anyway, we’re already doing volunteer work right now,” I said. “We’re\nPeace Corps volunteers.”\nThe scene wasn’t exactly Peace Corps brochure material, but it was\nimpossible for us to respond to Lei Feng Spirit with anything other than\ncynicism. The May Fourth anniversary felt much the same way, a shameless\nmanipulation of idealism, and probably these were the forces that gave birth\nto the Spanish class’s play of Don Quixote. But in the end it was impossible\nto tell exactly where the play came from, because Adam gave the students the\nbasic premise—that Don Quixote was an East River noodle shop owner who\nadmired Lei Feng—and from there the students took over, writing the\ndialogue and adding their own details.\nOn the day of the department competition, they were one of the last\ngroups to perform. The play began with Mo Money sitting in his noodle shop,\nreading a book. He stared intently at the pages and then shouted:\n“How wonderful! Look at all the fine deeds that Lei Feng does—every\nday he helps so many people! How I wish I could be like Lei Feng!”\nHe read another page; his eyes grew bigger. He stood up and began to\nmop his restaurant, thinking hard:\n“Why do I spend all of my time working like this? How boring my life is!\nWhat good is it to mop my poor noodle shop when I could be a great hero\nlike Lei Feng?”\nAnd then the idea hit him: he could travel across the countryside,\nperforming great deeds for the people. He turned his mop upside down,",
        "straddling it like a horse, and he put an old bucket on his head as a helmet.\nOn the wall of the noodle shop was a pinup of a Japanese xiaojie in a\nsundress (you could buy the pictures in downtown Fuling for half a yuan),\nand Mo Money looked at her in rapture:\n“My Dulcinea! I will travel everywhere until I find you!”\nHe turned the portrait into a banner and trotted off into the countryside.\nSoon he passed a peasant toiling in his fields, played by a boy named Roger.\n“Sancho Panza!” Mo Money shouted. “Would you like to come have\nadventures with me?”\nBut Sancho Panza kept working: “No, I have something to do!”\n“Aah, you are very tonto!” Don Quixote said. “Come have adventures\nwith me. We will go to fight injustice like Lei Feng, saving beautiful\nmaidens, and I will introduce you to my number one girl, Dulcinea! Come\non, don’t be a yahoo!”\n“You are the yahoo! I’m too busy to go with you.”\n“So tonto,” muttered Don Quixote. For a moment he stood there thinking\nabout what to offer the peasant. In the novel, Don Quixote promises that he’ll\ngive Sancho Panza the governorship of an island, and Adam had suggested\nthat the student play could use Hainan, the island province in the south of\nChina. But the students had their own ideas about Sancho Panza’s reward.\n“I must have a servant,” Mo Money said. “If you come with me, I will\npromise you…Taiwan Island! I will make you governor of Taiwan Island!”\nWith that, Sancho Panza grabbed a mop and the two of them rode off\ntogether, cantering in perfect time as the audience laughed. Mo Money and\nRoger were both talented actors, and there was an instant chemistry between\nthem. Roger was the quintessential sidekick, a skinny, wide-eyed boy who\nweighed perhaps ninety pounds and listened intently to the Don’s commands.\nAnd Mo Money seemed to have taken lessons from The Great Dictator,\nshouting instructions and carrying an air of mock seriousness.\nTogether they bumbled through the Sichuan countryside, attacking\nwindmills, fighting tigers, and causing trouble in rural inns. At one point they\nstopped to rest and Don Quixote commanded his servant to compose a song\nto Dulcinea. Sancho Panza took his guitar and sang under the Japanese pinup:\nDulcinea!",
        "Dulcineeeeeeeaaaa!\nYou are so beautiful…\nWhere is my island?\nMy Taiwan Island…\nBy the time they reached Chongqing, the people had already heard about\ntheir exploits. The Chongqing mayor, played by Lewis, presented them with\nhonorary toothbrushes, secretly pasting signs on their backs that said\n“Tonto,” “Yahoo,” and “Yashua” (toothbrush). The heroes proudly hung the\ntoothbrushes around their necks, and Don Quixote puffed out his chest and\nshouted:\n“I dedicate all of my good deeds to the beautiful Dulcinea! And I hope\nthat everybody begins to do great things like Lei Feng!”\nBy now the student audience was in hysterics. Even the department\nteachers, who sat in the front row as judges for the competition, were\nlaughing helplessly; and the crowd’s energy fed the actors, driving them to\ndash madly across the stage from one adventure to the next. There was no\nquestion that it was by far the best play in the department—but also there was\nno question that the play was treading on risky political ground. Part of the\naudience reaction seemed to say: I can’t believe I’m hearing this. To some\ndegree I felt the same way, and at the end of the performance I found myself\nwatching Party Secretary Zhang. It was hard to tell what he was thinking—he\nwas smiling and laughing softly, but I could see the wheels turning in his\nhead. And in the end he represented the only judge who really mattered.\nIT TOOK THE DEPARTMENT authorities a day to react. They banned\nDon Quixote; five other plays were chosen to be performed in the campus\nauditorium, including “Désirée’s Baby.” There were never any appeals to\ndecisions like this, and the department made it clear that political issues were\ninvolved.\nBut for some reason the students, who usually kept their grumbling quiet,\nwere openly angry. Even the ones who had produced Romeo and Juliet\nmuttered darkly that their play had also been denied for political reasons,",
        "because the title actors were real-life boyfriend and girlfriend, which was\nagainst the college’s anti-romance regulation (the most ignored rule on\ncampus). The strongest reaction, though, was from the Spanish students, who\nrefused to accept the department command. Mo Money angrily confronted\nthe department’s assistant political adviser, threatening that if Don Quixote\nwas blacklisted he would also pull out of “Désirée’s Baby.” Quickly it\nbecame a serious problem: the authorities didn’t want their competition to fall\napart, and they liked the politics of the Kate Chopin story, which criticized\nAmerican racism.\nAnd so it went with the anniversary celebration of the May Fourth\nMovement. In many ways I felt the department, and by proxy the Party, got\nexactly what it deserved. If you tried to politicize everything, turning every\npiece of literature and every scrap of history to your purposes, then at a\ncertain point it was bound to blow up in your face. After two years I was sick\nof the countless anniversaries and commemorations; I was tired of the twisted\nhistory; and I had had enough of our propaganda-laced textbooks.\nBut at the same time, Adam felt guilty, and even though it wasn’t my\nclass I felt the same way, because there was no question that our influence\nhad led the students into trouble. If we hadn’t been there, they wouldn’t have\nbeen performing Don Quixote and “Désirée’s Baby” (and without our\ninfluence there certainly would not have been a Communist Party Member\nwith the English name Mo Money). It was different from the other parts of\nour lives, in which we watched Fuling from a distance. We had a direct effect\non these students, and we had always encouraged them to be open-minded,\nquestioning, and irreverent. Some of this had been intentional—the debates\nabout Robin Hood, the conversations in Chinese—but mostly it was a matter\nof our fundamental identity. We were waiguoren, and we didn’t have that\nvoice in the back of our minds that warned us when certain lines were being\ncrossed. We had lived in Fuling long enough to affect some of the people, but\nnot long enough to internalize all of the rules; and this transitional state, like\nthe half-baked history of the May Fourth anniversary, led to risky politics.\nIt also seemed clear that even though the play had dealt with subjects that\nusually weren’t associated with laughter, the students hadn’t intended to be\nsubversive in any serious way. Mo Money, after all, was both a Party\nMember and the class monitor, and any violation had simply been the result\nof everybody’s losing track of the play as a whole. The subject matter came",
        "from too many directions at once: Adam had proposed the references to Lei\nFeng, and the students had come up with Taiwan, and all of the silly words\nthat they loved had come from many contexts over the course of the year.\nProbably their biggest mistake was focusing too much on Don Quixote Spirit.\nThey tried to be faithful to Cervantes’s novel, applying its satirical bent to\nFuling life, and they attempted to be as entertaining as possible. But both\nsatire and entertainment were risky endeavors in a Communist system, which\ndepends on the sort of control that ruins good comedy.\nMostly there was something disappointing about the pettiness. None of it\nhad any larger significance beyond whatever knowledge the students were\nable to acquire in their enthusiasm, and a counterrevolution was not going to\nstart with Don Quixote (although, by coincidence, some of the important\ndissident meetings of 1989 had taken place under Beijing University’s statue\nof Cervantes). But in any case it seemed clear that if Communist China was\ngoing to crumble, the collapse was not going to begin here in Fuling with a\ngroup of peasant-students clowning around on mops. It was pathetic that\nsomebody couldn’t watch the play and simply laugh; it was unquestionably\nfunny, but even intelligent, well-educated people like Party Secretary Zhang\nwere always listening to that voice in the back of their minds: Should I laugh\nat this? Is it really funny? Or is it offensive and dangerous? In some ways this\nwas what I had grown to loathe the most about Communism. I could almost\nbear the falseness and the lies, but I could not forgive its complete absence of\nhumor. China was a grim place once you took the laughter away.\nAdam and I encouraged Mo Money and the other students to work things\nout without causing more problems, but other than that we weren’t involved\nin the negotiations. As the week passed and the students gave us regular\nreports on these meetings, I began to see why the Don had struck such a\nchord. He was the perfect Chinese character, the poor knight with his\noutdated ideals and heart of gold. I saw flashes of him in everybody involved:\nhe was Mo Money and his hopeless play, but at the same time he was also\nParty Secretary Zhang and his hopeless political faith. When I thought about\nit, Party Secretary Zhang was just doing whatever he could to hold the line,\njust as others had held it before him, and probably he didn’t enjoy this\nparticular aspect of his job. Earlier in the semester his daughter had died and\nhis wife had just given birth to a son; he had bigger issues to worry about, but\nregulating the students’ politics was his job, and so he did it. Everybody was",
        "tilting at windmills and I really couldn’t blame any of them.\nAfter a few days they made a compromise. There would be a special final\nperformance of Don Quixote, strictly for the English department, with all of\nthe politically sensitive material vetted and purged. This satisfied everybody\n—“Désirée’s Baby” would continue as planned, and the Spanish class would\nget a final chance to perform in front of their friends, although they weren’t\nallowed to appear in the campus auditorium. Once again Adam helped them\npractice and rework the script.\nAt the end of the week, all of us gathered to watch the second\nperformance of Don Quixote. In some ways the play was a letdown; it lacked\nthe energy of the original, and a few times the actors became nervous,\nstumbling over their lines. The problem wasn’t so much that important\nmaterial had been lost, but rather that too much had been added: the play had\nacquired incredible symbolic weight in the course of a week. During the first\nstaging, nobody had thought too much about what it meant to refer to Lei\nFeng and Taiwan. Now some of the looseness that makes good comedy was\nlost; the banned references were conspicuous by their absence, and the\nstudents were worn out from a week of negotiating with the authorities.\nBut nothing could completely ruin the slapstick of the two heroes, and\nonce again the crowd enjoyed it. The play ended in mock sadness, the duo\nseparated by Don Quixote’s decision to retire to his noodle restaurant. Mo\nMoney rode his mop slowly home, hanging his head, while the theme song\nfrom Titanic played mournfully in the background.\nWilliam Jefferson Foster was the play’s narrator, and after the final scene\nhe stood up to read the postscript. But as he spoke, Adam and I realized that\nhe was departing from the prepared text, reading something that he had\nwritten himself. He was always heading off on his own like this; often in\nclass I’d see William Jefferson Foster with his nose buried in the dictionary,\nand then during the ten-minute break he’d sidle up to me and say, with\ncareful pronunciation, “How is your premature ejaculation?”\nMuch of his extracurricular studies was along these lines, and he was\nalways trying out some new obscenity or perverted phrase. It was childish,\nbut at the same time he was one of the best students in the class, and I could\nsee that much of his English skill came from the pleasure he gained from\nmanipulating the language. He took English in his own direction, using it as\nhe pleased, and I liked that. I also liked that he had grown up in a poor",
        "peasant home not far from Guang’an, Deng Xiaoping’s hometown, and yet\nnow he had given himself a ludicrously pretentious WASP name.\nAt the end of Don Quixote, William Jefferson Foster veered off on his\nown once more. Standing there in front of the department he read his own\nconclusion:\nDon went back to his noodle shop, and Sancho went back to his farm\nto raise hogs in order to support his tuition, hoping that he could get the\ndegree in Oxford University. Meanwhile Don taught himself and got the\nbachelor’s degree in Penn University. Later the two crazy men travelled\nto China and became two English teachers, also the most famous\nYahoos in Fuling.\nHe spoke quickly and none of the cadres caught it. Afterward he looked\nup at Adam and me, to see if we had understood, and then he grinned. The\nplay was over.\nTHE NEXT MORNING, Adam and I woke up early to do some filming\ndowntown. For three days we had had access to a video camera, because the\nPeace Corps medical officer was making a site visit and she had brought the\noffice film equipment. It was the first time anybody from the Peace Corps\nstaff had come to Fuling since the week we arrived in the city.\nFor three days we tried to capture everything about Fuling that we wanted\nto remember. We filmed the students’ performance of Don Quixote, and we\nmade trips to the countryside and the parts of old town that we liked. Much of\nthe tape consisted of short conversations with friends: the family at the\nStudents’ Home, the priest, the people who worked in the restaurants,\nteahouses, and parks where we had spent so much time. We took a cab ride\nand asked the driver to go as fast as possible while I pointed the camera out\nthe window, filming the traffic as it flashed past in a chorus of honks.\nOn the morning that the Peace Corps medical officer was leaving, we\ndecided to do one final shooting before returning the camera. We were\ndowntown by seven o’clock, filming a group of elderly people as they did",
        "their taiji routines in South Mountain Gate Park, and then we took the\nstaircases down toward the docks so we could get some typical street scenes.\nIt was difficult to film average street life because it always stopped the\nmoment we arrived. The camera was bulky, an expensive model that was\nessentially the same size as what a television reporter might use, and crowds\nalways gathered and stared. Apart from conversations with friends, much of\nour Fuling footage consisted of locals and stick-stick soldiers gaping at the\ncamera.\nDown near the docks I quickly found myself surrounded by a crowd.\nNeither Adam nor I had spent much time in this area; there were no teahouses\nor restaurants where we knew the workers. Many of the people who gathered\nhadn’t seen us before, and we told them that we were local teachers who were\nfilming as a hobby.\nAdam decided to create a diversion. He drifted a few feet down the street,\nstopping to buy a steamed bun from a streetside vendor. They bargained for a\nwhile and the crowd started to shift, and then Adam joked with the woman\nand she laughed, covering her mouth. Slowly I started to move backward,\nhoping to separate myself from the crowd. Twenty people gathered around\nAdam, then thirty, forty. A few cabs stopped to stare; traffic backed up.\nHorns honked. I crossed the street quickly and then I was alone, filming\nAdam in the center of the crowd. Everybody had forgotten that I was there.\nIt was the sort of scene that at one point had been terrifying—there was\nnothing more intimidating during the first year than standing in the center of\na mass of people, all of them studying me with incredible intensity. But rarely\nwere these groups anything but curious, and over time, like the other\nwaiguoren who lived in rural Sichuan cities, Adam and I learned how to\nwork the crowds. I always smiled and stayed relaxed, usually focusing on a\nsingle bystander: he would ask questions and I would answer while the rest of\nthe people listened. Usually I told them my salary, and what I did in Fuling,\nand I answered their questions about America. To make the crowd laugh, I\ncould use the dialect or refer to myself as a foreign devil. It was like being a\npolitician in a benevolent environment, handling a press conference at which\nthe theme was simply curiosity.\nThere was a certain power to those moments, because it was a remarkable\nthing to hold the attention of forty people who had dropped whatever they\nwere doing simply to see you. This morning the crowd continued to swell",
        "around Adam. More than fifty people gathered close, laughing at his jokes.\nHe offered a bun to a passing cab. He bought two more buns from the woman\nand began to juggle. Another battalion of stick-stick soldiers rushed across\nthe street to join the spectators. I zoomed in with the camera, focusing on\nfaces—the smiling bun vendor, the young shopkeepers who had come out\ninto the street, the worn visages of the stick-stick soldiers, their faces broken\ninto grins as they watched the waiguoren.\nAdam dropped a bun. He picked it up and tossed it across the street\ntoward me. He pointed me out, and the people laughed, turning back to Adam\nas he told another joke. Slowly I panned across the faces once more, and then\nsuddenly the viewfinder went black.\nSomething pushed me backward and I took a step to regain my balance. I\nstill had my eye on the viewfinder and it went black once more, and this time\nI was pushed back harder. I looked up and a man was standing in front of me,\nwaving his leather money bag.\n“You can’t do this,” he said. “You can’t film here.”\n“Who are you?” I asked.\nHe repeated his command, and I repeated my question. I was still filming,\nthe camera on my shoulder.\n“I’m a citizen,” he said. “You can’t do this. It’s illegal.”\nHe swung his bag once more, harder this time, and I felt my anger rise.\n“Stop hitting the camera,” I said. “Who are you?”\n“I’m a citizen,” he said again. He had a thick local accent and he stepped\nclose, threateningly. He was a big man with a belly and a shock of greasy hair\nand a round face that shone with anger. There were certain things about him\nthat I recognized immediately—from his accent I knew that he wasn’t\neducated, and something in the way he dressed and carried himself told me\nthat he had a position of some authority, perhaps as a minor government\ncadre or a lower-level factory boss. He was in his late forties—of that age\ngroup known as the “Lost Generation,” because they had grown up during the\nCultural Revolution.\n“I’m a citizen,” he said once more.\n“I’m a citizen, too,” I said. “I live here in Fuling. I teach at the teachers\ncollege. There’s nothing illegal about filming here.”\nHe swung again at the camera, hitting it. I stepped forward.\n“Leave me alone,” I said. “I’m not doing anything wrong. Get out of",
        "here. Blow away.”\nThe last phrase caught him. His eyes widened.\n“What did you say?”\n“I told you to blow away,” I said. “Who do you think you are? You can’t\njust come up and hit somebody for no reason at all. Why do you have to be so\nrude?”\nI used the harsh word for rudeness, culu, and again it caught him.\n“You can’t film here,” he shouted. “You’re not teachers—you’re\nreporters. And you can’t throw things on the street like he just did. You\nshould show more respect, and you shouldn’t be here.”\n“I’ve been here for two years,” I said. “We’re just teachers, and we’re\nfilming because we want to remember Fuling. You shouldn’t be so rude.”\nBy now a crowd was gathering around us, murmuring, pressing close. A\nwoman was with the man and she began to shout at me, jabbing her finger in\nthe air. I was still filming but I held the camera low against my side. Adam\nhurried over from the other side of the street, trying to explain that we were\nteachers. But by now the woman and the man were shouting angrily, and the\ncrowd’s murmurs were growing louder, and I realized that we were in\ntrouble. Nobody was smiling anymore. I turned the camera off. The crowd\ngrew.\nOF EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENED during my two years in Fuling, I\nreviewed that incident the most times. It couldn’t be avoided; that was one of\nthe most troubling moments I ever had in the city, and it was on tape.\nI did not enjoy watching the video. Every time I saw it, something tensed\nin my stomach and I could feel my pulse race. I watched the smiling faces as\nAdam juggled and joked around, and I told myself that the people were\nobviously happy. I thought about all the days I had spent in the city, all the\ncrowds I had encountered, and all the times nothing had happened. And I\nremembered the incident when the shoeshine man had bothered me and the\npeople had stood up in my defense.\nBut always when I watched the video I silently urged it forward, waiting\nfor the man to appear on the screen. He came in from the left, long after\nAdam had drawn the crowd, but unlike the others the man and his wife stood",
        "apart, a few feet away from the pack. They watched Adam for half a minute,\nand then the man turned to look at me. He crossed the street and walked\ntoward me, striding purposefully off the side of the screen, and then suddenly\neverything went black.\nThere was much that the video showed. Most painfully, it showed the\nmistakes that we had made, starting with drawing a crowd in a part of town\nthat we didn’t know well. It also showed that Adam had been too nonchalant,\nmilking the attention, and it showed that he had been disrespectful in tossing\nthe bun across the street. It showed that I was far too quick to anger and use\nstrong language; from the tape it seemed that the man might have left me\nalone if I hadn’t insulted him.\nBut at the same time there was much missing from the tape, which was\nprobably what made it the most unpleasant to watch. None of the background\nwas there—nothing could show how we had dealt with so many crowds in\nthe past that we were overconfident, and nothing could explain that\nconfidence and looseness were the best ways to deal with that aspect of life in\nFuling. The worst reaction was to fear the crowds or wish that they wouldn’t\nappear; you had to accept that you were an anomaly, and that people were\ngoing to gather to stare and listen to you talk. If you let this bother you, it\nwould make you miserable, the same way that there was no point in worrying\nabout the noise and the pollution.\nAnd always the key was to avoid taking yourself seriously. To be\nsuccessful you laughed at yourself, talking of “us foreign devils,” and you\nmade a sloppy and hilarious imitation of the dialect. If you felt an urge to\njuggle, you juggled. It was like something that Adam used to say before he\nwent into town to practice Chinese: “Well, now it’s time to be a buffoon for\nthe next two hours.”\nThe tape also said nothing about all of the baggage that accompanied a\nwaiguoren holding a camera in China. In 1972, when there were virtually no\nforeigners in the country, Zhou Enlai invited the Italian filmmaker\nMichelangelo Antonioni to make a documentary about China. It was a\ncontroversial invitation; Mao’s wife, Jiang Qing, and other conservatives in\nthe government opposed it, but Zhou believed that a Westerner could make a\nfilm about China that would appeal to the outside world. Antonioni was\nsympathetic to the Chinese government, but his final product enraged\nofficials, who accused him of deliberately trying to make China look poor.",
        "Most famously, Jiang Qing pointed out that his shot of the Nanjing Bridge\nincluded a workers’ laundry line in the foreground.\nThis was precisely what the Chinese expected of a foreigner—only a\nwaiguoren would visit a modern bridge and come away with the image of a\nclothesline, making the country look poor. Although Antonioni denied\nstrenuously that his intentions had been to criticize China, a 1974 propaganda\ncampaign focused on the incident, turning it into a textbook example of the\nway waiguoren came to China and searched for the negative aspects. I had\nmet older people in Sichuan and Xi’an who were familiar with this story, and\nas a result I had learned to be careful with my camera in Fuling. More than\nonce somebody had accused me of trying to show the bad side of local life.\nBut all of our experience failed Adam and me while we videotaped. The\ncamera showed our mistakes with an embarrassing clarity, but it didn’t show\neverything that happened before the man confronted me, and it didn’t show\nwhat happened after I turned the camera off. And perhaps what bothered me\nthe most was that I watched the tape more than a dozen times, but never\ncould I tell the precise moment when the crowd turned against us. I had\nalways been fascinated by that elusive but definite shift, the quicksilver\ninstant when a Fuling crowd became a mob, but in the end it remained a\nmystery. Even the camera couldn’t capture it.\nTHE MOB GREW. I turned the camera off. Adam was at my side and both\nof us were trying to explain at once. The man and his wife were still at the\nheart of the mob, and I could hear the man saying over and over that we were\nreporters who had no respect for the city. But by now he wasn’t the only one\ntalking. Others pressed forward, shouting and gesturing angrily, and it was\nhard to understand what they were saying. The buzz of the mob rose, shifting\ninto a roar.\nI felt my anger turn to fear, and now Adam and I were trying to be\nconciliatory, apologizing and emphasizing that we were teachers who meant\nno harm. But it was too late for explanations; nobody was listening and\nbystanders were jostling in their effort to see what was happening. Somebody\nbrushed against my back. I wrapped both hands around the camera and held it\nin front of me. More people were shouting, their faces hard with anger.",
        "“We need to get the hell out of here,” I said to Adam. I started to leave,\ndropping my head and holding the camera carefully, but nobody budged. The\nman’s wife stood directly in front of me. I felt somebody clutching at my\narm.\n“We’re leaving,” I said in Chinese. The woman made no reply. She didn’t\nmove and now there was a horrible smile on her face—a combination of\nanger and joy as she saw us get what we deserved.\n“Jesus,” I said. “They won’t let me out.”\n“Follow me,” Adam said. He was carrying the camera case, an enormous\nmetal box, and now he held it before him. Hands grabbed at him, but he\nshook them off and kept walking, his size and the bulk of the box forcing the\nmob to give way. Somebody tore at my arm. I cradled the camera as I pressed\nclose to Adam’s back. I felt a kick glance off my leg, and then another blow\nstruck me hard on the thigh. We were free of the mob now, starting to run,\nand I turned quickly to see who had kicked me. But all I saw was a pack of\nblurred faces. We hurried down the street. I didn’t look back again.\nNOTHING HAPPENED AS A RESULT of the incident. Somebody called\nthe college to report the confrontation, and the college waiban called the\nPeace Corps. The waiban said nothing about whether Adam and I had been in\nthe wrong; they simply asked if the camera was all right, and the Peace Corps\nsaid there were no problems. We had told the medical officer about the\nincident before she left Fuling.\nAdam and I talked about it with Noreen and Sunni, but we didn’t tell\nanybody else in Fuling. Together we watched the tape a lot. Nearly all of the\nfootage consisted of pleasant everyday scenes—the rivers and the\ncountryside; our students and our friends—but mostly we watched the part\nwith the crowd. It was as if we were looking for some insight that we could\ntake away from the experience, something that would explain the\nunpleasantness, but there were no neat revelations. All it showed was a blunt\nuseless truth about life on the streets of Fuling: after two years we were still\nwaiguoren, both in the way we acted and in the way the people saw us.\nThere was nothing to do about that now, and we recovered as best we\ncould. Fortunately we left town for a few days, because there were some",
        "Peace Corps administrative matters to take care of in Chengdu, and after\nreturning to Fuling I tried not to think too much about the incident. In some\nways avoiding the memory wasn’t as hard as I had expected, because already\nthere were many things like that in the river town. You knew they were there,\nbut you tried not to think about them too much.\nI went to town during the evenings, just as I always had. I still felt\ncomfortable when people pressed close to see me, and the people were still\nfriendly. Nothing had changed. It was both comforting and disheartening to\nrealize that in some ways things were the same as they always had been.\nJUNE WAS A BUSY MONTH, and I tried to start the goodbyes early, so\nthere wouldn’t be such a rush at the end.\nQian Manli and Wang Dongmei were two young women from the local\nBank of China who had always been particularly helpful, so Adam and I\nasked them out for hot pot on a Friday night. It was the first date of any sort\nI’d had in two years of living in Fuling.\nWe met them on Gaosuntang. Both of them had dressed carefully—very\nshort skirts, very bright makeup, silk blouses, highlights in their hair. We\nhadn’t expected that; Adam and I were wearing T-shirts and baseball caps.\nThe best hot pot places were on Xinghua Road, winding down toward the\ncenter of town, and the four of us walked past the open-air restaurants that\nlined the sidewalk. It was a warm night, with hundreds of people eating\noutside, and all of them stared as we walked past. Qian Manli and Wang\nDongmei were very pretty women in their mid-twenties, and it was clear that\nthey enjoyed the attention of going out with the waiguoren—in fact, this\nappeared to be why they had prepared themselves so elaborately.\nWe chose a restaurant and took a table on the sidewalk. There was a hush\nas we arrived. The women ordered for us, and Adam and I started one of our\nChinese routines, referring to each other as foreign devils, running dogs, and\nCapitalist Roaders. Wang Dongmei and Qian Manli laughed, as everybody\nalways did when we peppered our conversation with Cultural Revolution\ninsults and anti-foreigner remarks. We ordered local beer and it was nice to\neat on the sidewalk, chatting and watching the crowd.\nThe incident with the video camera seemed far away, and I realized that",
        "one thing I would never forget about Fuling was its unpredictability—the\nway things could change so quickly, a bad day followed by a good week. The\ntown wasn’t simple, and neither was my role there; it would be wrong to say\nthat I had failed in my efforts to make Fuling a comfortable home, and it\nwould be just as inaccurate to claim that I had been entirely successful. There\nwere good days and there were bad days. To some degree this was what I\nliked most about Fuling: it was a human place, brightened by decency and\nscarred by flaws, and a town like that was always engaging. For two years I\nhad never been bored.\nToday was one of the good days, and sitting there at the hot pot restaurant\nI felt completely comfortable with everything, the language and the crowd\nand the women at our table. It wasn’t much different from a Friday night at\nhome, hanging out with friends and joking around. And I liked the fact that\nAdam and I were also comfortable with each other’s Chinese personalities—\nHo Wei and Mei Zhiyuan were just as close as our other identities. It seemed\nages since our first semester, when we had avoided going into town together\nbecause it doubled the harassment.\nAfter an hour I got up to use the bathroom, and I returned to find Adam\nand Wang Dongmei talking loudly.\n“You’re not married!” Adam said.\n“Yes, I am,” she said, laughing. “I was married two months ago.”\n“You’re joking!”\n“No, it’s true.”\n“But you never said anything about getting married!”\n“You didn’t ask.”\n“You can’t be serious—you’re lying to me.”\nBut she seemed sincere. I turned to Qian Manli. “Are you married?”\n“Yes.”\n“I don’t believe it!”\n“It’s true,” she said, smiling. She had a nice smile and very pretty black\neyes, and I realized that in Fuling a woman like this would never make it past\ntwenty-five without marrying. I had been a fool for ever thinking otherwise.\n“Where’s your husband?” I asked.\n“He’s at home.”\n“What’s he doing?”\n“I don’t know. Probably watching television.”",
        "It was the same way with Wang Dongmei. Both of them were newlyweds\nwho had left their husbands at home on a Friday night to go out with the\nwaiguoren.\nI glanced over at Adam. At the beginning of the evening we had\npromised the women that we wouldn’t speak any English, but now we didn’t\nneed to; each of us knew what the other was thinking. Regardless of how\ncomfortable certain moments were in the city, life still wasn’t normal, and\nnever would be. That had always been part of Fuling’s charm and there was\nno reason to be surprised by it now.\nWe stayed for another two hours. The best aspect of eating hot pot was\nthat it took so long—it was a slow, lazy meal, perfect for a warm night out on\nthe sidewalk. The restaurant had cold beer and we ordered a few. Everybody\nhad a good time. After dinner we walked the women back to their apartment\nbuildings. I was hoping that they would invite us inside, so we could meet\ntheir husbands—sort of like meeting a girl’s parents when you went out in\nhigh school. But they just smiled and waved goodbye, and we caught a cab\nback to the college.\nTEACHER LIAO WAS PREGNANT; she was due in July. In June she\ninvited Adam and me to a farewell dinner. She gave us some calligraphy that\nhad been written by her father-in-law, who was famous for his brushwork,\nand we gave her some baby clothes.\nA couple of evenings earlier, the college authorities had invited all four of\nthe foreign teachers and our tutors to a banquet. Mr. Wang, the waiban\nrepresentative, had always enjoyed making fun of Adam’s and my Chinese,\nspeaking with patronizing slowness and accusing us of not understanding. He\nsat at my table during the banquet, mocking me mercilessly, until finally\nTeacher Liao snapped at him.\n“Ho Wei understands what you’re saying!” she said. “We studied that a\nyear ago. You don’t need to talk to him like that!”\nMr. Wang laughed lightly, as he always did; but the point had been made,\nand I took great pleasure in watching this tiny pregnant woman set the cadre\nstraight. It reminded me of the way she had defended Li Peng during our\ntutorial a year ago—it was the same fierce pride, and, despite being indirectly",
        "linked with Li Peng, I was happy to share in her loyalty.\nShe knew that I didn’t like Mr. Wang because that spring I had been very\nopen with her about my feelings regarding the waiban and the English\ndepartment. Teacher Liao’s final assignment had been to summarize my\nexperience in Fuling, and I spent our last two classes doing that. I was blunt\n—I told her about the things I didn’t like, the administration’s pettiness and\nthe mocking catcalls in town, and never once did she try to defend any of it.\nBut I spent most of the time talking about the good things that had happened\nin Fuling, and I said that by far my best experience had been learning Chinese\nand meeting people in the city. I told her that in particular I respected the way\nthat she and Teacher Kong had extended their friendship as well as their\npatience; others wouldn’t have done the same.\nThose classes ended in May, because of her pregnancy. My office was on\nthe sixth floor of the teaching building, and I strongly recommended that for\nour final tutorials we meet in her apartment, or someplace else that was more\nconvenient. She was not a physically strong woman, and it tired her to climb\nall the way up to my office.\nBut until the end she was very Chinese—it was appropriate for us to meet\nin my office, and so that was where we had class. This had nothing to do with\nstairs or pregnancy; it was simply how things were done. It was the Chinese\nway.\nIn early May we had my last tutorial. She struggled up the steps, gasping\nfor breath, and I gave her a couple of minutes to recover. As was true of so\nmany Chinese women, most of her body remained thin throughout the\npregnancy—it was as if somebody had sewn an awkward bundle onto her\nstomach. Finally she stopped wheezing and we began class.\nAfter thirty minutes she suddenly sat bolt upright, puffed out her cheeks,\nand rushed out the door. I could hear her getting sick in the spittoon outside\nmy office, and then she hurried down the hallway to the bathroom.\nI waited for her to return. A year ago, I would have assumed that she\nwould cancel class, but now I knew better—we would finish the two hours\ntoday. I knew exactly how she would act when she returned, and what she\nwould say. And I knew that I would always remember this woman’s quiet\npride and toughness, and the way it had gone from being infuriating to\nsomething whose consistency was admirable and even comforting.\nFive minutes later she came back. She smiled, blushed, and said,",
        "“Duibuqi. Sorry.”\n“Do you want to stop class?” I asked.\n“No. It is nothing—often at this time in the morning I am a little sick.”\n“Certainly we don’t have to finish today if you feel poorly.”\n“It is nothing,” she said firmly. “Now—please continue with what you\nwere saying before I left.”\nAnd I did.\nI HAD MADE SOME MONEY from a story I had written for the Los\nAngeles Times, and I donated the payment to the Fuling Catholic church. I\nknew that Father Li had been looking for some extra cash so he could have a\nmural painted on a new wall in the courtyard, and he thanked me when I\nmade the donation.\n“Thank you for your kindness to me,” I said, shaking the old man’s hand.\nWe were sitting in his office, with the poster of Mao and Deng on the wall.\nFather Li gripped my hand tightly.\n“We’ll remember you after you’re gone,” he said. “I’ll say a Mass for\nyou.”\n“Thank you,” I said, and then I thought of something. “Could you also\nsay a Mass for my grandfather?”\n“Certainly. Write his name here.”\nHe handed me a piece of paper and I wrote my grandfather’s name: Frank\nAnselm Dietz. Anselm was the holy name that he had chosen when he\nbecame a Benedictine monk. I wrote it carefully and gave the paper back to\nthe priest.\n“When my grandfather was young, he was a monk in Rome,” I said. “He\nwanted to come here to China.” I had told Father Li this before, but for some\nreason it seemed important that I repeat it now.\n“Rome is a very beautiful city,” said the priest.\n“Yes, it is,” I said. “I’ve been there before.”\n“I’ve never gone,” he said, chuckling to himself.\n“My grandfather didn’t become a priest. But I think he would like it very\nmuch if you said a Mass for him here in Fuling.”\n“I’ll do that,” Father Li said, nodding.",
        "“Thank you very much,” I said. “I’ll come back sometime and see the\nnew wall.”\n“You will always be welcome here.”\nHe walked with me into the courtyard, where high walls kept out the\nnoise of the city. Flowers were growing around the Four Modernizations\nsign. It was a hot afternoon. I was thinking about my grandfather and the old\npriest, and suddenly I was so sad that I couldn’t say anything else. Silently I\nshook his hand and turned to leave.\n“Manman zou,” he said. “Go slowly.” But I walked quickly out of the\ncourtyard and into the roar of the city.\nI GAVE THE LITERATURE STUDENTS their final examination during\nthe last week. Linda’s father was very sick now, and she took the test a few\nhours early so she could catch a noon bus home. I offered to let her take it\nlater, or not at all; she had always been one of the best students and the news\nabout her father had not sounded good. But she insisted on taking the test\nbefore leaving Fuling.\nLater that afternoon I supervised the rest of the students during the\nscheduled exam. As always, they were nervous and worked seriously,\nalthough I noticed that one girl, Susan, seemed distracted. She was very pale\nand spent most of the second hour with her head on the desk.\nI didn’t think much of it until later. It was Adam’s birthday and after the\nexam we had a banquet for all the students at a local restaurant. Everybody\ndrank too much and it was a good night, spilling over to the Students’ Home,\nwhere Feng Xiaoqin served us more beer.\nAt some point during the evening, Mo Money told me that Linda’s father\nhad died while she was taking my examination. The fortune-tellers had been\nright; and now I wished that I had insisted she take the test some other time.\nThe following day Susan disappeared from the college. The story came\nout gradually, in bits and pieces. Four days earlier she had had an abortion,\nand the night before the examination she had been taken to the emergency\nroom because of complications. Somehow it had been kept secret up to that\npoint; my impression was that she had found some sort of illegal private\ndoctor, although this wasn’t clear. All we knew for certain was that her",
        "emergency-room trip had alerted the college authorities, and now they knew\nthe truth, which was why she had left. Students were expelled whenever they\nwere caught having sexual relations, not to mention getting pregnant. And a\nnote was attached to their dangan—the dossiers that followed them wherever\nthey went in China. If Susan ever took a danwei job of any sort, her superiors\nwould know what had happened to her.\nGroups of girl students talked quietly in the hallways, their faces drawn.\nThe night after Susan left, I ran into Sarah and Lisa outside my office. They\nwere serious and we spoke in Chinese, standing on the landing overlooking\nthe city. I asked about Susan, and Lisa looked at me carefully.\n“Do you know what happened to her?” she said.\n“Yes.”\n“How do you know?”\n“Other students have told me.”\n“What do you think about it?”\n“I think it’s very sad, of course. And I think she should be allowed to\ngraduate.”\n“That won’t happen,” Lisa said quickly. She was one of the better\nstudents and also one of the more thoughtful. I asked her if Susan had gone\nhome, and Lisa shook her head.\n“She can’t go home,” she said. “Her father is very angry.”\n“How does he know?”\n“The college told him. When the authorities found out, at first they\nagreed not to tell her family. But for some reason they told. This same thing\nhappened to Susan’s older sister a few years ago, and when her father found\nout he beat her. So now Susan will not go home. Her father is very angry—\nit’s a big loss of face for the family. This is the second time they have lost\nface in such a way.”\n“Do you think the department should have told him?” I asked.\n“I don’t think it’s their affair. It’s a private matter.”\nI told her that I agreed, and I asked how Susan’s boyfriend was treating\nher.\n“He is fine. She has good guanxi with his parents and I think they will\nhelp her. Perhaps that is where she has gone. But you know, she paid several\nthousand yuan to get a teaching job in his hometown, but now she won’t\ngraduate and she’ll lose the job. She’ll lose the money, too.”",
        "That didn’t seem to be the biggest concern—to be honest, I was far more\nworried about Susan jumping off a bridge. But I said nothing about that.\n“This sort of thing happens everywhere,” I said. “In America it’s very\ncommon as well.”\n“What do people do about the problem there?”\n“It’s very difficult, just as it is here, but usually it can be kept private.\nProbably that is the biggest difference.”\n“That’s the way it should be. But here everybody knows—the whole\ncollege has heard about it.”\n“What do most people think?”\n“A few people think it’s funny; others think she’s a bad woman. But most\nof the students in our class are very sorry for Susan, although we can’t help.”\nShe shook her head and gazed out on the rivers. “Mei banfa,” she said.\n“There is nothing that can be done.”\nTHE NEXT DAY I turned twenty-nine years old. Always in the past my\nbirthdays had felt like somebody else’s—it seemed impossible that I had\nreally gained another year. But this time I knew that I was twenty-nine; in\nsome ways I felt much older. It had been a long two years and during that\ntime I hadn’t left western China.\nIn the morning I went with Adam and Mo Money to the bus station,\nbecause Linda had asked us to meet her when she returned. She wore a black\narmband and her eyes were red. After getting off the bus she tried to smile,\none of those brave Chinese smiles that held the emotion at bay, compressed\nand controlled and pushed to the peripheries—a corner of the mouth, a line\nacross the forehead. But today the sadness was too much; her mouth\ntrembled, and she looked away.\nThat evening I graded my literature examinations. I thought about how\npleasant everything had seemed when I monitored the exam, walking through\nthe rows of students with their heads down, working hard. I liked being\nsurrounded by their silence and concentration, and I liked the way that all of\nthe black-haired heads were bent seriously. There was a simplicity to the\nscene, and there was a similar simplicity to the examination, which had\nnothing to do with the complications of life in Fuling, or the political",
        "problems in China, or the nationwide struggle of Reform and Opening. It was\nsimply a literature test.\nFor the final section I asked them to analyze Robert Frost’s “Nothing\nGold Can Stay”:\nNature’s first green is gold,\nHer hardest hue to hold.\nHer early leaf’s a flower;\nBut only so an hour.\nThen leaf subsides to leaf.\nSo Eden sank to grief,\nSo dawn goes down to day.\nNothing gold can stay.\nWe had studied the poem back in May. I had lectured in detail about its\nrhythm—I always did that, because the students liked analyzing the sound of\nthe language and you could take a poem apart without boring them. Most of\nthem had understood what I said about Frost, and it was one of those classes\nthat made me feel good about teaching literature. During the exam I felt the\nsame way, walking through the rows and watching them work.\nBut now I realized that the simplicity had been a mirage. Linda’s father\nhad been dying as she took her final exam, and Susan had been struggling\nwith the fear that had now driven her from the college. That was the way so\nmany things in Fuling turned out—even teaching, which seemed to be a\nstraightforward job, was complex and uncertain. There was an unemotional\nveneer that the people presented to the outside world, especially to\nwaiguoren, and this made it harder when you lived there long enough to\ncatch a glimpse of the way things actually worked. Of course, to some degree\nit was just the difficulties of life anywhere in the world—during my time in\nFuling, two students had died; another student had an abortion and was\nexpelled; a father died; a child died; people’s marriages crumbled. Those\nthings happened everywhere. But in Fuling it had taken me longer to see that\nside of life, because at first as a waiguoren I was held at a distance, and in a\nway that distance was hardest to deal with once it was gone. It was like",
        "looking at a blank meaningless smile and suddenly recognizing a lifetime of\nsadness concentrated in the corner.\nI had never had any idealistic illusions about my Peace Corps “service” in\nChina; I wasn’t there to save anybody or leave an indelible mark on the town.\nIf anything, I was glad that during my two years in Fuling I hadn’t built\nanything, or organized anything, or made any great changes to the place. I\nhad been a teacher, and in my spare time I had tried to learn as much as\npossible about the city and its people. That was the extent of my work, and I\nwas comfortable with those roles and I recognized their limitations.\nBut now I found myself wondering if anything would be left from those\nhours in class. I hoped that my students would remember that Frost poem, or\nsomething else that we had studied. It could be something as small as a single\ncharacter from a story, or a sliver from a Shakespeare sonnet—but I hoped\nthat something would be remembered. I hoped that they would keep it\nsomewhere in the back of their minds, and that they would find something\nsteady and true in its simple beauty. This was the faith I had in literature: its\ntruth was constant, unaffected by the struggles of daily life. But at the same\ntime there was always the issue of relevance, and there were moments when a\npoem like “Nothing Gold Can Stay” seemed useless against the harsh\nrealities of a place like Fuling.\nI thought about that for a while, and then I went back to grading the\nexaminations. I didn’t have any answers; in the end I just had to hope for the\nbest. Most of them would be fine, I figured. Certainly Linda would be fine,\nand Mo Money would be fine, and William Jefferson Foster would be fine,\nand so would Anne, working down in Shenzhen. Most things in the city\nwould work out all right. The priest would be fine, and my tutors would be\nfine, and the family at the Students’ Home would be fine. Most of the people\nwould continue to make the best of things, and most of the children would\nhave better lives than their parents had. That was really all you could hope\nfor. Perhaps Susan would not be fine, but there was nothing to do about that,\njust as there hadn’t been much to do for Janelle and Rebecca and the others\nwho had lost their way. Mei banfa.\nA couple of days later, Jimmy gave me a cassette tape and asked if I\nwould make a recording of all the poetry we had studied. He was one of the\nliveliest boys, but he had never been a particularly good student; usually he\nsat in the back of the class and muttered “yahoo” and yashua whenever"

      "text": "that started with cursing and graduated to hair-pulling, growing increasingly\nviolent until finally they were screaming and tearing at each other’s clothes\nwhile a crowd gathered. The strange thing was that both of the women\nworked barbecue stands with men whom I assumed were their husbands or\nboyfriends, and yet these men stood by passively during the fight. They\nseemed embarrassed, or stunned; one of them kept his attention on the grill\nand fiddled with the coals as if nothing was happening. The other man simply\nwatched dumbly. At last Mr. Zhang stepped in and stopped the fight, but by\nthen the shirt of one of the women had been badly torn and she stood there in\nher bra, cursing and spitting, until finally somebody led her home. After she\nwas gone her husband stayed behind, quietly working his grill.\nThat sort of fight was unusual; most nights the regulars got along well\nand supported each other if there were difficulties. I liked this aspect of\nGaosuntang—there was a sense of community, with Mr. Zhang at the center,\nand by knowing him I came to meet the other vendors. One of them was a\nten-year-old shoeshine girl who had dropped out of elementary school\nbecause her family couldn’t afford the fees. I never knew how to react to that;\noften I had my shoes shined in town, and sometimes I figured that I might as\nwell give the girl my business. Other nights I decided that it was horrible to\nhave your shoes shined by a ten-year-old elementary school dropout, so I\nwent to somebody else instead. Like many aspects of my life in Fuling, it was\ninconsistent and I never could figure out what was the right thing to do.\nOne night near the end of the holiday I ordered five kebabs from Mr.\nZhang, who invited me to sit on his stool, as he always did. A few of the\nother vendors came over to chat, as well as a number of passersby who\nstopped to stare at the waiguoren.\nAfter a while the attention died down. I finished the kebabs and sat there\nreading the Chongqing Evening Times. I felt somebody come close, and then\nhe leaned forward and shouted “Hahh-lloooo!” in my face. He shouted as\nloudly as he could, and after that he laughed. I didn’t look up—there was no\nreason to acknowledge people like that.\nI felt him move away and I assumed that he had left; usually the people\nwho harassed me were best handled by being ignored. But a moment later he\nreturned, grabbing one of the sausages from Mr. Zhang’s barbecue stand. He\nshoved the sausage past my newspaper and into my face. “Chi! Chi! Chi!” he\nshouted. “Eat! Eat! Eat!”\n\nThere were two things in particular that could anger me quickly in Fuling.\nOne was any sort of physical violation—somebody shoving, or grabbing at\nme, or pushing past rudely. The other was when people treated me like an\nanimal, grunting or gesturing bluntly because they assumed that the\nwaiguoren was very slow and couldn’t speak Chinese. The man with the\nsausage had successfully touched both of these sensitivities at once, and my\ncustomary passivity disappeared immediately.\nI stood up quickly and knocked the sausage out of his hand. He was a\nsmall man in his late thirties, and he moved back, surprised. I stepped\nforward. “Why are you bothering me?” I asked. He stuttered, fumbling for\nwords. I took my hand and placed it even with the top of his head, and then I\ndrew it back, level. It came to my chin.\nYou are much smaller than me,” I said. “You should not bother people\nwho are bigger. Next time I’ll fix you.”\nHe took another step backward and I sat down again. The people around\nus had become quiet. For the first time I looked carefully at the man and saw\nthat he was trouble. There was a mean look in his eyes and clearly he was\npoor. He gathered himself to speak.\n“I have friends who are bigger than you,” he said.\n“I’d like to meet them,” I said.\n“They’re just up the street.”\n“Go get your friends,” I said. “I’ll stay here and wait for you. Go—blow\naway.” It was a common insult and a few of the people laughed. The little\nman didn’t move.\nHe said something else, angrily, which I didn’t understand. Mr. Zhang\ncame over, and I asked him if the man was his friend.\n“No,” said Mr. Zhang. “He shines shoes. He has no culture. You do not\nwant to bother with him.”\n“I wonder what kind of little thing he is,” I said. It was another common\ninsult in Sichuan, to ask a person what kind of thing he was. I should not\nhave been baiting him further but for some reason I couldn’t stop. Logically I\nknew that the scene was absurd—as the big man of the dialogue I weighed in\nat all of 135 pounds, and the five-footer was threatening to go get his big\nfriends.\nBut nevertheless there was a serious air to the confrontation, and already I\nwas sensing that to both of us it meant more than a simple exchange of\n\ninsults. The man was poor, and in my leisure he undoubtedly saw money and\nthe scorn that comes with it. For a year and a half I had been different, and in\nhis small-mindedness I recognized the worst of the hate and fear that I had\ndealt with in Fuling. It was an unfortunate conjunction of sensitivities, but\nnow the trouble had already started and I was unwilling to back down. “Go,\nsmall friend,” I said. “Go find your big friends.”\nThe people laughed, which made him angrier. Mr. Zhang looked worried\nand told the man to leave, but he refused. He stood there ten feet from me,\nstaring furiously.\nI turned back to Mr. Zhang and talked with him as if nothing had\nhappened. A few minutes passed, and the people went back to their routines.\nStill the little man was there, glaring. One of the regular hot pot women\nchatted with me while I held her baby son. The ten-year-old shoeshine girl\ncame over to see the baby, and on the way back to her stand she insulted the\nman.\n“Shenjingbing!” she shouted. “Crazy man! You’re a crazy man! Don’t\ngive trouble to the waiguoren!”\nI looked at the little man and saw that he was growing angrier. Partly it\nwas the girl taunting him, but mostly he was galled by the way that the\npeople were making such a fuss over me—giving me their stools, handing me\ntheir babies. I tried to sympathize with him; he worked his shoeshine stand\nalone, hustling for everything he got, and then the waiguoren with the big\nsalary sat there comfortably, eating barbecue and chatting with the people.\nHe spoke again. Behind his eyes whatever he was thinking had hardened\ninto a little bead of hatred.\n“We Chinese don’t need this kind of waiguoren” he said, loudly. “Why\ndo we let waiguoren like this come to our country? Look at how rude he is,\ninsulting me like that. We don’t need this kind of waiguoren in our home.”\nI knew then that I was capable of matching almost any hatred that he\ncould find. I would not start a fight, but if he struck me I would retaliate. The\nperson that he had angered was somebody I myself didn’t really know,\nbecause that person had never existed at home. Part of what Sichuan had\nchanged about me was that in many ways I was more patient and tolerant\nthan before, but there was also another part that had neither tolerance nor\npatience for more abuse of this sort. I spoke to the crowd.\n“You Chinese don’t need that kind of Chinese,” I said. “This kind of\n\nperson gives you a bad reputation. When I go home I’ll tell people that nearly\nall Chinese are very friendly, like all of you here, but I’ll say that sometimes\nthere is a man like this who hates waiguoren. He’s the one who is rude, and\nhe bothered me for no reason at all. He started the trouble.”\nEverything had gone quiet except for my voice; the silence made me\nshiver. I was angry but I held the emotion down so I could speak clearly.\n“You came and bothered me, small friend,” I said. “I told you to stop. Now if\nyou want a problem, I’ll give you a problem. Come on, small friend. Come\nhere.”\nThe man took a step forward and Mr. Zhang moved between us. The hot\npot woman was yelling at him: “That waiguoren is a teacher! He has culture\n—you shouldn’t treat him like that.” It was clear that nobody was backing the\nlittle man, and without help he wasn’t going to start anything. His big friends\nhad not materialized. He sat back down at his shoeshine stand, glaring at me\nfrom a distance.\nI wanted to leave but I knew that I should wait until it was obvious that I\nwasn’t frightened. I talked with the people and read my paper. Tension was\nstill in the air, and I could see that everybody was waiting to see if the little\nman would make a move.\nI was ashamed of what I had done. I was glad that the people on\nGaosuntang liked me enough to come to my defense, but I knew that I had\nbeen needlessly cruel and petty. The incident left me embarrassed; I had been\neducated at Princeton and Oxford, and yet for some reason I felt the need to\nface off with a Sichuanese shoeshine man until the locals said he had no\nculture. I knew that his harassment had nothing to do with me personally, and\nI knew that I should have sympathy for him, because his bitterness was the\nresult of other pressures.\nBut after a year and a half in Fuling I couldn’t push away the wave of\nhatred that I felt. I could remind myself who I was, and I could think about\nthe advantages that I had received my whole life; but out on the street all of\nthat slipped away. The strangeness and the pressures of life in a place like\nthat were bound to change you, and something inside of me had stiffened\nlong ago. Indeed, I wasn’t certain that the man was entirely wrong: perhaps\nthe people in Fuling didn’t need this kind of waiguoren. But to some extent\nthey had helped create him, and for better or worse we were stuck together.\nI wondered what the little man was thinking. He sat at his stand, staring at\n\nme. Nobody stopped to have his shoes shined. After a while it started to rain.\n“I have to go now,” I said to Mr. Zhang.\n“You should watch your money,” he said, nodding toward the little man.\n“That’s not a problem,” I said. I thanked him and left. Deliberately I\npassed in front of the little man’s stand. He did nothing. Without looking\nback I walked away.\n\nTHE LAND\nApril 15\nTHERE IS A NEW METHOD OF TRANSPLANTING RICE, and about\nhalf of the peasants on Raise the Flag Mountain are using it. In the past,\nseedlings have always been transplanted by hand, row by row, but now many\npeasants are trying paoyang—literally, “throwing the seedlings.”\nThe seeds are first planted in plastic trays, each of which holds five\nhundred plants in individual pockets. When they are ready to be transplanted,\nthe seedlings have a round clump of earth formed around the root; when\nthrown, the weight of this earth carries the seedling and sinks it into the\nmuck. Paoyang saves time—the peasants can throw the shoots from the edge\nof the paddy rather than transplanting each one by hand.\nHalfway up the mountain is a man who has been using this method for\ntwo years. Yesterday he threw his seedlings; today he wades in the paddy,\nstraightening any plants that have slipped out of the mud. He is thirty-five\nyears old, with a black mustache and hard muddy calves. He wears a fake\nbeeper on the belt of his blue trousers. He has one and a half mu of land, or\nroughly a quarter of an acre, which is more land than the average peasant\nworks in these hills.\nNumbers are important here, as they are for farmers anywhere in the\nworld. This particular paddy, one of four that compose his land, is two\nhundred square meters. The peasant estimates that this paddy will use twelve\npans of rice seedlings, which is a total of six thousand plants. These stalks\nwill produce approximately 330 pounds of rice, which will sell for three\nhundred yuan.\nOn the threshing platform of a nearby house a small girl sits at a desk,\ndoing her homework. Beyond the girl is the backdrop of the city with the\n\nsetting sun falling orange behind the gray buildings. Next to the house, two\nyoung men throw seedlings into a newly plowed paddy. They are laughing\nand tossing the rice carelessly in every possible direction. They complain\nabout life in the countryside, although they say that at least in the city they\ncan find construction work, which is better than becoming shoeshine men or\nstick-stick soldiers. “The peasants from the very remote countryside do those\njobs,” says one of the men. “Those of us who live here in the suburbs won’t\ndo that kind of work.”\nHe is asked to compare his life to that of a factory worker, and he thinks\nit over.\n“Peasants, workers,” he says. “It doesn’t matter. They’re all bad jobs.”\nApril 28\nTHE SUN IS UNBEARABLY HOT. It has rained once in the last two\nweeks; a drought is building. The corn plants are now about two feet tall. The\nearth around the stalks is dry and powdery, scorched by the sun.\nIn other parts of the world this strange weather is blamed on El Niño. But\nthe peasants, who never speak of El Niño, have their own reasons for the\nheat. The traditional Chinese lunar calendar follows a system in which a\nmonth must be made up every fourth year—sometimes there is an extra ninth\nmonth, or an extra second month, and so on. This year the extra month is the\nfifth one. Whenever there are two fifth months in one year, you can count on\na hot dry spring followed by an extremely wet summer. This is the way it has\nalways been in the past, and thus the peasants are not surprised by the current\nheat and dryness. Everywhere in the countryside they complain quietly about\nthe problems of having two fifth months in one year.\nMay 5\nMOST OF THE WHEAT IS GONE. Over the weekend it rained, and after\nit dried the peasants harvested almost all of the crop on Raise the Flag\nMountain. It was harvested by hand, with short scythes. The wheat stalks\nwere cut close to the ground, leaving rows of stubble, which will be plowed\ninto the earth when the time comes to sow another crop.\n\nThe loss of the wheat has subtly changed the mountain’s texture. Last\nweek the crop stood soft and yellow along the terraces, but now those fields\nare bare. The cornfields are beginning to fill out, and the transplanted rice has\nstarted to thicken in the muck of the paddies. Soon the lower mountain will\nbe covered by lush carpets of green.\nPeasants are using sticks to beat piles of wheat on the threshing\nplatforms. The sound of their work—a steady swish swish swish—echoes\nthroughout the countryside. There is also the sound of frogs croaking in the\npaddies, and ducks calling out in the small ponds, and the soft rustling of the\nbreeze in the growing corn.\nAlong the southern shoulder of the mountain a long thin field is being\nharvested; workers are piling the wheat stalks into bundles and tying them\nwith reeds. The bundles weigh more than fifty pounds each, and they must be\ncarried to shelters where they will be kept dry. A young man takes a long\nsturdy stick and stabs it into the heart of a bundle, lifting it onto his shoulder.\nHe uses its weight to help him stick the other end deep into another bundle,\nand then he lifts both bales, adjusts the load, and carries them balanced across\nhis back. He walks quickly, moving with a loose-kneed bouncing gait,\nheading toward home.\nMay 11\nAFTER SIX DAYS the harvested wheat field is unrecognizable. It has been\nflooded and half filled with rice shoots, their green tips poking above the\nwater like drowning blades of grass. In less than a week, the wheat field has\nbeen turned into a rice paddy.\nA man wades in the paddy, transplanting the stalks by hand. His sleeves\nand trousers are rolled up. He bends low and moves backward as he works.\nThe rice shoots stretch in neat rows across the water. This peasant does not\nbelieve in paoyang, and so he transplants his rice completely by hand.\nRice is being tended all over the mountain, in all its early stages. Most of\nthe crop has already been transplanted, but the post-wheat paddies are\nrunning later; farther down the slopes a few peasants are still plowing the\nmuck. On the steeper parts of the mountain, where it’s impossible to grow\nrice, the peasants have not quite finished harvesting the wheat.\n\nSimultaneously they are weeding the corn, which will be ready in a little\nmore than a month. The corn stalks are still headless but now they are nearly\nchest-high.\nToday is cool and overcast, the late-afternoon sun breaking through the\nclouds. Westward the Yangtze runs silver between the hills. The level of the\nriver is still low, because the last month has been dry, but spring is always\nlike that in a year with two fifth months. Even as they transplant the rice, and\nharvest the wheat, and weed their corn, the peasants are waiting for the heavy\nsummer rains that they know will eventually arrive.\nJune 10\nRAIN IS COMING. The air hangs still and thick above the river valleys.\nClouds have gathered and faint rumblings echo from beyond White Flat\nMountain.\nTonight it won’t rain much, but at the end of the month it will pour for a\nweek, and then the rains will continue hard throughout July. In August the\ndownpour will not stop. The rivers will swell and rage. In the east, where the\nYangtze leaves the Gorges and enters the flats of central China, the country\nwill suffer its worst floods in decades. Over 64 million acres of farmland will\nbe inundated, and the death count will reach 3,656. All of this will happen\nbecause of the two fifth months, and the peasants on Raise the Flag Mountain\nwill not be surprised to see such a bad summer.\nBut now—in these humid fields, with those clouds dark overhead—now\nit is still spring. The texture of the growing mountain has shifted once more;\nthe corn stands six feet tall and it is at the point where it has just begun to\nripen. The stalks are still a fresh spring green but the tassels are turning pink,\na soft feathery color that sits lightly atop the deep green of the close-planted\nplots.\nThe rice is thigh-high and long-leafed like swamp grass. The water in the\npaddies has dropped to about an inch and now it cannot be seen through the\nlush green. From a distance the rice fields look smooth, like a lawn freshly\ncut.\nAll seasons are beautiful in the countryside of Raise the Flag Mountain,\nbut the long Sichuan spring is the most beautiful of all. And this particular\n\nmoment—today’s ripening corn and growing rice—this may very well be the\nmost beautiful day of the most beautiful season. Next month the corn will be\nharvested, and after that the rice will turn a drab pale yellow; but today any\nchange seems far away. Everything is perfect: the mountain’s texture is\nbalanced like sections of a good painting—the long, even brush strokes of the\nrice plots; the choppy mixed colors of the corn. Standing here in the\ncountryside it is easy to forget that everything is growing, shifting, changing;\nand it is easy to forget that this moment won’t last. It’s like waiting for rain\nwithout worrying.\n\nCHAPTER ELEVEN\n\nSpring Again\nMY FATHER VISITED ME at the start of the spring semester. Since\ncoming to China, I had seen nobody in my family except for my sister\nAngela, who prodded my father until at last he worked up enough courage to\nmake the trip. My mother decided to stay at home.\nI met my father at the Chongqing airport. We stayed in a Chinese hotel\nnear the docks; I figured there was no reason to go to a waiguoren hotel and\nspend four times as much money. During the night the hotel workers called\ntwice on the phone and burst into the room once; it always had something to\ndo with checking our passports. Each interruption terrified my father, who\nwas already badly jet-lagged, and I tried to explain that the workers were\nprobably just curious.\nIn the morning we caught the nine-o’clock slow boat downriver to\nFuling. This, like the hotel, proved to be a serious miscalculation on my part;\nwe could have taken a hydrofoil and cut the travel time in half. I thought that\nmy father would like to get a taste of typical river life, but five and a half\nhours is a lot to taste, and the nine-o’clock slow boat was always full of\nSichuanese unemployed who were heading down to Wuhan to look for work.\nThey sprawled like casualties in the hallways, sleeping, smoking, spitting. It\nwas too crowded to wander around the boat, and the mist was so thick that\nyou couldn’t watch the scenery. My father shivered in his bunk until at last\nwe reached Fuling.\nOn the docks I dickered with the cabbies until I found one who would\ntake us to the college for fifteen yuan. The taxi billowed with Magnificent\nSound smoke, and, as usual, the cabby was inspired by the unexpected\nresponsibility of carrying waiguoren. He flew through the center of town.\nPedestrians scurried in our wake. We swung hard onto the Wu River Great\nBridge and the deep green water flowed far below us. My father clung to the\npassenger grip. The guardrails of the bridge flashed past. The engine roared.\n\n“Why,” my father asked, “does he keep honking?”\nFOR TWO DAYS IN FULING my father couldn’t sleep. The noise, the\ndirt, the language, the endless swarms of people, the constant bustle of life on\nthe streets—all of that was too much. At night he lay awake in bed, listening\nto the horns out on the river. It had taken me half a year to come to grips with\nthe city, and now he was trying to deal with it in ten days.\nHe had always found comfort in hard exercise—at fifty-six years of age\nhe still ran ten miles a day—and I decided that this was the best solution to\nhis insomnia. After all, the simple activity of running had been soothing to\nme when I first arrived in Fuling. So for two days I led him on long runs past\nthe summit of Raise the Flag Mountain, into the rugged hills of the high\ncountryside, where the peasants stopped to stare as we charged past. We went\ntwelve miles a day; I made sure the pace was fast.\nIt worked—two days of that and he slept perfectly. But now his nose ran\nlike a faucet and his throat burned; he hacked up coal dust into my sink. He\nwas sick for the rest of his time in Fuling. My sinuses flared up and I was\nsick, too. My father suggested that we skip the running.\nTHAT WAS PERHAPS the longest week and a half I spent in China. It was\nlike seeing a reflection of my entire first year, cut and spliced and crammed\ninto ten days—all of the fear, the annoyances, the fascination, the wonder of\nthe city; everything hit my father in the space of little more than a week. And\nI found that it was difficult to predict what would bother him, because I had\nbeen in Fuling for so long that I no longer saw it with a true outsider’s eye. A\nslow boat that might seem perfectly fine to me was terrifying to him, while\nother things that I had worried about, like the spiciness of the food, didn’t\npose the slightest problem. Like many Peace Corps volunteers all over the\nworld, I found that the parent visit was a kind of revelation: suddenly I saw\nhow much I had learned and how much I had forgotten.\nBy the third day he was more accustomed to the noise and the air, and\nafter that we spent hours walking through the city. We watched the streetside\ndoctor perform surgery on a peasant’s foot; we watched the blacksmiths\n\npound out chisels on their anvils; we watched the stick-stick soldiers as they\nwatched us. We watched the man at the Lanzhou pulled noodle shop make\nnoodles by hand. We wandered through the markets and watched the workers\ngut eels that had been harvested from the peasant ponds. One morning we\nstumbled onto a small shop in the old town where a man was scrubbing\nsyringes with a dirty brush, and we watched that too.\n“They’re for the hospital,” the man said brightly, when I asked why he\nwas doing that.\n“The main hospital?”\n“Yes, the big hospital!”\nThat was where I’d go if there was a medical emergency. “They use these\nneedles again?” I asked.\n“Of course!”\nI translated everything for my father. I told him what the propaganda\nsigns said, and I introduced him to the regulars all over town. He met Huang\nXiaoqiang and the folks at the Students’ Home; he met the workers at the\npark; he met the barbecue vendors and the ten-year-old shoeshine girl. I\nintroduced him to my friends at the teahouse, and as we left three xiaojies\ncame out of the beauty parlor across the street and started shouting at me:\n“Ho Wei! Ho Wei! Ho Wei!”\n“What does that mean?” my father asked.\n“That’s my Chinese name.”\nThe xiaojies were giggling and yelling my name across the street. They\nwore lots of makeup and their hair was dyed. One was smoking a cigarette.\n“Why are you shouting?” I asked, in Chinese.\n“We’re calling you,” one of them said.\n“Why?”\n“We want you to come here.”\n“How do you know my name?”\n“From Li Jiali—she’s our friend.” All of them giggled after the xiaojie\nsaid that.\n“I have to go now,” I said.\nThey laughed as we walked down the street. My father glanced back and\nasked, “Who are those people?”\nI figured it was a good idea to balance that out with a visit to the church.\nWe met Father Li and chatted in his sitting room. Politely he spoke to my\n\nfather, with me serving as the translator, and I mentioned that the priest still\nused Latin during weekday Masses.\n“Tell him that I used to be an altar boy for Latin Mass,” my father said.\nFather Li nodded and said that nobody else in Fuling still understood the\nlanguage. I asked my father if he still remembered the traditional service, and\nhe nodded.\n“In nomine Patris,” he said, “et Filii, et Spiritus Sancti. Amen.”\n“Introibo ad altare Dei,” responded the priest. “I will go in to the altar of\nGod.”\n“Ad Deum qui laetificat juventutem meam,” my father said. “To God,\nWho giveth joy to my youth.”\nFor a few minutes they went through the beginning of the service. I had\nbeen translating for nearly a week, and now it was strange to sit silent,\nlistening and not understanding a word between these two men that I knew so\nwell. The priest’s Latin was tinged with Sichuanese; my father spoke with an\nAmerican accent. Theirs was a rote, formal dialogue in a rusty old language,\nbut it was clear that something about the conversation changed the way the\ntwo men saw each other. After they were finished, Father Li kept forgetting\nhimself, addressing my father directly in Sichuanese, as if he would\nunderstand. But as we left he used Latin once more. “Dominus vobiscum,” he\nsaid. “The Lord be with you.”\n“Et cum spiritu tuo,” my father said.\nWe went camping in the high peaks south of Fuling, where Gold Buddha\nMountain rose to an altitude of more than seven thousand feet. Adam and I\nhad been there before and it was a beautiful area, completely undeveloped\nexcept for old military factories and bases that had been placed there during\nthe height of the Third Line Project, when Mao had restructured China’s\ndefense industry to protect against the American nuclear threat. Since Deng\nXiaoping began dismantling the project in 1980, the bigger factories in places\nlike Fuling had been converted to civilian use, but many of the smaller ones\nin remote areas were simply abandoned. The transportation was too bad to\njustify conversion, and in any case many of the remote plants had been badly\nbuilt. Even in the boom years of the project, some of the factories had been\nconstructed so quickly and haphazardly that they lasted only a few years\nbefore they had to be built again.\nOn the way to Gold Buddha Mountain, my father and I hiked through a\n\nhigh valley that was full of empty warehouses and factories, crumbling and\ndecrepit, their walls covered with fading propaganda from twenty years ago:\nPrepare for War! Prepare for Famine! Serve the People!\nThe broken walls proclaimed their urgency throughout the silent valley.\nBut there was nobody here to read them anymore; the workers had been\nmoved back to Chongqing, or Fuling, or wherever they had originally come\nfrom. It was just my father and me, hiking alone through the ruins of a valley\nthat had been settled hastily in response to the American atomic bomb.\nFor two nights we camped, hiking up to a cave that led deep into the\nlimestone face of the mountain. The cave mouth was natural, but it had been\nexpanded for some unknown military use—perhaps it had been a munitions\nfactory, or maybe a stockpile—and now there was a long tunnel that led clear\nthrough the heart of Gold Buddha Mountain. We made our way through with\nflashlights, hiking for more than a quarter mile in darkness and finally\ncoming out on the other side, where the northern valley descended to rice\nterraces and the road back to Fuling.\nWe returned to campus and discovered that an English department\nstudent named Belinda had died while we were camping. On Friday\nafternoon she got a headache; on Friday evening she was taken to the\nhospital; by Saturday she was dead. None of the doctors knew why it had\nhappened. She was the second English department student to die in the past\nyear. In addition, one of Dean Fu’s sisters had recently died suddenly, and\nParty Secretary Zhang’s daughter, who was an adorable elementary-school\nstudent, had died during class in the fall. In some ways that child’s death had\nbeen anticipated, if not expected—she had had brain surgery the year before,\nafter which her name was changed. Because of the medical problem, Party\nSecretary Zhang’s wife was given permission to have a second baby. The\nname-changing was a Chinese custom—a changed name in hopes of a change\nof health.\nPeople died in Fuling. It happened everywhere, of course, but it seemed\nto happen with particular frequency and suddenness in the river town. And\n\noften it happened in strange ways; later that year a woman would be killed at\nthe Catholic church when part of the rectory’s roof suddenly caved in. The\nyear after I left, in what was without question the most pointless and pathetic\nof all the Fuling deaths, another English department student died after\nslipping in the squat toilet and striking his head. Small accidents sometimes\nhad disastrous results in a place like Fuling, where the medical care was\nuneven, and the deaths didn’t shock my students as much as I would have\nexpected. They mourned, and then they moved on.\nAnd my father witnessed that as well; along with the rest of us, he helped\nconsole the students as they dealt with the loss of Belinda. But their grief was\nquiet and resolute, as it always seemed to be; and I felt overwhelmed by the\npoignancy of that combination of helplessness and strength.\nAND THEN THE WHIRLWIND of those ten days was over. On my\nfather’s final afternoon in Fuling, we hiked halfway up Raise the Flag\nMountain. It was a warm day; the sun glowed bright above the city. In the\nhills there was a soft breeze. A farmer was preparing his rice paddies, and he\ninvited us into his home to rest. We sat on rough stools in the inner courtyard.\nNobody was shouting; there weren’t any cars or crowds; no propaganda was\nin sight. We simply sat there, breathing the clean fresh air of the countryside.\nThe farmer’s mother came out to speak with us. The old woman was\neighty-one years old, and she laughed when I asked if she had grown up in\nthe house. “This used to be the landlord’s home!” she said. “I was too poor to\nlive in a place like this.”\nIt was a huge, sprawling complex, and the woman told me that it had\nbeen built 150 years ago. Several families lived there now. The roof was tiled\nand there were old-fashioned carved figures along the eaves. There were very\nfew buildings like that in the Fuling countryside, and I asked what had\nhappened to the landlord and his family.\n“They were kicked out in the 1950s, after Liberation,” the women said.\n“They were sent north, to the countryside past White Flat Mountain. I don’t\nknow what happened to them.”\nHer daughter-in-law was listening and she turned to me. “Do you have\nlandlords in your country?”\n\n“No,” I said.\nI was translating everything for my father and he disagreed with that. “Of\ncourse we have landlords in America,” he said. I thought it over and realized\nthat he was right. After two years it almost seemed exotic, a country whose\nlandlords hadn’t been killed or exiled.\n“I made a mistake,” I said to the woman. “We do have landlords in my\ncountry.”\n“That’s what I’ve heard,” she said. “But all of our landlords in China are\ngone.”\nFor nearly an hour we sat there in the former landlord’s house, chatting\nwith the people. Somebody led a water buffalo through the courtyard. The\nchildren returned from school. There was a teenage girl whom my father\nthought looked like my sister Angela—something in the way she carried\nherself. The sun dropped orange behind the city. We thanked the family and\nleft, walking back through the fields.\n“I never would have imagined that I could do that,” my father said. “Just\ngo into a Chinese peasant’s home and talk with them like that. If I were you,\nI’d go up to that place every week.”\nI looked at my father; he was smiling and walking easily through the\nfields. For the first time I realized that he wasn’t nearly as tired as me. All of\nFuling had blazed past him in a bright blur, two years in ten days, and now he\nwas going home. I envied him that—but at the same time I was thankful that\nhe was right; I could go back to the peasant home anytime I wished.\nSHORTLY AFTER MY FATHER LEFT, Adam’s parents arrived, and he\nlearned from some of my mistakes while repeating others. They stayed in\nChongqing’s Holiday Inn, but they caught the same kind of slow boat and\nhad the same taxi adventures. And at the beginning his parents had the same\nfrazzled look that I had seen in my father.\nAfter a few days, Adam planned an evening lecture for the students. His\nparents, who used to live in the countryside of Wisconsin, would show some\nslides and talk about American farming. Adam went to the waiban office and\ntold Mr. Wang, who was the foreign affairs officer. This was something I\nhadn’t done when my father lectured—my personal policy was to clear\n\nnothing with the waiban, because that only left you open to unpredictable\ncomplications. But Adam thought Mr. Wang might want to hear the lecture,\nand so he told him. Mr. Wang said that unfortunately the students would be\nbusy on Wednesday night.\n“They have class?” Adam asked.\n“They already have something planned. I’m sorry.”\n“That’s no problem,” Adam said. “We can do it on Thursday.”\nMr. Wang laughed lightly. He always laughed lightly at everything. It\nwas the sort of laugh that made you distrust Mr. Wang until you got to know\nhim better, and then you trusted him even less.\n“I’m afraid that won’t be possible,” he said. “The students will be busy\non Thursday, too.”\n“In the evening?”\n“Yes.”\n“Well, I’ll talk with them and find a time that works, and I’ll tell you. I\nthought you might want to hear the lecture, too.”\n“Actually,” said Mr. Wang brightly, “it won’t be possible for your\nparents to talk with the students.”\n“Why not?”\n“People in the college have decided that it is not appropriate.” He laughed\nagain.\n“How can it not be appropriate? They’re studying English, aren’t they?\nThis is a good opportunity for them to practice, and it’s only about farming—\nthere’s nothing political. They’re just going to talk about the countryside\nwhere we used to live.”\n“Yes, but you must teach your own courses.”\n“My parents have taught for many years at an American college. They are\nbetter teachers than me, but if that’s the problem, we can have an extra class.\nI just think it’s a good chance for the students to listen to different English\nspeakers.”\n“Believe me, I understand,” said Mr. Wang, “I would very much like to\nhear their lecture, but Mr. Tan is opposed. I’m sorry about that.”\nThis was one of Mr. Wang’s favorite routines—Good Cadre/Bad Cadre.\nMr. Tan was an upper-level administrator who was in charge of the waiban,\nand usually he was Mr. Wang’s Bad Cadre. In fact, we thought that Mr. Tan\nwas the most likable administrator in the college, a friendly man who was far\n\nmore honest with us. Things would have been simpler if we had been allowed\nto deal with him directly, but it was more useful to keep Mr. Tan at a safe\ndistance, where he could be the Bad Cadre.\n“How about this?” Adam said. “I’ll teach the class, and then afterward\nthe students can ask my parents questions. Is that okay?”\n“I’m afraid not.”\n“So my parents can’t talk with the, students?”\n“Oh, certainly they can talk with the students!”\n“But if I have class they can’t say anything?”\n“That’s correct.”\nThe next day Adam called role and canceled class. The students were free\nto leave, he said, but if they wanted to stay and listen to Mr. and Mrs. Meier,\nthey were welcome to do so. Nobody left. His parents showed slides and\nlectured on American agriculture. The students asked questions. The\nquestions were answered. No cadres were there, but undoubtedly they heard\nabout it later.\nBy that semester we were growing less tolerant of the mindless political\nrestrictions. Generally I avoided the cadres, which fortunately wasn’t hard to\ndo. I never went to the waiban unless it was absolutely necessary, and I tried\nnot to talk with any of the administrators. In my apartment I had two\ntelephones: one for outside calls and a campus line. It worked nicely because\nonly the cadres used the campus line, which I never answered.\nMr. Wang was the only one whom I really disliked—time and time again\nhe had proven to be particularly oily and dishonest. I didn’t feel the same way\nabout any of the others, but something about them depressed me. Dean Fu\nwas perhaps the saddest case, because I knew that he genuinely liked us and\ncared about our welfare, and yet he seemed to be under immense pressure\nfrom above, and a few times this had prevented him from being open with us.\nInvariably it was like that—there was always some pressure coming from\nabove, the Bad Cadres pushing the Good Cadres. There were lots of Good\nCadres and you never met the Bad ones, but somehow they seemed to decide\nhow everything worked.\nBack in December, Sunni, Adam, and I had written a short version of A\nChristmas Carol, so our speaking classes could perform the Dickens play.\nDuring our preparations, I was called into Dean Fu’s office, where he told me\nnervously that under no circumstances could we teach Christmas carols to the\n\nstudents.\n“You know that the Communist Party is very sensitive about spreading\nreligion,” he said. “I’m sorry, but the students are not allowed to sing\nChristmas songs in class.”\n“Can we talk about Christmas at all? They’re studying American\nculture.”\n“Yes. That is fine. But they can’t sing songs.”\n“What about songs that aren’t religious? There’s a part in the play where\nthey’re supposed to be singing Christmas songs, and I could have them sing\none that isn’t about religion at all. You know, in America for many people\nChristmas isn’t a religious holiday. For example, there’s a song that goes,\n‘We wish you a Merry Christmas, we wish you a Merry Christmas, we wish\nyou a Merry Christmas, and a Happy New Year!’”\n“No,” said Dean Fu, still smiling tightly. “I’m afraid that we can have no\nsongs about Christmas. I’m sorry, but you know it is not my decision.”\nI could have pointed out that even in spring the campus propaganda\nspeakers, as part of their noon entertainment program, often played a Muzak\nversion of “What Child Is This?” But I knew the argument was hopeless;\nthere was no logic to any of it. And in the same spirit I instructed my classes\nto replace the Christmas carols with patriotic Communist songs, which if\nanything improved Dickens. My favorite scene was when a furious Scrooge\nswung his cane at a band of merry carolers who were belting out “The East Is\nRed,” singing the praises of Mao Zedong while the old man shouted,\n“Humbug!”\nMost of our problems with the administration were more absurd than\nanything else, and rarely were they significant: I couldn’t care less about\nteaching Christmas carols. But it seemed that after a year and a half some of\nthis awkwardness should have passed; we should have become good enough\nfriends to speak comfortably about something so insignificant.\nBut other restrictions weren’t so minor. Sunni and Noreen’s Chinese\ntutors were two young women who worked in the English department, and\nover the course of the year they became good friends. During a holiday that\nspring, one of the teachers invited Sunni and Noreen to her home, and then, at\nthe last moment, revoked the invitation, explaining that there was a problem\nwith the road. It seemed strange—the spring rains hadn’t yet arrived and\nthere was no reason for a road to be washed out. And later we learned that\n\ndepartment officials had instructed the young teacher not to invite the two\nwaiguoren to her home. Ostensibly the reason was that they were afraid\nsomething would happen to Sunni and Noreen, and the teacher would be\nresponsible. But more likely the command stemmed from the same shapeless\nparanoia that had shadowed us from the start—the sense that waiguoren were\npolitically risky and should be kept at a distance.\nThese commands always took place behind our backs, which was the\nworst part. It served to transfer the paranoia, until we overanalyzed every\nminor conversation and every small change of plans, looking for signs of\nmanipulation. When Sunni and Noreen told me about the canceled invitation,\nthe first thing I did was go to the local bus station, where the drivers said\nexactly what I expected—the road wasn’t washed out, which meant that\nsomebody in the college had lied to Sunni and Noreen. It was a classic\npattern in any Communist system, where fear and paranoia pass from one\nlevel to the next, creating a network of perfect distrust.\nBut increasingly we realized that this distrust was well earned; our\nparanoia wasn’t unfounded. We had friends who told us the way things\nworked, and it was startling to see the degree to which we were managed.\nWhen the movie Titanic came out that spring, one of our colleagues invited\nus to his home to watch the film on videodisc, but again the invitation was\nrevoked at the last moment. Later, he explained candidly that the cadres had\nbeen afraid that the waiguoren would realize that the movie was pirated—a\nlaughable cover-up considering that it was impossible to go anywhere in\nFuling without having a vendor shove a bootleg copy of Titanic in your face.\nThe movie was so popular that they hung an enormous promotional sign\nabove the local theater, a curious marriage of propaganda and advertising:\nThe Futong Jewelry Store is the Sole Sponsor of Titanic, Which Has\nBeen Recommended by President and Party Secretary Jiang Zemin.\nBy now the department commands were often doubly self-defeating: not\nonly did we realize that the movie was pirated, but we saw clearly the degree\nto which the college hoped to manipulate the world around us. At the same\n\ntime, we recognized how inconsistent this control was, because in many other\nways the college gave us impressive leeway. This was particularly true with\nregard to our teaching, which logically should have been where we were\nrestricted the most. Apart from the occasional petty incident like Adam’s\nlecture or the Dickens play, our teaching freedom was arguably greater than it\nwould have been in America. Nobody checked our syllabi or hassled us about\ncourse content, and we structured our classes exactly as we wished. I was\nespecially impressed that they even let us teach classes like literature and\nculture, which often had strong political overtones.\nFor the most part they treated us well, and, considering Fuling’s\nremoteness and lack of foreigners, they trusted us quite a bit. But that final\nsmall step hadn’t yet been taken, and it was all the more frustrating because\nso many of the more important barriers were already gone. By the spring I\nrealized that these last obstacles would not be removed during my time in\nFuling, and I tried not to worry about it. Other aspects of life had gone much\nbetter.\nIn particular, our relations with the students had improved a great deal\nduring the second year. Much of this was because of Adam, who had always\nbeen a more dedicated teacher, spending extra time with the students and\nhelping them set up a library in our office. He was the first waiguoren teacher\nto really win their trust, and, since in their minds the two of us were virtually\nindistinguishable, it was natural that they extended this trust to me.\nBut also time made a difference—they had known us for two years. This\nwasn’t simply a matter of their coming to accept the waiguoren; we had\nchanged a great deal, and now we had a much better understanding of how to\napproach them. They could still count on our informality, which from the\nbeginning had distinguished us from other teachers on campus. But they also\nknew that we could be serious, and in those moments we weren’t\npropagandists; in particular, we tended to be blunt when it came to discussing\nAmerica. That semester I taught “Désirée’s Baby” and Langston Hughes,\nwhile Adam’s American Culture class focused on the civil rights movement.\nHe pulled no punches with that unit, which included videos of James\nMeredith lying beside a Mississippi highway, shot by a racist sniper. The\nstudents knew that nobody had forced Adam to show those films—he could\nhave given positive lectures about American success in technology, or\neconomics, or education—and it made the students more willing to be honest\n\nabout things that they felt were important.\nAnother critical difference was that now we spoke Chinese. In the fall I\nhad first started talking with some of the students in Chinese when I met\nthem outside of class, because they liked to hear what I was learning. But as\ntime passed, I realized that this wasn’t simply a novelty; like me, they were\ncompletely different people when they spoke the language. They were much\nmore at ease, and this wasn’t just a linguistic issue; it was political as well.\nOne evening after Adam’s parents left, I was eating in the Students’\nHome when Jimmy, Mo, and George stopped by. They were three of my\nfavorite third-year students and we chatted lightly in English. They asked if\nAdam’s parents had enjoyed Fuling, and I said that they had, except that they\nweren’t particularly impressed by the cadres.\nThe three of them leaned close around the table. “Weishenme?” Jimmy\nasked softly. I answered in English: “Because they thought the waiban was\nrude to them, and they didn’t understand why.”\n“Women waiban gan shenme?”\nNow I responded in Chinese, telling them the story. In China it was\nseriously disrespectful to make somebody’s parents feel unwelcome, and\nthere was disappointment in the students’ eyes. I told them frankly about the\nway I saw the department, and how small incidents like this added up over\ntime. Mo and George were both Party Members; a year ago I would never\nhave spoken honestly to them in this way. But using Chinese made\neverybody more comfortable, including me.\nAs I began to meet the students more frequently outside of class, I\nnoticed how strong this pattern was: whenever something sensitive came up,\nwe handled it in Chinese. It amazed me, because English should have been\nour secret language—virtually nobody else could understand it off campus,\nand it was the safest way to discuss such topics without anybody hearing. But\neven in a crowded restaurant like the Students’ Home we switched to Chinese\nat key points, when we talked about politics, or sex, or our guanxi with the\ncollege. Even the best students often made that shift, despite their English\nbeing better than my Chinese.\nAt last I realized that the fear wasn’t of somebody else hearing. It was a\nquestion of comfort, because uncertain topics were more easily handled in\ntheir native language. But also I sensed that the true fear was of themselves:\nvirtually all of the limits had been established in their own minds. English\n\nhad been learned at school, and thus it was indistinguishable from the\neducational system and its political regulations. When they spoke the\nlanguage, warning bells automatically went off in their heads—it was a\nschool language, as well as a waiguoren language, and in both of those\ncontexts they had been trained to think and speak carefully. Once I realized\nthat these limits were internal, I began to wonder if it was the same way with\nthe Bad Cadres. Perhaps they existed only in a small corner of the Good\nCadres’ minds, a nagging fear that got the best of everybody’s good\nintentions.\nTHAT SPRING A NUMBER OF THE BOY STUDENTS decided that\nthey needed English surnames. The foreign teachers had Chinese family\nnames; why should the students be different?\nI first noticed this trend when I was grading papers one day and thought:\nWho the hell is George Baker Frost? I had never heard of him before, but\nthere was his assignment with the name written proudly in enormous letters\nacross the top of the page.\nI read the paper and realized it had been written by George—the cockiest\nstudent in the class, a handsome boy who was also one of the best athletes.\nHe was a trend-setter, too, and soon I began to get assignments from William\nFoster, who had formerly been Willie, and who subsequently promoted\nhimself to William Jefferson Foster. It wasn’t long before William Jefferson\nFoster persuaded his girlfriend to become Nancy Drew (that was Adam’s\nrecommendation), and then Mo, who was the class monitor and couldn’t\nallow his authority to be undermined by any perceived shortcoming, started\nshopping for surnames. He asked me for suggestions, and soon he was\nsigning his papers Mo Money.\nSome of the boys undertook to improve Adam’s and my command of the\ndialect, and the people at the Students’ Home were very pleased when we\nbegan using the new words and phrases in daily conversation. “Now you are\na real Zhongguotong!” Huang Neng said proudly. “A China hand!”\nIt was only a matter of time before the department caught wind of this\ndevelopment, and one day George Baker Frost pulled me aside during a break\nin class. As a Party Member he had some of the clearest connections to the\n\ntop.\n“The English department wants us to stop teaching you those words,” he\nsaid.\n“Those sons of turtles,” I said in Chinese. “They are very toothbrush.”\nGeorge grinned and glanced behind him. To say that somebody was\ntoothbrush was a particularly biting insult in the Chongqing dialect. In other\nparts of Sichuan it was completely meaningless, but for some unknown\nreason it carried heavy connotations along the eastern river valleys, where it\nwas used as an adjective. It meant, more or less, that you were useless.\n“We must be careful,” George said.\nI wanted to say: The walls have ears. But I smiled and nodded in\nagreement.\n“Maybe you should not say those words too close to the college,” he said.\n“Otherwise they will give us trouble.”\nWe agreed to a no-fire zone around the teaching building, but inevitably\nsuch limits failed. This was risky ground—calling people toothbrush was\neven more treacherous than singing Christmas carols—and soon our shared\ndissidence brought us even closer to the students. And by now the flow of\nlanguage, which went both ways, was out of control. Ever since we had\nstudied Jonathan Swift in the first semester, the students had been infatuated\nwith the word “yahoo.” It sounded like a Chinese word; in fact, it even had\nsome similarity with “toothbrush,” which was yashua. For whatever reason,\nthe students said “yahoo” constantly, and it was all the more charming\nbecause many of them, with their Sichuanese tendency to confuse the f and h\nsounds, pronounced it “yafoo.” That was also how Huang Kai said the word,\nwhich represented his first English lesson. Often when I came for lunch at the\nStudents Home he looked up at me and shouted, solemnly, “Yafoo!” As a\nliterature teacher I considered that to be perhaps my proudest achievement; I\nknew that Swift would have been thrilled to see this Chinese two-year-old\nstumbling around in his split-bottomed pants, calling foreigners yahoos.\nIn the fall Adam had started a Spanish class, which further complicated\nmatters. Soon tonto, or “stupid,” also became ubiquitous; along with yashua\nand “yahoo” it seemed to be everywhere, from the top floor of the teaching\nbuilding down to the Students’ Home. I almost felt sorry for the department\nofficials—I could only imagine how confused they were by all of this\nnonsense, and how the Bad Cadres were working overtime as they tried to\n\nassess the political risks of Jonathan Swift and Spanish stupidity. Probably\nthey were eager for us to leave and take all of these words with us; but there\nwere still several months to go, and three languages and one dialect provided\nenormous potential for abuse.\nAs a teacher I no longer felt the discomfort of my first spring—that sense\nof a waiguoren standing alone in front of the class—and this year’s students\nnever bowed their heads in shared shame. I was pleased to see that finally it\nwas possible to talk with them outside of class, and our relationship had a\ncombination of humor and seriousness that seemed perfect for China. For the\nfirst time, college life seemed human, and the students, who had so often\nstruck me as talented but unfortunate pawns, became much fuller figures in\nmy eyes.\nOne of my favorites was Linda, who felt no need for a last name. She was\npossibly the brightest of the third-year students, and the year before she had\nbeen nominated for a transfer to the Sichuan Foreign Language Institute in\nChongqing. That was a big step up from Fuling; every year a handful of elite\nstudents were selected to transfer, which meant that they were no longer\nlocked into the track of becoming peasant schoolteachers. But the selection\nprocess was both heavily political and prone to favoritism, and Linda had\nfailed the perfunctory physical exam because one of the physical education\nteachers held a grudge against her from freshman year. Actually, Linda was\none of the better athletes among the girl students, and this injustice caused\nquite a bit of anger in the English department, but there was nothing anybody\ncould do—the PE teacher had the final say. It was a typical example of the\nmindlessly cruel bullying that was routinely tolerated on campus, especially\nfrom the PE department.\nLinda handled it as well as one could expect. She was accustomed to that\ncombination of helplessness and strength—her mother had died not long\nbefore, and now in the spring her father was struggling with cancer. Both\nLinda and her sister had been to palm readers that spring, and in both cases\nthe fortune was the same: Your father will die soon. Adam and I saw that as\nan indication that one should avoid fortune-tellers, and we told Linda as\nmuch; but she knew that she was stuck with her fate, and so she bore it\nquietly. A few times that semester she traveled home for the weekend, but\nalways she kept up a front of normalcy. Even when her father became very ill\nshe remained the best student in class.\n\nOne evening in the library she showed me her photo albums. Looking at a\nstudent’s album was always a strange experience, because the Chinese saw\nno purpose in pictures that did not feature themselves. For a people known\nfor modesty it always struck me as an odd chink in their armor, a sudden\nburst of narcissism—a photo album might have more than fifty face shots of\nthe owner. I never knew quite how to react: what do you say after looking at\nfifty photographs of a young woman’s face?\nAdam’s policy was to pause at every single picture and ask, “Who’s\nthis?”\n“That’s me!” the owner of the book would say.\nAdam would turn the page. “Who’s this?”\n“That’s me!”\nAdam found that routine endlessly entertaining; sometimes I had to leave\nthe office when he started it, so I wouldn’t hit him after hearing him ask the\nquestion for the twentieth time. I never had the patience, and so I flipped\nthrough Linda’s albums as quickly as I could without being rude. The photos\nconsisted of all the standard xiaojie poses—often in parks, rarely smiling;\nsometimes with hats, heavy makeup, a soft filter on the lens; holding a\nflower, chin turned up dreamily, back slightly arched. There were two albums\nand it took five minutes. After I was finished I gave them back and said,\n“Very beautiful!”\n“No, not very beautiful,” she said, and then she smiled. “But beautiful\nenough.”\nI realized that she was precisely correct—she was a pretty girl, but not so\npretty that it became a distraction or eclipsed her other talents. That was\nanother example of the sort of pragmatism that I often saw in Fuling, where\npeople seemed much more capable of viewing themselves with cold\njudgment than Americans. And mostly the people in Fuling tended to know\nexactly the hand they had been dealt. Linda had had more than her share of\nbad luck, but she also had her gifts, and she would do what she could with\nthose.\nOn another evening Adam and I ate dinner with her and Mo Money, and\nwe had a couple of beers and began to speak seriously in Chinese. The\nconversation turned to the pro-democracy demonstrations in Tiananmen\nSquare, which was a rare topic in Fuling. Most people had very little sense of\nwhat had happened in 1989; there had been some small protests in Fuling,\n\nwith students marching down to South Mountain Gate, and people had heard\nvague rumors of violence in Chengdu and Beijing. But almost nobody had\nany sense of the massacre’s scale. One of the few exceptions was my\nphotographer friend Ke Xianlong, who listened carefully to the Voice of\nAmerica and knew that foreign reports estimated the death count to be at least\nin the hundreds.\nHe was one of the least patriotic Chinese I knew in Fuling. During my\nfirst year he had expressed his disdain for the students’ excitement about\nHong Kong’s return, which he attributed to their ignorance and immaturity.\nTo my surprise, he saw the pro-democracy movement in similar terms.\n“All of that was so stupid,” he told me once, when we talked about the\n1989 student movement. “Many of the problems the students criticized were\naccurate, of course, but what did they know about it? How could they lead\nthe country? Students are students. They don’t know anything about real life,\nbecause they’re too young. They’re not yet mature, and they haven’t ever\nworked like Old Hundred Names, which means that often they complain\nabout things they don’t understand.”\nWhen I thought about it, I could see his point, at least in the sense that it\nwas never a good sign when a nation turned to twenty-one-year-olds as its\nmoral voice. But it seemed horrible that China’s current crop of twenty-one-\nyear-olds had no clear idea of what had happened less than a decade earlier. I\nsaid this to Linda and Mo Money during our dinner, partly because I was\ninterested in seeing how they would react.\nMo Money was a Party Member, but the topic didn’t make him\ndefensive, and he didn’t deny what had happened, which was the\ngovernment’s stance. He knew that my information was probably more\naccurate than what the official sources said, and there was no point in arguing\nabout the extent of the crackdown.\n“But you have to understand,” he said, “there isn’t much I can do about\nwhat happened at that time. It’s not because I don’t care—I wish there was\nsomething that could be done about it. But that’s just not possible, so all I can\ndo is try to be a good student and then become a good teacher after\ngraduation. I think that’s all I can do.”\nIn many ways he reminded me of Teacher Kong, who was also a Party\nMember with an idealistic streak. Both men still had faith that the system\nwould work itself out eventually, and they believed that it required a certain\n\namount of forgiveness, patience, and loyalty from people like themselves.\nTheir faith wasn’t so much specifically in Party theory as in the notion that\npeople like them could—and should—contribute to society, despite its flaws.\nIt was in some ways a democratic line of thought, or at least a hopeful\nlonging to find democracy buried somewhere within the corruption of the\ncurrent system. They simply couldn’t bear the thought of entirely refusing to\nparticipate.\nLinda wasn’t a Party Member, although I was certain that somebody so\ntalented could have joined if she had wished. I asked her why she had never\napplied.\n“I have no interest in joining the Party,” she said. “I’ve never wanted to\ndo that, and I don’t want to do it now. I think that these are important topics\nthat we are talking about, and perhaps someday there will be something I can\ndo. But right now it is too complicated.”\nShe spoke evenly and I saw that her response was as honest as Mo\nMoney’s. Both of them were disengaged from the problem, like virtually\neverybody I knew in Fuling, although Linda’s and Mo Money’s reasons were\ndifferent. Mo Money had decided that by being politically involved at the\nsmallest level he could somehow overcome his powerlessness with regard to\nbigger issues, while Linda simply had other things to worry about. She had\nalready been dealt enough cards; everything else could wait. Many people in\nFuling were like that, and after two years I finally understood why.\nIT WAS A DRY, DUSTY MARCH, and on the final weekend I went for a\nlong hike up the Wu River. It was the same weekend as last year’s walk, the\nsame route. I had always liked the cycles of the countryside and that was my\npersonal ritual, to camp beside the green springtime river at the end of March.\nI crossed the first two side valleys and came to the Fuling Liangtang ore\nfactory. Nothing here had changed in the past year, although now I could read\ntwo of the propaganda signs whose characters had been unrecognizable last\nyear:\nDiligence—Friendliness—Obedience\n\nRespect the Rules and All Will Be Glorious;\nBreak the Rules and the Operation of Machinery Can Cause Shame\nThree carts of gravel came hurtling down the hillside, the workers\ngrinning and hooting as they rode atop the piles of white rock. I passed last\nyear’s sign:\nHappy Happy Go to Work, Safe Safe Return Home.\nI decided that that would be my mantra for the day: happy happy, safe\nsafe. I repeated the words to myself as I hiked across the scarred hillside, and\nthen I descended into the deep green valleys whose streams washed westward\ntoward the Wu.\nSpring was everywhere in those valleys—the blooming paulownia trees,\nthe golden fields of rapeseed that shivered in the breeze, the eager plots of\nradish and lettuce and onions and broad beans. The rice seedlings were bright\nand green beneath sheets of plastic stretched taut over bamboo frames.\nI came to the fourth cross valley where a peasant was guiding a plow\nbehind a water buffalo. The man’s trousers were rolled up past his knees as\nhe waded in the muck. The air was sweet with the heavy scent of a nearby\nrapeseed plot. The old man’s wife and grandson were sitting beside the field,\nand I stopped to say hello.\nThe woman looked at me intently. “I saw you last year, didn’t I?” she\nasked.\n“Yes, I came through last year. I live in Fuling.”\nThe man stopped plowing and smiled. “I remember,” he said. “You had a\nmap and you were asking which way to go. But you didn’t understand what\nwe said, and you went the wrong way. We were trying to help!”\nI promised that this year I would get it straight. They asked what I did in\nFuling, and I told them I was a teacher.\n\n“He’s a teacher, too!” the woman said, gesturing at her husband. “He\nteaches in the elementary school, Monday to Friday, but on Saturday and\nSunday he works out here.”\nHe untied the buffalo, sending it off to graze in the rapeseed. The man\nwas fifty-four years old, small and thin and as strong as the ox he followed.\nHe had black hair in a neat crew cut, and I could see that he would look like a\nteacher if he cleaned up. But today was a peasant weekend; his legs were\ncovered with mud, and brown flecks ran up his clothes all the way to his hair.\nHe offered me a cigarette, lit one for himself, and sat on a rock. I dropped\nmy pack and rested in the sunshine. The man asked if I was German.\n“No,” I said. “I’m American.”\n“There was a German who came through here recently.”\n“Really? What was he doing?”\n“I’m not certain. He was studying something here. And he was walking\nvery fast—in the hills he walked even faster than the local people! He had a\ntranslator, and he was a rich man who had paid his way to China. What’s\nyour salary?”\nI told him, and he nodded. “That’s better than most. Teachers’ salaries\nhere in the countryside are much lower than that. But I think that German\nmade a lot more than you.”\nHis grandson was five years old and he darted behind me, laughing and\ngrabbing at my shirt. The man grinned and scolded him softly. “He’s very\nnaughty,” he said proudly. I nodded and rubbed the boy’s black head. I was\nthinking about the German—it amazed me that another waiguoren had come\nto this remote place. To be honest, it annoyed me; I had always liked to think\nthat I was the only one who had ever passed through this part of the\ncountryside.\nBack in the fall I had thought I saw another foreigner in Fuling, although\nI wasn’t certain—it was only a fleeting glance of a man entering a restaurant,\nand I couldn’t tell if he was actually a foreigner. The only confirmed\nwaiguoren sighting for my entire two years had been back in January, when\ntwo Danish tourists got stranded when their boat to Chongqing docked for\nrepairs. I ran into them at California Beef Noodle King USA, which was\nFuling’s closest approximation to a fast-food joint. The restaurant had spicy\nnoodles and I ate there once or twice a week, and often the owner asked me if\nshe was doing a good job of serving the proper California style. I always\n\nassured her that indeed it was precisely the same as what I would expect if I\nordered Beef Noodle King back in California, which always pleased her.\nThey even had the sign in English above the restaurant, and this was probably\nwhy the Danish women had gone inside.\nThey glanced sharply at me when I entered the restaurant, and then they\nlooked away, as if they hadn’t noticed. From my own trips in the past I knew\nthat this was a traveler’s routine—you came to a remote place and resented\nthe presence of any other tourists. But in Fuling I wasn’t a tourist, and to have\nother waiguoren treat me as if I had violated their solitude did not please me.\nI said nothing and sat at a table not far from the Danes.\nThey spoke no Chinese and hadn’t been in the country long. They\nordered by pointing at pictures on the wall, and the waitress asked them if\nthey wanted hot pepper on their noodles. The Danes did not understand, but\nthey could tell from the waitress’s tone that this was an important choice, and\nthey thumbed madly through a phrase book. I was resolved not to help until\nthey acknowledged my presence.\nThey kept working at the phrase book until finally the waitress, who\nknew me, asked if I would translate. The Danes acted very surprised that I\nwas there, and they said that they did not want hot pepper. I was tempted to\ntell the waitress that the Danes not only wanted hot pepper but seemed\nscornful of Sichuanese lajiao, scoffing that in the great country of Denmark\nsuch a mild spice would be considered candy for babies. But I told her the\ntruth; I realized that they were simply acting the way any traveler would, just\nas I had done myself in other places at other times.\nWe talked for a while and they couldn’t believe that I lived in a town like\nthis, because the attention in Fuling overwhelmed them.\n“These people,” one of the Danes said, “all they do is stare. Everywhere\nwe go, they stare at us. Do they stare at you, too?”\n“Yes,” I said, “but not as much as they stare at you.”\nI hadn’t intended it as an insult, but the women seemed to take it as such.\nI didn’t care enough to explain that I simply meant that the people were more\naccustomed to me. But I gave the Danes my phone number out of courtesy, in\ncase something went wrong, and then I left them to the stick-stick soldiers.\nHere in the countryside of the Wu River I thought about the German and\nwondered if this area would ever get to the point where waiguoren were\ncommon. The old woman saw me looking out at the scenery, and she asked if\n\nmy home had hills like these.\n“Some places do,” I said. “But my home is flatter than Fuling.”\n“What’s the farming like?”\n“There aren’t very many farmers, and they have more land. One farmer\nmight have hundreds of mu. In my country the farms use machines.”\nThe man nodded. “It’s like Xinjiang,” he said, “and in the north of China,\nwhere there’s more land and it’s flat. They use machines there as well. But\nhere we can’t.”\nWe talked about farming and he asked me if it was true that peasants in\nAmerica used airplanes to plant rice. Quite a few people in the countryside\naround Fuling seemed to have heard about this; it was a common question\nwhen I walked in the fields. I always said that indeed Californian rice was\nsometimes sowed by plane, and often I could see the wheels turning in their\nheads as the Sichuanese peasants looked at the scene around them—the plow,\nthe ox, the primal muck—and tried to factor an airplane into the arrangement.\nToday the peasant shook his head and grinned, looking down at his legs,\nwhere the mud had dried yellow-brown. Beneath the layer of dirt his sinews\nwere taut and strong along his calves.\n“You came the same time last year, didn’t you?” he asked.\n“Yes, last year I also came in March.”\n“Did you notice that it’s different this year? Last year you saw that we\nhad so many more paddies with water, but this year the rains haven’t come\nyet, and everything is later than usual. It’s too dry.”\nFor a while he complained softly about the lack of rain, explaining that it\nwould set back the whole spring schedule. But all the peasants could do was\nwait, hoping to survive the dryness of a spring that had two fifth months.\nIT WAS WARM and I sweated under my pack. I stopped for lunch at the\nsame place as last year, on the bluffs high above the Wu. I looked down on\nthe river far below and thought: Happy happy, safe safe. The mist had faded\nand the sunlight flashed in streaks of gold along the river.\nPeople all through the hills remembered me from the year before. They\nalso talked about the German, who had left a deep impression. I stopped to\nrest at one peasant home and the people told me that he had worn boots like\n\nmine.\n“He was a zhuanjia—an expert,” an old man said. “He was studying the\ntrees here, I think. He came because this is such a poor area.”\nThe old man’s name was Yang. He gave me boiled water with sugar and I\nsat with him on his family’s threshing platform. There was the old man and\nhis son, the son’s wife, and a four-month-old baby. They were doing quite\nwell; for a decade they had had electricity. Their rice was growing thick\nunder plastic coverings. They had six pigs. They had a cat on a leash with a\nplastic Pepsi bottle tied to the other end. The bottle was partly filled with\nwater and it kept the cat from going very far. I had never much liked cats and\nthe Pepsi bottle struck me as a good idea.\nThe old man’s wife came out of the house. She was seventy-three years\nold and complained vehemently about their farm, which was in the most\nbeautiful valley I had passed through today. “It hasn’t rained for months!”\nshe said. “Last year at this time our fields were already flooded—look at this!\nIt’s horrible! This place is so poor!”\nThey were like farmers anywhere—pessimistic and angry at the weather.\nI often heard similar comments in the relatively affluent rural suburbs of\nFuling, where I sensed that these complaints were a form of humility that\nmasked contentment. And perhaps it was a sort of superstition, a way of\nguarding against the dangers of pride. Traditionally the Chinese did the same\nthing with children, trying not to lavish too much praise on a child because\nthe attention could draw bad luck.\nThe woman invited me to dinner, just as the teacher-peasant had done at\nmy first stop, and I explained that I had to continue hiking. In the countryside\nit was a common invitation—virtually every time I went for a long walk in\nthe fields somebody offered me a meal. It seemed that you could travel\nindefinitely in rural Sichuan without any money at all, because the people\nwere so generous that they considered it rude not to offer a meal or a place to\nstay.\nA while later I met a young man in his early twenties who was with his\nyounger brother, a twelve-year-old boy. The boy wore his school sweat suit\nand he recognized me immediately.\n“Are you the waiguoren who won the long race last year in Fuling?” he\nasked.\n“Yes.”\n\n“I’ve seen you near the college. I go to the East River Middle School.”\nThere were no middle schools in this part of the countryside and the\nchildren boarded in Fuling if they wanted to continue their education. The\nboy paid 170 yuan a month for room and board, and his older brother\nestimated that probably 90 percent of the children in this region continued\ntheir education to middle school. They took the boat downstream to Fuling\nand usually came home every other weekend.\nA group of children gathered around, staring. The twelve-year-old boy\ntold them that I was the waiguoren who had won the Fuling long race, which\nhe described in vivid detail, emphasizing the great distance by which I had\ntriumphed. I was embarrassed to hear the story, although by now I was used\nto it; even after more than a year it was the reason many people in Fuling\nknew who I was.\nIt impressed me that so many of the students in this remote area traveled\nall the way to Fuling for school, and I realized that these were the sort of\nchildren that my own students would teach after graduation. Here I could see\nthe point of my job—not just the literature I taught, but also the simple fact\nthat for nearly two years I had had a role in an education system that included\nchildren like this.\nI felt the same way whenever I hiked into the fields behind college and\nsaw the students doing their homework on their families’ threshing platforms.\nOn sunny afternoons there was a child on virtually every platform—Fuling\nschools assigned an enormous amount of homework, and the students did it\nwith remarkable diligence, even if they were from uneducated peasant\nfamilies. I had come to recognize this as perhaps the characteristic that I\nadmired the most about the local people: they had an enormous respect for\neducation, and it was easy to feel good about teaching in a place like that.\nIn this respect my views had changed quite a bit from the spring of my\nfirst year, when I had been so pessimistic about the education system’s\nconstant propaganda. In some ways, it helped to get outside of the classroom\n—when I walked through the hills and saw the children doing their\nschoolwork, it reminded me of my own students, and the places where they\nhad come from and the places where they would someday return to teach. I\ncame to realize that, although much of the propaganda still disgusted me, it\nwasn’t necessarily the most important issue. The slogans wouldn’t last\nforever—nothing in China did—but the children who were educated would\n\nstay that way, regardless of the country’s changes.\nWHENEVER I WAS UNCERTAIN about which way to walk, I simply\nasked the people where I had gone last year. Everybody knew—it seemed\nthere wasn’t a single person who didn’t remember me. And they all talked\nabout the German, too; I wished I could have met him, because now I was\ncurious about what he had been studying. It was like following Kurtz up the\nCongo; I kept hearing snatches of information, details about the way he\nwalked and how much money he had and the boots he wore. And then I\nrealized that he must have heard about me as well, and that probably he had\nfelt he was following some unknown waiguoren through the rugged hills of\nthe Wu River valley.\nIn late afternoon I began to make my way down toward the river. I came\nthrough a sunny valley that opened onto a broad square field with houses in\nthe corners. I stopped to rest and a group of peasant women gathered around.\nMost of them were in their sixties, dressed in blue, and I told them that this\nwas a beautiful area.\n“This place isn’t any good,” one of them said. “This is a qiong shanqu—a\npoor mountainous region. The economy here is terrible.”\nI always complimented peasants so I could hear them run down the\nplaces where they lived. They never seemed happier than when they stood\nthere in the sunshine, next to the flourishing rapeseed and wheat and young\nrice, and talked about what a miserable home they had.\nA young girl came up to me. “Are you the waiguoren in Fuling who does\nlong runs?”\n“Yes.”\nShe turned to the old women. “They had a long race in Fuling and he was\nthe best.”\n“That’s why he can walk out here,” one of the women said. “He’s very\nhealthy. Look how few clothes he’s wearing!”\n“Look how big his bag is!” said another. “How heavy!”\n“His feet are so big—look at those enormous shoes!”\nThey studied me for a while and I waited for somebody to ask about my\nsalary. But one of the women turned to me and asked instead, “In your\n\ncountry, do you have planned-birth policy?”\n“No. You can have as many children as you want.”\nThey shook their heads, amazed. I told them that in America there wasn’t\na population problem, and so the rules were different from those in China.\n“How many children are in your family?” one of the women asked.\n“Four. Three sisters and me.”\n“Here you can’t do that,” she said. “Only one—if you have another, you\nhave to pay a fine.”\n“More than ten thousand yuan!” another woman interjected.\nSome children had come over to look at me, and I noticed two small boys\nstanding together.\n“What about them?” I asked. “They look like brothers.”\n“That’s right,” the old woman said. “Their parents had to pay a fine.”\nOne of the boys was about four years old; his brother was six or seven.\nThey were filthy, and they stood tentatively on a wheat terrace above us,\nafraid of the waiguoren. A little girl of about five came over—a tiny thing\nwith wild black hair and dirt-smudged cheeks. Wide-eyed, the child stared at\nme. She had enormous coal-black eyes, like my youngest sister, Birgitta,\nwhen she was little. I smiled, and the girl smiled back.\n“She’s the third in her family!” one of the women said.\n“Oh,” I said. “They must have paid a big fine.”\n“No,” the woman said. “Their house was tuile!”\n“What?”\n“Their house was tuile!”\n“Tuile?”\n“Right!”\nI couldn’t believe it, so I quickly sketched the character on my notebook.\n“This tui?”\n“That’s right.”\nIt meant any number of things: to push, turn, cut, infer, shift, postpone,\nelect. But when you tui’ed a house it meant simply that you knocked it over.\nThe local planned-birth officials had pushed over the girl’s house because she\nhad been the third child.\nI had read of such things in the foreign press, but I had always assumed\nthat they only happened in very remote areas. But then I realized that I had\nbeen walking all day, and this small beautiful valley was nothing if not\n\nremote.\nThe old women were shaking their heads and looking at the little girl. She\nwasn’t comfortable hearing this conversation and something in her\nexpression said: Sorry. Undoubtedly there were complications to growing up\nwhen you knew that your birth had caused your family’s home to be knocked\nover. But there was also something else in her eyes; it was vague and\nundefined and meant, essentially: Some things are worth more than money\nand houses. The old women saw it, too. One of them tousled the girl’s hair,\nand then she ran off to play with the other children in the unplowed fields.\nI DIDN’T MAKE IT TO LAST YEAR’S CAMPSITE. I spent too much\ntime talking with people, and finally I pulled up short. But I found a good\nspot in the hills high above the Wu River, where I ate dinner and read Ted\nWilliams’s autobiography. I decided that I would read that book every spring\nfor the rest of my life. He wasn’t particularly happy happy whenever he went\nto work for the Red Sox, and I respected that. Also there was something\ndistinctly American about his voice—the cockiness and the earthy slang and\nthe rhythms of his prose. And especially I liked the way the book began:\n“I wanted to be the greatest hitter who ever lived….”\nIn the morning I broke camp early and caught a boat downriver. The\nwater level was low and the limestone cliffs along the bank were white and\nclean-looking, streaked by diagonal grooves and cuts jutting up from the\nchalky green Wu. Fifteen feet above the waterline I could see the dark\nsmudge on the rocks where the summer river would rise. It was Sunday and\nthe boat was crowded with peasant children heading back to school. I stood at\nthe stern and watched the white cliffs slip past in the mist, knowing that I\nwould never see this part of the river again. That was my last spring in\nFuling.\n\nTHE RIVER\nTHE RIVER IS THE QUICKEST WAY out of Chongqing. The city has a\nnew airport and a new expressway, and the railroad, although now aging, was\na technological breakthrough when it was completed in 1952—the first great\npostwar achievement of Deng Xiaoping, acting as Mao’s lieutenant in the\nsouthwest. But none of them has improved on the Yangtze. The trains are\nslow, and road traffic is bad, and, because of pollution and the river-valley\nfog, planes are often delayed. The convenience of the river has always been\nhere, and in one form or another it always will be.\nToday the Zhonghua, the six-o’clock slow boat, is preparing to leave\nChongqing, and its passengers are more than ready to go. It has been a\nstifling June day, the sunshine filtered hot and humid through the city’s coal-\ntinted haze, and the travelers are tired and grumpy. Many of them are tourists;\nthey have come from all across China, arriving on crowded trains and\nheartbroken old buses. Tempers have melted in the Sichuan heat. Ten\nminutes before departure, an argument breaks out between a passenger and a\nworker on the top deck.\nThe passenger is big, with a bull neck and short bristly hair and heavy\nuseful hands. His eyes are tight black beads of anger in a round face that\nglistens with sweat. He is moneyed—this is obvious from his clothes, from\nhis slick-shined shoes and his silk shirt, and mostly it is obvious from his\nstatus as a tourist. Domestic tourism in China has boomed in the last decade,\nbut still the average Chinese does not travel far simply for pleasure. Tourists\nlike this man are part of a new class, and often their money is tangible in the\nway it literally surrounds their persons: in the fine clothes that they wear, in\nthe beepers and cell phones that are clipped to their belts, and, often, in the\nsimple well-fed bulk of their bodies.\nMoney is the problem today; the passenger is not satisfied with the\nquality of his third-class cabin. He purchased his ticket from a broker at\n\nChongqing’s Chaotianmen Docks, where he was promised a fine boat, and\nthe Zhonghua—serviceable but worn, its decks grimy with river filth—is not\na fine boat. The passenger has come a long way to see the Three Gorges, he\nsays, and his ticket was not cheap. His slurred words are angry and in one\nmeaty fist he grabs the worker’s shoulder epaulet, holding the man close\nwhile speaking loudly in his face.\nThe worker is smaller, a young man in his late twenties who is too weak\nto pull himself free. He wears a dirty blue-and-white-striped uniform shirt,\nand speaking rapidly he tries to defend himself: he did not sell the tickets, he\nhas no connection to the broker at Chaotianmen, and the passenger should not\nbe so pushy. But by now a crowd has gathered, and their voices begin to rise\nin shared complaint, until at last the worker’s superior arrives to rescue him.\nThe passenger keeps his hold on the worker while directing his\ncomplaints to the superior, who makes the same excuses that have already\nbeen made, but he makes them with more confidence. For a few minutes the\nconfrontation is at a standstill, but the crowd shifts restlessly, sensing a\nconclusion.\nFinally the big man says, “Do you have any second-class cabins?” And as\nsimply as that the dispute is resolved. Money is exchanged; the tourist and\nthe supervisor shake hands. The big man passes out cigarettes to everybody\ninvolved. The crowd disperses. The little man, his pride wounded, smoothes\nhis crumpled epaulets and retreats to the rail of the deck with his ill-bought\ncigarette. Nobody notices him—and then the Zhonghua sounds its horn and\npushes away from the dock, and the argument is forgotten as the passengers\nwatch the city slip past, the boat floating out into the heart of the great wide\nYangtze.\nTHREE MILES NORTH OF CHONGQING, the river abruptly turns east,\nthe bend marked by a shrine to Buddha and an old weather-stained pagoda\nperched high above the water. The hills begin to rise—green rugged hills,\nfalling away to blanched sheets of limestone stained by last year’s high-water\nmarks. Many of these slopes are too steep for factories or apartment\nbuildings, and small farms become more common as the boat cruises east.\nThe peasants’ homes are simple: mud or brick walls topped by a gray tiled\n\nroof. Often they are shaded by clusters of banana trees. And all along the\nriver are crop terraces, carved into the sloping hills where factories can find\nno foothold.\nThe scenery is quietly beautiful—not breathtaking, but mesmerizing in\nthe gentle roughness of the hills and the broken regularity of the terraced\nfields. And just as quietly Chongqing has been left behind, and suddenly it is\nclear that everything in this landscape has been shaped by the steady power\nof the Yangtze.\nFor the river here has strength. Sometimes it widens to several hundred\nfeet, and sometimes it is pinched close between steep hills, but always the\ncurrent is powerful. The Yangtze carries snowmelt from the western\nmountains, and it has already been joined by most of its seven hundred\ntributaries, and so it slips quickly through the hills. Of the world’s great\nrivers, only the Amazon pushes more water to the sea.\nThe sun is dropping now and a soft cooling breeze sweeps across the\nriver. Most of the travelers stand on the Zhonghua’s deck, watching the hills\nslip past. A cluster of Guangdong businessmen hold cell phones to their ears,\nchattering loudly in Cantonese. A young woman stands alone against the rail,\nher long black hair and short pink skirt flowing in the wind.\nThe air is clean now, with only a few wispy clouds scratched across the\nfading blue dome of the sky. The small fishing sampans are starting to dock\nfor the evening, and the Zhonghua passes a group of children playing\nbarefoot in the shallows. Corn stands high in the hills. The crop is two\nmonths old and it has just begun to ripen; the stalks are a fresh spring green\nbut the tips are starting to fade toward gold.\nThere is no rice growing on the riverbanks; the hills are too steep for that.\nSome of the slopes are too rocky for corn, but even in the roughest land there\nis always some sign of cultivation—at the least, a single patch of corn tucked\ninto a break in the rock. The crop rows are vertical, running down the\nhillside, and they have been half-terraced and leveled as much as possible.\nIt is not an easy place to make a living. Even the most successful farms—\nthe ones with two-story houses, large pig huts, big cement threshing\nplatforms, and a dozen corn plots carved into the hillside—even these farms\nspeak of the difficulty of growing crops in such a landscape. Every terrace\nhas been shaped by human effort, by successive generations of the same clan,\nby decades and perhaps centuries of work. All of it consisted of the simple\n\nlabor of hands and feet and basic tools, and the terrain has been changed so\ngradually that the work of the peasants seems as inevitable as a force of\nnature—something as determined and powerful as the river itself. Human\nhistory sits heavily on the land, as it so often does in China.\nThe sun sets. The sky glows orange, the hills darken, the round ball of the\nsun sends a bright band of light skipping along the boat’s wake. And then,\nbehind the western hills, the sun sets.\nIN A THIRD-CLASS CABIN a young man and woman arrange their\nluggage on the floor. They could be eighteen years old or they could be\nthirty; like many young Chinese, they simply look young. There are eight\nberths in the cabin, stacked in bunks of two. An old woman sitting on a lower\nbunk asks the couple if the last two beds are theirs.\n“We’re sharing a berth,” the young woman says. “We were just married.”\nThere is nothing unusual about passengers sharing beds, but the young\nwoman’s husband reddens in embarrassment. The woman, pretty with short\nbobbed hair, smiles and touches his shoulder.\nThe two women talk politely for a while. They ask each other if they have\neaten, and where they are going, and what they were doing in Chongqing.\nThe married couple is returning home to Yichang, the old woman to Wuhan,\nand none of them has anything good to say about Chongqing.\n“It’s very backward,” says the old woman, shaking her head. “The\npeople’s salaries are too low, the cost of living too high.”\nThe young woman agrees, remarking that the Chongqing transportation is\ninconvenient, and that the city is not as good as Yichang.\nHer husband says nothing. He helps his wife slip off her shoes, and then\nhe climbs into bed beside her. By the light of the cabin he reads a magazine\nwhile she dozes. The bunk is less than three feet wide but they lounge\ncomfortably.\nThe nighttime river is peaceful. The summer stars are out tonight; the Big\nDipper glows steady above the gently rocking boat, and a quarter-moon\nhangs bright in the southern sky. The Yangtze is black except for the lights\nthat streak across its water. By now there are few homes along the banks, and\neven fewer with their lights on. Most of the light comes from the river—from\n\nthe low strips of sandstone along shore, faintly luminescent in the evening,\nand from the dinghies and the shore markers. Red lights blink on the south\nside of the river, green on the north; the night boats pass between, their\nsearchlights sweeping silently across the water.\nAt night there are no hydrofoils, no fishing boats, no two-man sampans.\nOccasionally the Zhonghua passes a long flat bank where the smaller boats\nhave docked for the night, pulled onto shore next to bamboo shacks whose\nwindows glow warmly—makeshift restaurants, hotels, mah-jongg parlors.\nThe barge traffic has all but stopped.\nMost of the other boats on the river are big passenger ships that pass like\nfloating islands of light. Some have come upstream all the way from\nShanghai, traveling through the flats of Anhui province, past the lakes of\nHubei, the factories of Wuhan, the cliffs of the Three Gorges, and now, a few\nhours outside of Chongqing, they are nearly home.\nAfter a while the young woman wakes up. She shifts in the bunk, drawing\nclose to her husband. “Ni shi shei?” she says softly, playfully. “Who are\nyou?”\nHer husband murmurs something in response and she laughs quietly. The\ndoor to the cabin is open, and outside there is the steady hum of the motor\nand the gentle sound of the river slapping against the hull of the boat. “Who\nare you?” the woman whispers again. “Who are you?”\nFEW PASSENGERS DISEMBARK AT FULING. Most are going another\ntwo days through the Gorges to Yichang, or three nights to Wuhan. And so\nFuling appears like a break in a dream—the quiet river, the cabins full of\ntravelers drifting off to sleep, the lights of the city rising from the blackness\nof the Yangtze.\nFour hours have passed since Chongqing. Lights cluster on the banks:\nhomes, factories, cars. A newly constructed bridge slips overhead. The boat’s\nloudspeakers crackle, announcing that Fuling is the next stop, and then the\ndream of the river is over and the city comes into view.\nThe heart of Fuling is built up around a cove in the river. From the broad\narc of this cove the city rises on steep hills like a curtain patchworked with\nlights—the weak lights of shopkeepers’ lamps, the flashing beams of\n\nmotocab headlights, the steady yellow squares of windows—and this well-lit\ncurtain falls and flickers above the black water of the Yangtze. The Zhonghua\nmoves toward the shore, its horn booming, gradually bringing the dock\ncloser. The boat draws southward until it is out of the main current of the\nriver, until the great force of the Yangtze has been left behind, and then it\ndocks.\n\nCHAPTER TWELVE\n\nUpstream\nIN LITERATURE CLASS for that last semester we studied Washington\nIrving, Edgar Allan Poe, Mark Twain, Kate Chopin, Jack London, Robert\nFrost, and Langston Hughes, and then for the last unit I assigned Amy Tan\nand some Chinese-American poets. The literature came at the students from\nfar away—Rip Van Winkle and the jumping frog and Hughes’s distant rivers\n—but then suddenly we were watching the end of the Joy Luck Club movie,\nwhen the Chinese-American narrator comes to China and meets her sisters. It\nwas the first time that China truly entered my literature class; the students had\nperformed Shakespeare with Chinese Characteristics, and they had written\nabout Robin Hood coming to China, but these had only been ways of putting\nforeign literature into familiar contexts. Now we were really here: the\nnarrator was embracing her long-lost sisters, and all of the girls in my class\nwere crying, and most of the boys were trying hard not to.\nAfterward I asked them to write about their families, describing their\nparents’ and grandparents’ lives. One student, a girl named Dina, wrote a\npoem:\nLooking Back at My Ancestors\nA weak woman,\nSitting in a shabby hut\nSpinning yarn again and again\nShe can’t go out\nAs she was fettered by feudalism deeply\n\nIn 1921\nThe CPC was founded\nMy grandmother went out for revolution\nTo Shanghai, to Chongqing\nMost of our country had her track.\nMy mother, a young woman\nDuring the Great Cultural Revolution\nActed as a Red Guard\nDenied all the advanced thing\nCalling Long Live Chairman Mao.\nMany of them, like Linda, wrote about life in the countryside:\nMy great grandmother was born of a poor family. She had to be as a\nservant for a landlord. She suffered a lot. She doesn’t have enough food\nto feed in, and doesn’t have enough clothes to shelter from cold. She\nwas treated unfairly by her master.\nAlso, my grandmother’s situation didn’t improve much. Her feet were\nalso banded with great pain. She had given five children’s birth.\nUnfortunately, three of them dided of hunger. This made my\ngrandmother very sad. She cried and cried for three days. And what was\nworse her husband dided of illness. She became a widow for thirty years\nthrough hardship and difficulties.\nMy mother’s life was a little better than them, since she was born just\nwhen the New China was born. My mother was not very tall, but she\nwas very kind and beautiful. She treated us tenderly. Of course, her life\nwas not very satisfactory at all. She had to make a living by hard work.\nShe went out on cold days for getting grass for pigs; carried coal from\nfar away for heat; and she stayed up sewing for us. She contributed her\nlife to her family.\n\nNearly all of the papers were like that, and I found that I could not grade\nthem—not even a check in the corner. There was nothing about them that I\ncould touch, and some of them I could hardly read, because they were so\npoignant. In the end I couldn’t bring myself to return the stories, and so I kept\nthem, simply telling the students that everybody had done a good job.\nTheir writings made me think about the future as much as the past. I saw\nthe steady quiet struggle that had taken the students to where they were now,\nand for the next generation it would probably look much the same. I\nimagined Linda’s own daughter as a young woman—perhaps a college\nstudent with a life that was a notch better than her mother’s. And I imagined\nher writing, “My mother was not very tall, but she was very kind and\nbeautiful….”\nAFTER CLASS I often walked in the countryside behind campus. I had\nstopped running and it was pleasant to walk—everything had slowed down; I\ncould talk with the peasants and watch them do their work. Often they asked\nif I knew the waiguoren who ran in the hills, and I told them that it was\nsomething I no longer did, which seemed to relieve them. There had never\nbeen any point to charging up Raise the Flag Mountain.\nIn the evenings and on weekends I followed my city routines. Sunday\nmornings had been refined to perfection—church, the priest, the blacksmiths,\nthe teahouse, and then I ordered dumplings from a restaurant across the street\nfrom the South Mountain Gate Park. The dumplings were the best in Fuling\nand usually I started eating at eleven o’clock sharp, when the twelve-piece\nbrass band began to play in the park. The band was hired almost every\nSunday morning for weddings, because a good wedding attracted as much\nattention as possible—there was big face in that. The band played “Auld\nLang Syne” and “Oh Come All Ye Faithful” and sure enough the stick-stick\nsoldiers always came faithfully, gawking at the bride as she arrived in bright\nmakeup and a full dress.\nAt the restaurant I usually took one particular seat where I could lean\nback against the wall and look out at the street and the park. Once the weather\nturned warm, the parade of everyday life on the sidewalk was even better\nthan the band—peasants with their baskets, families with their children,\n\nyoung couples out for a stroll, old women with umbrellas held against the\nsunshine.\nDuring the week I often visited Gao Ming and Ma Fulai, two friends\nwhom I had met in the park during the Spring Festival. Gao Ming was an\nartist; he was twenty-six years old and a few years earlier he had graduated\nfrom the Sichuan Institute of Fine Arts. He was quite gifted—his apartment\nwas full of fine oil paintings that he had done in school, mostly in a European\nstyle. He owned his own business in Fuling, and his company specialized in\nmassive sheets of frosted glass upon which he painted and etched flowers,\nbamboo groves, panda bears, and other Chinese motifs. Generally the glass\nwas set into dividers and walls of expensive restaurants and apartments, and\nGao Ming was particularly good at this kind of work, which meant that his\nsheets of frosted glass were particularly tacky. This was no fault of his; he\nsimply painted what people asked him to paint, and usually they asked him to\ncram as many shapes and colors as possible onto a sheet of frosted glass.\nHis clientele was the Fuling rich, and sometimes I accompanied him as he\nwent to their apartments to make deliveries or take orders. Every rich person\nin the city seemed to decorate in precisely the same way, with certain objects\nthat were universally accepted in Fuling as signs of wealth: Gao Ming’s style\nof glasswork, ornate ceiling lights surrounded by baroque constructions of\nplaster and velvet, odd wooden trellises that were covered with plastic vines\nand grapes. Another common decoration was an enormous wooden watch\nthat hung on the wall as a clock. And of course they always had top-of-the-\nline televisions, VCD players, and karaoke machines. These people were\nwhat you would call nouveaux riches in other countries, but in Fuling such a\nterm was meaningless unless you kept track by the minute. There were no\nvieux riches and I didn’t blame them for showing off what they finally had.\nI liked going with Gao Ming on his rounds, and none of the rich people\nseemed to mind, because having a waiguoren in your apartment was even\nclassier than a trellis full of fat plastic grapes. But the rich people themselves\nwere the best decorations of all. Invariably the men had big hair-sprayed\npompadours and flashy silk shirts, and the women, whose faces were\nspectacularly made up, wore see-through dresses and lounged on overstuffed\ncouches. I never could figure out what they did all day long, especially the\nwomen; they usually looked as if they had just arrived or were getting ready\nto leave. And yet they always sat there on the couches.\n\nGao Ming made more than ten thousand yuan a month, but he had\nconstant employee problems and his life was a mess. He had a seven-month-\nold daughter who lived with his wife, a Chongqing-based artist, and Gao\nMing had taken advantage of this job-related separation to find a girlfriend in\nFuling. When his wife finally heard about this arrangement, she took the\nbaby off to Henan province, where she found another job. She was\nthreatening to get a divorce, which didn’t seem to faze Gao Ming; he was\nconfident that she would return, although at the same time he made no effort\nto get rid of his girlfriend, who was a classic raspy-voiced Sichuanese xiaojie\nwith a sharp wit. Gao Ming simply wasn’t one to worry about the future; his\ngoal was to have a good time, and so he gambled, went to karaoke bars, and,\nI suspected, hired prostitutes—certainly he talked about them a lot. Some\ndays he lost as much as eight hundred yuan playing mah-jongg. He was a\nlousy mah-jongg player.\nHe liked talking with me about these problems because he assumed that I\nunderstood his lifestyle, which in his opinion was distinctly American.\n“People’s minds in our China still aren’t very open,” he told me once. “In\nyour country you can have a friend who is a girl, but here it always causes a\nproblem. My wife is like that, because she isn’t open-minded.” I didn’t know\nhow to respond to that—having affairs wasn’t exactly my vision of the\nbenefits of Reform and Opening. Usually I said nothing at all; as a waiguoren\nI was often most comfortable when I was listening.\nOn warm nights Gao Ming sometimes told me about his troubles while\nwe ate hot pot, which was a specialty of eastern Sichuan. It’s meaningless to\nsay that hot pot was spicy—everything the people ate in Sichuan was spicy,\nfrom breakfast rolls dipped in hot pepper to kongpao chicken. Some Peace\nCorps volunteers developed ulcers from the sheer heat of the food.\nBut even in such a cuisine, hot pot stood out as particularly spicy:\nvegetables, meat and noodles cooked in hot oil over an open flame right at\nyour table. People ate it year-round, but it was particularly popular in the\nsummer; the theory was that the hot pot made you sweat, and the sweat made\nyou cool.\nHot pot stands appeared on the Fuling sidewalks during summer\nevenings, when it became as much a social event as a meal—you sat in front\nof the bubbling pot, gazing at the pedestrians as they paraded past. Gao Ming\nand I would eat slowly, watching for xiaojies, and if he was in a good mood\n\nhe talked about things he hoped to buy. Once or twice on bad days he spoke\nof his possible divorce. But usually he saw the bright side of things, and\nseveral times he described the wedding ceremony he’d like to have with his\nwife if they didn’t get divorced first. They had been married for five years,\nbut like many people in Fuling, they had postponed the wedding until they\nwould have enough money to afford an impressive ceremony. Now Gao\nMing had the cash but not the wife; fortunately, he was enough of an optimist\nto overlook this awkward fact, speaking fondly of the magnificent wedding\nhe had in mind. “I’ll rent lots of cars,” he told me one night. “Ten cars—there\nwill have to be at least ten cars. We’ll drive around South Mountain Gate and\nup to Gaosuntang, and out to the East River district, and then we’ll drive\nback. Everybody out on the street will stop to watch.”\nIn some respects, Gao Ming’s friend Ma Fulai was similar: he also had a\nbaby daughter, a wife, and a girlfriend. But he had made the mistake of\ncollecting all of these in Fuling, and he was a tortured soul without any of\nGao Ming’s blithe hopefulness. Ma Fulai often came to me for advice, partly\nbecause he assumed that an American would know how to solve such\ncomplications. But I also sensed that he talked with me because he knew that\nas a waiguoren I was outside the loop. A few of my city friends saw me in\nthis light; they knew that I wasn’t connected to the local gossip networks, and\nso they told me their secrets and asked for advice.\nOne night in late April, Ma Fulai came to my apartment and sat smoking\nin my living room. I could see that he was upset, but he wouldn’t say what\nwas wrong. We talked for a while and then I tried being direct.\n“Are you having some problem with your wife?”\nHe nodded and blew out a cloud of smoke. But still he said nothing.\n“Does she have another boyfriend?” I knew this probably wasn’t the\nissue, but it seemed an easy way to open things. He shook his head quickly.\n“That’s not it,” he said. “The problem is just that we don’t get along. We\nhave nothing in common—no hobbies, no interests, nothing. We fight all the\ntime. It’s been like that since we were married.”\n“Why did you marry?”\n“Because of her parents. Her father and mother put pressure on me.”\n“How did they do that?”\n“Maybe you don’t understand. Here in our China it’s not like it is in your\ncountry. Here if you start to have guanxi with somebody, with a girl, then you\n\nhave to get married.” He sighed and drew on his cigarette. “What I mean is,\nonce you start sexual guanxi, you have to get married. So that’s what\nhappened with my wife and me. I was twenty-four and she was twenty-two.\nSo I married her, even though I knew we weren’t suitable.”\nI said nothing. It was seven o’clock on a warm night, and I let him think\nfor a while in the fading twilight.\n“I don’t know what to do,” he said. “Do you have any advice?”\n“It’s very complicated. Perhaps there’s no easy solution.”\n“All day long I think of this problem. It gives me a headache. All day\nlong, that’s what I think about.”\n“I know that Gao Ming has a girlfriend,” I said. “Do you have one?”\nThere was a pause, and then he nodded.\n“Who is it?”\n“She’s a student here at the college. Remember the girl I come to see\nsometimes on campus? She’s not really my cousin, like I told you before. We\nget along very well. In all respects I like her better than my wife.”\nI had assumed that she was his girlfriend; nothing of that sort surprised\nme. Adam had young male friends in town who were much the same way—\ndivorced or on their way to it, with small children and shifting girlfriends. It\ndidn’t seem nearly as common among campus workers, and probably this\nwas also true in other traditional danweis, but many of the young people\ninvolved in business seemed to be having affairs. They had money, and they\nweren’t tied to an old-style work unit that could influence and even regulate\ntheir behavior; yet at the same time they followed the standard Fuling pattern\nof marrying and having their child as quickly as possible. I asked Ma Fulai if\nhis wife knew about his girlfriend.\n“No,” he said. “She has no idea.”\n“Are you sure? Gao Ming’s wife was all the way in Chongqing but she\nstill found out about his girlfriend.”\n“My wife doesn’t know; I’m certain of it. If I ever go anywhere with the\ngirl, we go someplace where there aren’t any other people.”\nI wondered where in Fuling that might be, and I thought that I might like\nto go there myself sometime. Ma Fulai sighed again.\n“My marriage is very bad,” he said. “The only good thing is my daughter\n—other than her, we have nothing in common. We never talk and we don’t\neat together. We sleep in separate beds. You’ve seen my apartment—each of\n\nus has a separate room, and I sleep in the small bed. Her parents and her\nbrothers are like strangers to me. They know I don’t love her.”\n“What does she want to do about it?”\n“She doesn’t want to do anything.”\n“Why not?”\n“Because she loves me. And maybe she thinks this is the way a marriage\nshould be.”\n“What do you want to do?”\n“I don’t know,” he said. “Do you have any ideas? What would people do\nin your country?”\n“This problem is the same in my country. It’s bad to divorce with a small\nbaby. But if there was no baby of course they’d divorce very quickly.”\n“It’s not the same here,” he said. “Divorce isn’t very easy, even if you\ndon’t have a child. It’s because the thought here is still so traditional and\nclosed. It’s like it might have been in your country in the 1940s and 1950s.\nThe problem is that women aren’t the same as men—they still aren’t equal.\nSo a divorce affects them very much. A divorced woman has no face.”\n“What about a man?”\n“It’s not very good either; some people will say you’re a bad man. But\nit’s not nearly as bad as it is for the woman. All of these ideas are very\nbackward here, like the attitudes toward sex—the way you have to marry\nsomebody if you have sex with her. It’s better in your country. I don’t like\nother things about your country, but I wish that in this way China was the\nsame as America.”\n“In America there are too many divorces,” I said. “People think it’s too\neasy. So perhaps it’s not good in either place.”\nWe sat in silence for a while. It was nearly dark and I had no advice to\ngive him. I said the same things I always said—move slowly, be patient,\nthink about the baby. He had heard it all before, and he sat there shaking his\nhead.\n“Everybody has this problem,” he said. “Young people, old people—all\nof them have the same problem. It’s because they have to get married so\nsoon, because there’s no sexual freedom. Probably 80 percent of them are\nunhappy like me. All of my friends are unsatisfied with their marriages, but\nthey know that divorce is difficult, too. Perhaps you don’t understand this,\nbut it’s a serious problem.”\n\nHe asked me if he could sit in my apartment for a while, and I said that\nwas fine. I had a literature class review session later, and I prepared my\nmaterial, thinking about Ma Fulai and other friends like Gao Ming. I doubted\nthat the problem was simply a lack of sexual freedom; rather it seemed that\nthere was just enough freedom to get the trouble started. Later there would be\nmore sexual freedom, but this might not do wonders for the people in Fuling,\neither. Often I found it hard to explain that certain things were complicated\nno matter where you lived.\nThe only honest advice I could ever think of was: Don’t get married. But\nthis wasn’t particularly realistic and it was easy for me to say; as a waiguoren\nthat was yet another way in which I was beyond the pale, because I wasn’t\ngoing to be married in Fuling. None of those issues touched me directly, and\nI watched from a distance, the way I did with so many other things. It was\nlike wandering through rich people’s apartments, or reading the stories my\nstudents wrote, or standing out on my balcony watching the Yangtze boats\nslip past to unknown destinations. There was a certain power to that, because\nmany things did not touch me, and from this distance there were moments—a\ntrip down the river, a day in the countryside—that stayed with me in all of\ntheir vividness and beauty. But often there was helplessness and sometimes\nthere was sadness. Sitting there with Ma Fulai, I knew that there would be\nsomething good about bringing this part of my life to a close. I watched him\nsmoke another cigarette, and then he left.\nTHAT SPRING was Beijing University’s hundredth anniversary, which\nnationwide celebrations combined with the seventy-ninth anniversary of the\nMay Fourth Movement. There was a television special in which Da Shan, the\nChinese-speaking Canadian, told jokes and introduced floor shows on a stage\nin the Beijing campus.\nThe May Fourth Movement had occurred in 1919, in response to the\nVersailles Treaty. This agreement rewarded Chinese contributions to the\nAllied victory by granting former German concessions like Qingdao to the\nJapanese—an injustice that naturally outraged the Chinese people. The\nmovement began as a student protest, expanding to include a wide range of\nreform-minded Chinese intellectuals. It was a nationalistic protest that\n\nsimultaneously reached out to the West; “science” and “democracy” were its\ncatchwords.\nThe Communist Party claimed that the May Fourth Movement was a\npredecessor to its own uprising, which was a particularly brazen instance of\nappropriating history. Indeed, some of the May Fourth leaders were\nCommunist or eventually turned to Communism, but it was a stretch to link\ntheir ideals to the attitude of today’s Party. As a result, the television special\nwas a surreal mixture of contradictions: Communist Party officials praised\nthe memory of student activists; speeches extolled “science” and\n“democracy” and the Beijing University campus proudly commemorated the\nevents of 1919 while tactfully making no mention of what had happened\nthere in 1989. Da Shan told his usual jokes. In its own strange way the event\nmade for gripping television.\nFuling Teachers College joined in the celebration by staging a short play\ncompetition to mark the anniversary. Preliminary rounds took place in each\ndepartment, with the winners performing once more in the campus\nauditorium. One of my literature classes prepared some scenes from Romeo\nand Juliet, while the other class adapted Kate Chopin’s “Désirée’s Baby” for\nthe stage. Linda played Désirée and Mo Money was the heartless Armand; I\nhelped them practice, along with the Romeo and Juliet group.\nAdam’s Spanish class went to work on Don Quixote. That was a small\nclass—fewer than a dozen students total—and it included some of the\nliveliest third-year boys. They created their own version of Cervantes’s\nnovel, set in Fuling. Don Quixote became an East River noodle shop owner\nwho spent his spare time reading about the fine deeds of Lei Feng, the\nworker-martyr whose selfless dedication to Chairman Mao had made him a\npropaganda fixture since 1963. Lei Feng Spirit was a Communist-style\ncelebration of the banal: he had been a common soldier who showed no\ninterest in either fame or worldly possessions, preferring to labor in silent\nanonymity until the day a comrade accidentally backed a truck into a\nclothesline pole that fell on Lei Feng’s head and killed him (it took the driver\nanother twenty-five years before he was finally admitted into the Party).\nReform and Opening had put a damper on Lei Feng Spirit, although there\nwere a few echoes of the old days. Next to the Fuling stock exchange was a\nbuilding whose original propaganda message, long since removed, was still\nweather-stained clearly onto the white tile: “Study the Lei Feng Spirit.”\n\nMarch was officially Lei Feng Month, although most locals simply laughed if\nyou reminded them of this outdated tradition. But the college still took it\nseriously, assigning mandatory volunteer work to the students in honor of Lei\nFeng. In my second year, one of these March events was a cadre-led cleanup\nof the East River district, which consisted of a television crew filming college\nofficials and students as they pushed dirt to the other side of the street.\nThe East River cleanup took ten minutes, and Adam and I watched it\nfrom the Students’ Home noodle restaurant. It was a Friday afternoon and we\nwere eating Sichuan-style spaghetti and drinking local beer. A couple of our\nstudents came over and asked us to participate in the volunteer effort, so we\ncould be videotaped working alongside the cadres. The students seemed\ndisappointed when we declined.\n“We’re eating lunch,” Adam said, sipping his beer.\n“Anyway, we’re already doing volunteer work right now,” I said. “We’re\nPeace Corps volunteers.”\nThe scene wasn’t exactly Peace Corps brochure material, but it was\nimpossible for us to respond to Lei Feng Spirit with anything other than\ncynicism. The May Fourth anniversary felt much the same way, a shameless\nmanipulation of idealism, and probably these were the forces that gave birth\nto the Spanish class’s play of Don Quixote. But in the end it was impossible\nto tell exactly where the play came from, because Adam gave the students the\nbasic premise—that Don Quixote was an East River noodle shop owner who\nadmired Lei Feng—and from there the students took over, writing the\ndialogue and adding their own details.\nOn the day of the department competition, they were one of the last\ngroups to perform. The play began with Mo Money sitting in his noodle shop,\nreading a book. He stared intently at the pages and then shouted:\n“How wonderful! Look at all the fine deeds that Lei Feng does—every\nday he helps so many people! How I wish I could be like Lei Feng!”\nHe read another page; his eyes grew bigger. He stood up and began to\nmop his restaurant, thinking hard:\n“Why do I spend all of my time working like this? How boring my life is!\nWhat good is it to mop my poor noodle shop when I could be a great hero\nlike Lei Feng?”\nAnd then the idea hit him: he could travel across the countryside,\nperforming great deeds for the people. He turned his mop upside down,\n\nstraddling it like a horse, and he put an old bucket on his head as a helmet.\nOn the wall of the noodle shop was a pinup of a Japanese xiaojie in a\nsundress (you could buy the pictures in downtown Fuling for half a yuan),\nand Mo Money looked at her in rapture:\n“My Dulcinea! I will travel everywhere until I find you!”\nHe turned the portrait into a banner and trotted off into the countryside.\nSoon he passed a peasant toiling in his fields, played by a boy named Roger.\n“Sancho Panza!” Mo Money shouted. “Would you like to come have\nadventures with me?”\nBut Sancho Panza kept working: “No, I have something to do!”\n“Aah, you are very tonto!” Don Quixote said. “Come have adventures\nwith me. We will go to fight injustice like Lei Feng, saving beautiful\nmaidens, and I will introduce you to my number one girl, Dulcinea! Come\non, don’t be a yahoo!”\n“You are the yahoo! I’m too busy to go with you.”\n“So tonto,” muttered Don Quixote. For a moment he stood there thinking\nabout what to offer the peasant. In the novel, Don Quixote promises that he’ll\ngive Sancho Panza the governorship of an island, and Adam had suggested\nthat the student play could use Hainan, the island province in the south of\nChina. But the students had their own ideas about Sancho Panza’s reward.\n“I must have a servant,” Mo Money said. “If you come with me, I will\npromise you…Taiwan Island! I will make you governor of Taiwan Island!”\nWith that, Sancho Panza grabbed a mop and the two of them rode off\ntogether, cantering in perfect time as the audience laughed. Mo Money and\nRoger were both talented actors, and there was an instant chemistry between\nthem. Roger was the quintessential sidekick, a skinny, wide-eyed boy who\nweighed perhaps ninety pounds and listened intently to the Don’s commands.\nAnd Mo Money seemed to have taken lessons from The Great Dictator,\nshouting instructions and carrying an air of mock seriousness.\nTogether they bumbled through the Sichuan countryside, attacking\nwindmills, fighting tigers, and causing trouble in rural inns. At one point they\nstopped to rest and Don Quixote commanded his servant to compose a song\nto Dulcinea. Sancho Panza took his guitar and sang under the Japanese pinup:\nDulcinea!\n\nDulcineeeeeeeaaaa!\nYou are so beautiful…\nWhere is my island?\nMy Taiwan Island…\nBy the time they reached Chongqing, the people had already heard about\ntheir exploits. The Chongqing mayor, played by Lewis, presented them with\nhonorary toothbrushes, secretly pasting signs on their backs that said\n“Tonto,” “Yahoo,” and “Yashua” (toothbrush). The heroes proudly hung the\ntoothbrushes around their necks, and Don Quixote puffed out his chest and\nshouted:\n“I dedicate all of my good deeds to the beautiful Dulcinea! And I hope\nthat everybody begins to do great things like Lei Feng!”\nBy now the student audience was in hysterics. Even the department\nteachers, who sat in the front row as judges for the competition, were\nlaughing helplessly; and the crowd’s energy fed the actors, driving them to\ndash madly across the stage from one adventure to the next. There was no\nquestion that it was by far the best play in the department—but also there was\nno question that the play was treading on risky political ground. Part of the\naudience reaction seemed to say: I can’t believe I’m hearing this. To some\ndegree I felt the same way, and at the end of the performance I found myself\nwatching Party Secretary Zhang. It was hard to tell what he was thinking—he\nwas smiling and laughing softly, but I could see the wheels turning in his\nhead. And in the end he represented the only judge who really mattered.\nIT TOOK THE DEPARTMENT authorities a day to react. They banned\nDon Quixote; five other plays were chosen to be performed in the campus\nauditorium, including “Désirée’s Baby.” There were never any appeals to\ndecisions like this, and the department made it clear that political issues were\ninvolved.\nBut for some reason the students, who usually kept their grumbling quiet,\nwere openly angry. Even the ones who had produced Romeo and Juliet\nmuttered darkly that their play had also been denied for political reasons,\n\nbecause the title actors were real-life boyfriend and girlfriend, which was\nagainst the college’s anti-romance regulation (the most ignored rule on\ncampus). The strongest reaction, though, was from the Spanish students, who\nrefused to accept the department command. Mo Money angrily confronted\nthe department’s assistant political adviser, threatening that if Don Quixote\nwas blacklisted he would also pull out of “Désirée’s Baby.” Quickly it\nbecame a serious problem: the authorities didn’t want their competition to fall\napart, and they liked the politics of the Kate Chopin story, which criticized\nAmerican racism.\nAnd so it went with the anniversary celebration of the May Fourth\nMovement. In many ways I felt the department, and by proxy the Party, got\nexactly what it deserved. If you tried to politicize everything, turning every\npiece of literature and every scrap of history to your purposes, then at a\ncertain point it was bound to blow up in your face. After two years I was sick\nof the countless anniversaries and commemorations; I was tired of the twisted\nhistory; and I had had enough of our propaganda-laced textbooks.\nBut at the same time, Adam felt guilty, and even though it wasn’t my\nclass I felt the same way, because there was no question that our influence\nhad led the students into trouble. If we hadn’t been there, they wouldn’t have\nbeen performing Don Quixote and “Désirée’s Baby” (and without our\ninfluence there certainly would not have been a Communist Party Member\nwith the English name Mo Money). It was different from the other parts of\nour lives, in which we watched Fuling from a distance. We had a direct effect\non these students, and we had always encouraged them to be open-minded,\nquestioning, and irreverent. Some of this had been intentional—the debates\nabout Robin Hood, the conversations in Chinese—but mostly it was a matter\nof our fundamental identity. We were waiguoren, and we didn’t have that\nvoice in the back of our minds that warned us when certain lines were being\ncrossed. We had lived in Fuling long enough to affect some of the people, but\nnot long enough to internalize all of the rules; and this transitional state, like\nthe half-baked history of the May Fourth anniversary, led to risky politics.\nIt also seemed clear that even though the play had dealt with subjects that\nusually weren’t associated with laughter, the students hadn’t intended to be\nsubversive in any serious way. Mo Money, after all, was both a Party\nMember and the class monitor, and any violation had simply been the result\nof everybody’s losing track of the play as a whole. The subject matter came\n\nfrom too many directions at once: Adam had proposed the references to Lei\nFeng, and the students had come up with Taiwan, and all of the silly words\nthat they loved had come from many contexts over the course of the year.\nProbably their biggest mistake was focusing too much on Don Quixote Spirit.\nThey tried to be faithful to Cervantes’s novel, applying its satirical bent to\nFuling life, and they attempted to be as entertaining as possible. But both\nsatire and entertainment were risky endeavors in a Communist system, which\ndepends on the sort of control that ruins good comedy.\nMostly there was something disappointing about the pettiness. None of it\nhad any larger significance beyond whatever knowledge the students were\nable to acquire in their enthusiasm, and a counterrevolution was not going to\nstart with Don Quixote (although, by coincidence, some of the important\ndissident meetings of 1989 had taken place under Beijing University’s statue\nof Cervantes). But in any case it seemed clear that if Communist China was\ngoing to crumble, the collapse was not going to begin here in Fuling with a\ngroup of peasant-students clowning around on mops. It was pathetic that\nsomebody couldn’t watch the play and simply laugh; it was unquestionably\nfunny, but even intelligent, well-educated people like Party Secretary Zhang\nwere always listening to that voice in the back of their minds: Should I laugh\nat this? Is it really funny? Or is it offensive and dangerous? In some ways this\nwas what I had grown to loathe the most about Communism. I could almost\nbear the falseness and the lies, but I could not forgive its complete absence of\nhumor. China was a grim place once you took the laughter away.\nAdam and I encouraged Mo Money and the other students to work things\nout without causing more problems, but other than that we weren’t involved\nin the negotiations. As the week passed and the students gave us regular\nreports on these meetings, I began to see why the Don had struck such a\nchord. He was the perfect Chinese character, the poor knight with his\noutdated ideals and heart of gold. I saw flashes of him in everybody involved:\nhe was Mo Money and his hopeless play, but at the same time he was also\nParty Secretary Zhang and his hopeless political faith. When I thought about\nit, Party Secretary Zhang was just doing whatever he could to hold the line,\njust as others had held it before him, and probably he didn’t enjoy this\nparticular aspect of his job. Earlier in the semester his daughter had died and\nhis wife had just given birth to a son; he had bigger issues to worry about, but\nregulating the students’ politics was his job, and so he did it. Everybody was\n\ntilting at windmills and I really couldn’t blame any of them.\nAfter a few days they made a compromise. There would be a special final\nperformance of Don Quixote, strictly for the English department, with all of\nthe politically sensitive material vetted and purged. This satisfied everybody\n—“Désirée’s Baby” would continue as planned, and the Spanish class would\nget a final chance to perform in front of their friends, although they weren’t\nallowed to appear in the campus auditorium. Once again Adam helped them\npractice and rework the script.\nAt the end of the week, all of us gathered to watch the second\nperformance of Don Quixote. In some ways the play was a letdown; it lacked\nthe energy of the original, and a few times the actors became nervous,\nstumbling over their lines. The problem wasn’t so much that important\nmaterial had been lost, but rather that too much had been added: the play had\nacquired incredible symbolic weight in the course of a week. During the first\nstaging, nobody had thought too much about what it meant to refer to Lei\nFeng and Taiwan. Now some of the looseness that makes good comedy was\nlost; the banned references were conspicuous by their absence, and the\nstudents were worn out from a week of negotiating with the authorities.\nBut nothing could completely ruin the slapstick of the two heroes, and\nonce again the crowd enjoyed it. The play ended in mock sadness, the duo\nseparated by Don Quixote’s decision to retire to his noodle restaurant. Mo\nMoney rode his mop slowly home, hanging his head, while the theme song\nfrom Titanic played mournfully in the background.\nWilliam Jefferson Foster was the play’s narrator, and after the final scene\nhe stood up to read the postscript. But as he spoke, Adam and I realized that\nhe was departing from the prepared text, reading something that he had\nwritten himself. He was always heading off on his own like this; often in\nclass I’d see William Jefferson Foster with his nose buried in the dictionary,\nand then during the ten-minute break he’d sidle up to me and say, with\ncareful pronunciation, “How is your premature ejaculation?”\nMuch of his extracurricular studies was along these lines, and he was\nalways trying out some new obscenity or perverted phrase. It was childish,\nbut at the same time he was one of the best students in the class, and I could\nsee that much of his English skill came from the pleasure he gained from\nmanipulating the language. He took English in his own direction, using it as\nhe pleased, and I liked that. I also liked that he had grown up in a poor\n\npeasant home not far from Guang’an, Deng Xiaoping’s hometown, and yet\nnow he had given himself a ludicrously pretentious WASP name.\nAt the end of Don Quixote, William Jefferson Foster veered off on his\nown once more. Standing there in front of the department he read his own\nconclusion:\nDon went back to his noodle shop, and Sancho went back to his farm\nto raise hogs in order to support his tuition, hoping that he could get the\ndegree in Oxford University. Meanwhile Don taught himself and got the\nbachelor’s degree in Penn University. Later the two crazy men travelled\nto China and became two English teachers, also the most famous\nYahoos in Fuling.\nHe spoke quickly and none of the cadres caught it. Afterward he looked\nup at Adam and me, to see if we had understood, and then he grinned. The\nplay was over.\nTHE NEXT MORNING, Adam and I woke up early to do some filming\ndowntown. For three days we had had access to a video camera, because the\nPeace Corps medical officer was making a site visit and she had brought the\noffice film equipment. It was the first time anybody from the Peace Corps\nstaff had come to Fuling since the week we arrived in the city.\nFor three days we tried to capture everything about Fuling that we wanted\nto remember. We filmed the students’ performance of Don Quixote, and we\nmade trips to the countryside and the parts of old town that we liked. Much of\nthe tape consisted of short conversations with friends: the family at the\nStudents’ Home, the priest, the people who worked in the restaurants,\nteahouses, and parks where we had spent so much time. We took a cab ride\nand asked the driver to go as fast as possible while I pointed the camera out\nthe window, filming the traffic as it flashed past in a chorus of honks.\nOn the morning that the Peace Corps medical officer was leaving, we\ndecided to do one final shooting before returning the camera. We were\ndowntown by seven o’clock, filming a group of elderly people as they did\n\ntheir taiji routines in South Mountain Gate Park, and then we took the\nstaircases down toward the docks so we could get some typical street scenes.\nIt was difficult to film average street life because it always stopped the\nmoment we arrived. The camera was bulky, an expensive model that was\nessentially the same size as what a television reporter might use, and crowds\nalways gathered and stared. Apart from conversations with friends, much of\nour Fuling footage consisted of locals and stick-stick soldiers gaping at the\ncamera.\nDown near the docks I quickly found myself surrounded by a crowd.\nNeither Adam nor I had spent much time in this area; there were no teahouses\nor restaurants where we knew the workers. Many of the people who gathered\nhadn’t seen us before, and we told them that we were local teachers who were\nfilming as a hobby.\nAdam decided to create a diversion. He drifted a few feet down the street,\nstopping to buy a steamed bun from a streetside vendor. They bargained for a\nwhile and the crowd started to shift, and then Adam joked with the woman\nand she laughed, covering her mouth. Slowly I started to move backward,\nhoping to separate myself from the crowd. Twenty people gathered around\nAdam, then thirty, forty. A few cabs stopped to stare; traffic backed up.\nHorns honked. I crossed the street quickly and then I was alone, filming\nAdam in the center of the crowd. Everybody had forgotten that I was there.\nIt was the sort of scene that at one point had been terrifying—there was\nnothing more intimidating during the first year than standing in the center of\na mass of people, all of them studying me with incredible intensity. But rarely\nwere these groups anything but curious, and over time, like the other\nwaiguoren who lived in rural Sichuan cities, Adam and I learned how to\nwork the crowds. I always smiled and stayed relaxed, usually focusing on a\nsingle bystander: he would ask questions and I would answer while the rest of\nthe people listened. Usually I told them my salary, and what I did in Fuling,\nand I answered their questions about America. To make the crowd laugh, I\ncould use the dialect or refer to myself as a foreign devil. It was like being a\npolitician in a benevolent environment, handling a press conference at which\nthe theme was simply curiosity.\nThere was a certain power to those moments, because it was a remarkable\nthing to hold the attention of forty people who had dropped whatever they\nwere doing simply to see you. This morning the crowd continued to swell\n\naround Adam. More than fifty people gathered close, laughing at his jokes.\nHe offered a bun to a passing cab. He bought two more buns from the woman\nand began to juggle. Another battalion of stick-stick soldiers rushed across\nthe street to join the spectators. I zoomed in with the camera, focusing on\nfaces—the smiling bun vendor, the young shopkeepers who had come out\ninto the street, the worn visages of the stick-stick soldiers, their faces broken\ninto grins as they watched the waiguoren.\nAdam dropped a bun. He picked it up and tossed it across the street\ntoward me. He pointed me out, and the people laughed, turning back to Adam\nas he told another joke. Slowly I panned across the faces once more, and then\nsuddenly the viewfinder went black.\nSomething pushed me backward and I took a step to regain my balance. I\nstill had my eye on the viewfinder and it went black once more, and this time\nI was pushed back harder. I looked up and a man was standing in front of me,\nwaving his leather money bag.\n“You can’t do this,” he said. “You can’t film here.”\n“Who are you?” I asked.\nHe repeated his command, and I repeated my question. I was still filming,\nthe camera on my shoulder.\n“I’m a citizen,” he said. “You can’t do this. It’s illegal.”\nHe swung his bag once more, harder this time, and I felt my anger rise.\n“Stop hitting the camera,” I said. “Who are you?”\n“I’m a citizen,” he said again. He had a thick local accent and he stepped\nclose, threateningly. He was a big man with a belly and a shock of greasy hair\nand a round face that shone with anger. There were certain things about him\nthat I recognized immediately—from his accent I knew that he wasn’t\neducated, and something in the way he dressed and carried himself told me\nthat he had a position of some authority, perhaps as a minor government\ncadre or a lower-level factory boss. He was in his late forties—of that age\ngroup known as the “Lost Generation,” because they had grown up during the\nCultural Revolution.\n“I’m a citizen,” he said once more.\n“I’m a citizen, too,” I said. “I live here in Fuling. I teach at the teachers\ncollege. There’s nothing illegal about filming here.”\nHe swung again at the camera, hitting it. I stepped forward.\n“Leave me alone,” I said. “I’m not doing anything wrong. Get out of\n\nhere. Blow away.”\nThe last phrase caught him. His eyes widened.\n“What did you say?”\n“I told you to blow away,” I said. “Who do you think you are? You can’t\njust come up and hit somebody for no reason at all. Why do you have to be so\nrude?”\nI used the harsh word for rudeness, culu, and again it caught him.\n“You can’t film here,” he shouted. “You’re not teachers—you’re\nreporters. And you can’t throw things on the street like he just did. You\nshould show more respect, and you shouldn’t be here.”\n“I’ve been here for two years,” I said. “We’re just teachers, and we’re\nfilming because we want to remember Fuling. You shouldn’t be so rude.”\nBy now a crowd was gathering around us, murmuring, pressing close. A\nwoman was with the man and she began to shout at me, jabbing her finger in\nthe air. I was still filming but I held the camera low against my side. Adam\nhurried over from the other side of the street, trying to explain that we were\nteachers. But by now the woman and the man were shouting angrily, and the\ncrowd’s murmurs were growing louder, and I realized that we were in\ntrouble. Nobody was smiling anymore. I turned the camera off. The crowd\ngrew.\nOF EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENED during my two years in Fuling, I\nreviewed that incident the most times. It couldn’t be avoided; that was one of\nthe most troubling moments I ever had in the city, and it was on tape.\nI did not enjoy watching the video. Every time I saw it, something tensed\nin my stomach and I could feel my pulse race. I watched the smiling faces as\nAdam juggled and joked around, and I told myself that the people were\nobviously happy. I thought about all the days I had spent in the city, all the\ncrowds I had encountered, and all the times nothing had happened. And I\nremembered the incident when the shoeshine man had bothered me and the\npeople had stood up in my defense.\nBut always when I watched the video I silently urged it forward, waiting\nfor the man to appear on the screen. He came in from the left, long after\nAdam had drawn the crowd, but unlike the others the man and his wife stood\n\napart, a few feet away from the pack. They watched Adam for half a minute,\nand then the man turned to look at me. He crossed the street and walked\ntoward me, striding purposefully off the side of the screen, and then suddenly\neverything went black.\nThere was much that the video showed. Most painfully, it showed the\nmistakes that we had made, starting with drawing a crowd in a part of town\nthat we didn’t know well. It also showed that Adam had been too nonchalant,\nmilking the attention, and it showed that he had been disrespectful in tossing\nthe bun across the street. It showed that I was far too quick to anger and use\nstrong language; from the tape it seemed that the man might have left me\nalone if I hadn’t insulted him.\nBut at the same time there was much missing from the tape, which was\nprobably what made it the most unpleasant to watch. None of the background\nwas there—nothing could show how we had dealt with so many crowds in\nthe past that we were overconfident, and nothing could explain that\nconfidence and looseness were the best ways to deal with that aspect of life in\nFuling. The worst reaction was to fear the crowds or wish that they wouldn’t\nappear; you had to accept that you were an anomaly, and that people were\ngoing to gather to stare and listen to you talk. If you let this bother you, it\nwould make you miserable, the same way that there was no point in worrying\nabout the noise and the pollution.\nAnd always the key was to avoid taking yourself seriously. To be\nsuccessful you laughed at yourself, talking of “us foreign devils,” and you\nmade a sloppy and hilarious imitation of the dialect. If you felt an urge to\njuggle, you juggled. It was like something that Adam used to say before he\nwent into town to practice Chinese: “Well, now it’s time to be a buffoon for\nthe next two hours.”\nThe tape also said nothing about all of the baggage that accompanied a\nwaiguoren holding a camera in China. In 1972, when there were virtually no\nforeigners in the country, Zhou Enlai invited the Italian filmmaker\nMichelangelo Antonioni to make a documentary about China. It was a\ncontroversial invitation; Mao’s wife, Jiang Qing, and other conservatives in\nthe government opposed it, but Zhou believed that a Westerner could make a\nfilm about China that would appeal to the outside world. Antonioni was\nsympathetic to the Chinese government, but his final product enraged\nofficials, who accused him of deliberately trying to make China look poor.\n\nMost famously, Jiang Qing pointed out that his shot of the Nanjing Bridge\nincluded a workers’ laundry line in the foreground.\nThis was precisely what the Chinese expected of a foreigner—only a\nwaiguoren would visit a modern bridge and come away with the image of a\nclothesline, making the country look poor. Although Antonioni denied\nstrenuously that his intentions had been to criticize China, a 1974 propaganda\ncampaign focused on the incident, turning it into a textbook example of the\nway waiguoren came to China and searched for the negative aspects. I had\nmet older people in Sichuan and Xi’an who were familiar with this story, and\nas a result I had learned to be careful with my camera in Fuling. More than\nonce somebody had accused me of trying to show the bad side of local life.\nBut all of our experience failed Adam and me while we videotaped. The\ncamera showed our mistakes with an embarrassing clarity, but it didn’t show\neverything that happened before the man confronted me, and it didn’t show\nwhat happened after I turned the camera off. And perhaps what bothered me\nthe most was that I watched the tape more than a dozen times, but never\ncould I tell the precise moment when the crowd turned against us. I had\nalways been fascinated by that elusive but definite shift, the quicksilver\ninstant when a Fuling crowd became a mob, but in the end it remained a\nmystery. Even the camera couldn’t capture it.\nTHE MOB GREW. I turned the camera off. Adam was at my side and both\nof us were trying to explain at once. The man and his wife were still at the\nheart of the mob, and I could hear the man saying over and over that we were\nreporters who had no respect for the city. But by now he wasn’t the only one\ntalking. Others pressed forward, shouting and gesturing angrily, and it was\nhard to understand what they were saying. The buzz of the mob rose, shifting\ninto a roar.\nI felt my anger turn to fear, and now Adam and I were trying to be\nconciliatory, apologizing and emphasizing that we were teachers who meant\nno harm. But it was too late for explanations; nobody was listening and\nbystanders were jostling in their effort to see what was happening. Somebody\nbrushed against my back. I wrapped both hands around the camera and held it\nin front of me. More people were shouting, their faces hard with anger.\n\n“We need to get the hell out of here,” I said to Adam. I started to leave,\ndropping my head and holding the camera carefully, but nobody budged. The\nman’s wife stood directly in front of me. I felt somebody clutching at my\narm.\n“We’re leaving,” I said in Chinese. The woman made no reply. She didn’t\nmove and now there was a horrible smile on her face—a combination of\nanger and joy as she saw us get what we deserved.\n“Jesus,” I said. “They won’t let me out.”\n“Follow me,” Adam said. He was carrying the camera case, an enormous\nmetal box, and now he held it before him. Hands grabbed at him, but he\nshook them off and kept walking, his size and the bulk of the box forcing the\nmob to give way. Somebody tore at my arm. I cradled the camera as I pressed\nclose to Adam’s back. I felt a kick glance off my leg, and then another blow\nstruck me hard on the thigh. We were free of the mob now, starting to run,\nand I turned quickly to see who had kicked me. But all I saw was a pack of\nblurred faces. We hurried down the street. I didn’t look back again.\nNOTHING HAPPENED AS A RESULT of the incident. Somebody called\nthe college to report the confrontation, and the college waiban called the\nPeace Corps. The waiban said nothing about whether Adam and I had been in\nthe wrong; they simply asked if the camera was all right, and the Peace Corps\nsaid there were no problems. We had told the medical officer about the\nincident before she left Fuling.\nAdam and I talked about it with Noreen and Sunni, but we didn’t tell\nanybody else in Fuling. Together we watched the tape a lot. Nearly all of the\nfootage consisted of pleasant everyday scenes—the rivers and the\ncountryside; our students and our friends—but mostly we watched the part\nwith the crowd. It was as if we were looking for some insight that we could\ntake away from the experience, something that would explain the\nunpleasantness, but there were no neat revelations. All it showed was a blunt\nuseless truth about life on the streets of Fuling: after two years we were still\nwaiguoren, both in the way we acted and in the way the people saw us.\nThere was nothing to do about that now, and we recovered as best we\ncould. Fortunately we left town for a few days, because there were some\n\nPeace Corps administrative matters to take care of in Chengdu, and after\nreturning to Fuling I tried not to think too much about the incident. In some\nways avoiding the memory wasn’t as hard as I had expected, because already\nthere were many things like that in the river town. You knew they were there,\nbut you tried not to think about them too much.\nI went to town during the evenings, just as I always had. I still felt\ncomfortable when people pressed close to see me, and the people were still\nfriendly. Nothing had changed. It was both comforting and disheartening to\nrealize that in some ways things were the same as they always had been.\nJUNE WAS A BUSY MONTH, and I tried to start the goodbyes early, so\nthere wouldn’t be such a rush at the end.\nQian Manli and Wang Dongmei were two young women from the local\nBank of China who had always been particularly helpful, so Adam and I\nasked them out for hot pot on a Friday night. It was the first date of any sort\nI’d had in two years of living in Fuling.\nWe met them on Gaosuntang. Both of them had dressed carefully—very\nshort skirts, very bright makeup, silk blouses, highlights in their hair. We\nhadn’t expected that; Adam and I were wearing T-shirts and baseball caps.\nThe best hot pot places were on Xinghua Road, winding down toward the\ncenter of town, and the four of us walked past the open-air restaurants that\nlined the sidewalk. It was a warm night, with hundreds of people eating\noutside, and all of them stared as we walked past. Qian Manli and Wang\nDongmei were very pretty women in their mid-twenties, and it was clear that\nthey enjoyed the attention of going out with the waiguoren—in fact, this\nappeared to be why they had prepared themselves so elaborately.\nWe chose a restaurant and took a table on the sidewalk. There was a hush\nas we arrived. The women ordered for us, and Adam and I started one of our\nChinese routines, referring to each other as foreign devils, running dogs, and\nCapitalist Roaders. Wang Dongmei and Qian Manli laughed, as everybody\nalways did when we peppered our conversation with Cultural Revolution\ninsults and anti-foreigner remarks. We ordered local beer and it was nice to\neat on the sidewalk, chatting and watching the crowd.\nThe incident with the video camera seemed far away, and I realized that\n\none thing I would never forget about Fuling was its unpredictability—the\nway things could change so quickly, a bad day followed by a good week. The\ntown wasn’t simple, and neither was my role there; it would be wrong to say\nthat I had failed in my efforts to make Fuling a comfortable home, and it\nwould be just as inaccurate to claim that I had been entirely successful. There\nwere good days and there were bad days. To some degree this was what I\nliked most about Fuling: it was a human place, brightened by decency and\nscarred by flaws, and a town like that was always engaging. For two years I\nhad never been bored.\nToday was one of the good days, and sitting there at the hot pot restaurant\nI felt completely comfortable with everything, the language and the crowd\nand the women at our table. It wasn’t much different from a Friday night at\nhome, hanging out with friends and joking around. And I liked the fact that\nAdam and I were also comfortable with each other’s Chinese personalities—\nHo Wei and Mei Zhiyuan were just as close as our other identities. It seemed\nages since our first semester, when we had avoided going into town together\nbecause it doubled the harassment.\nAfter an hour I got up to use the bathroom, and I returned to find Adam\nand Wang Dongmei talking loudly.\n“You’re not married!” Adam said.\n“Yes, I am,” she said, laughing. “I was married two months ago.”\n“You’re joking!”\n“No, it’s true.”\n“But you never said anything about getting married!”\n“You didn’t ask.”\n“You can’t be serious—you’re lying to me.”\nBut she seemed sincere. I turned to Qian Manli. “Are you married?”\n“Yes.”\n“I don’t believe it!”\n“It’s true,” she said, smiling. She had a nice smile and very pretty black\neyes, and I realized that in Fuling a woman like this would never make it past\ntwenty-five without marrying. I had been a fool for ever thinking otherwise.\n“Where’s your husband?” I asked.\n“He’s at home.”\n“What’s he doing?”\n“I don’t know. Probably watching television.”\n\nIt was the same way with Wang Dongmei. Both of them were newlyweds\nwho had left their husbands at home on a Friday night to go out with the\nwaiguoren.\nI glanced over at Adam. At the beginning of the evening we had\npromised the women that we wouldn’t speak any English, but now we didn’t\nneed to; each of us knew what the other was thinking. Regardless of how\ncomfortable certain moments were in the city, life still wasn’t normal, and\nnever would be. That had always been part of Fuling’s charm and there was\nno reason to be surprised by it now.\nWe stayed for another two hours. The best aspect of eating hot pot was\nthat it took so long—it was a slow, lazy meal, perfect for a warm night out on\nthe sidewalk. The restaurant had cold beer and we ordered a few. Everybody\nhad a good time. After dinner we walked the women back to their apartment\nbuildings. I was hoping that they would invite us inside, so we could meet\ntheir husbands—sort of like meeting a girl’s parents when you went out in\nhigh school. But they just smiled and waved goodbye, and we caught a cab\nback to the college.\nTEACHER LIAO WAS PREGNANT; she was due in July. In June she\ninvited Adam and me to a farewell dinner. She gave us some calligraphy that\nhad been written by her father-in-law, who was famous for his brushwork,\nand we gave her some baby clothes.\nA couple of evenings earlier, the college authorities had invited all four of\nthe foreign teachers and our tutors to a banquet. Mr. Wang, the waiban\nrepresentative, had always enjoyed making fun of Adam’s and my Chinese,\nspeaking with patronizing slowness and accusing us of not understanding. He\nsat at my table during the banquet, mocking me mercilessly, until finally\nTeacher Liao snapped at him.\n“Ho Wei understands what you’re saying!” she said. “We studied that a\nyear ago. You don’t need to talk to him like that!”\nMr. Wang laughed lightly, as he always did; but the point had been made,\nand I took great pleasure in watching this tiny pregnant woman set the cadre\nstraight. It reminded me of the way she had defended Li Peng during our\ntutorial a year ago—it was the same fierce pride, and, despite being indirectly\n\nlinked with Li Peng, I was happy to share in her loyalty.\nShe knew that I didn’t like Mr. Wang because that spring I had been very\nopen with her about my feelings regarding the waiban and the English\ndepartment. Teacher Liao’s final assignment had been to summarize my\nexperience in Fuling, and I spent our last two classes doing that. I was blunt\n—I told her about the things I didn’t like, the administration’s pettiness and\nthe mocking catcalls in town, and never once did she try to defend any of it.\nBut I spent most of the time talking about the good things that had happened\nin Fuling, and I said that by far my best experience had been learning Chinese\nand meeting people in the city. I told her that in particular I respected the way\nthat she and Teacher Kong had extended their friendship as well as their\npatience; others wouldn’t have done the same.\nThose classes ended in May, because of her pregnancy. My office was on\nthe sixth floor of the teaching building, and I strongly recommended that for\nour final tutorials we meet in her apartment, or someplace else that was more\nconvenient. She was not a physically strong woman, and it tired her to climb\nall the way up to my office.\nBut until the end she was very Chinese—it was appropriate for us to meet\nin my office, and so that was where we had class. This had nothing to do with\nstairs or pregnancy; it was simply how things were done. It was the Chinese\nway.\nIn early May we had my last tutorial. She struggled up the steps, gasping\nfor breath, and I gave her a couple of minutes to recover. As was true of so\nmany Chinese women, most of her body remained thin throughout the\npregnancy—it was as if somebody had sewn an awkward bundle onto her\nstomach. Finally she stopped wheezing and we began class.\nAfter thirty minutes she suddenly sat bolt upright, puffed out her cheeks,\nand rushed out the door. I could hear her getting sick in the spittoon outside\nmy office, and then she hurried down the hallway to the bathroom.\nI waited for her to return. A year ago, I would have assumed that she\nwould cancel class, but now I knew better—we would finish the two hours\ntoday. I knew exactly how she would act when she returned, and what she\nwould say. And I knew that I would always remember this woman’s quiet\npride and toughness, and the way it had gone from being infuriating to\nsomething whose consistency was admirable and even comforting.\nFive minutes later she came back. She smiled, blushed, and said,\n\n“Duibuqi. Sorry.”\n“Do you want to stop class?” I asked.\n“No. It is nothing—often at this time in the morning I am a little sick.”\n“Certainly we don’t have to finish today if you feel poorly.”\n“It is nothing,” she said firmly. “Now—please continue with what you\nwere saying before I left.”\nAnd I did.\nI HAD MADE SOME MONEY from a story I had written for the Los\nAngeles Times, and I donated the payment to the Fuling Catholic church. I\nknew that Father Li had been looking for some extra cash so he could have a\nmural painted on a new wall in the courtyard, and he thanked me when I\nmade the donation.\n“Thank you for your kindness to me,” I said, shaking the old man’s hand.\nWe were sitting in his office, with the poster of Mao and Deng on the wall.\nFather Li gripped my hand tightly.\n“We’ll remember you after you’re gone,” he said. “I’ll say a Mass for\nyou.”\n“Thank you,” I said, and then I thought of something. “Could you also\nsay a Mass for my grandfather?”\n“Certainly. Write his name here.”\nHe handed me a piece of paper and I wrote my grandfather’s name: Frank\nAnselm Dietz. Anselm was the holy name that he had chosen when he\nbecame a Benedictine monk. I wrote it carefully and gave the paper back to\nthe priest.\n“When my grandfather was young, he was a monk in Rome,” I said. “He\nwanted to come here to China.” I had told Father Li this before, but for some\nreason it seemed important that I repeat it now.\n“Rome is a very beautiful city,” said the priest.\n“Yes, it is,” I said. “I’ve been there before.”\n“I’ve never gone,” he said, chuckling to himself.\n“My grandfather didn’t become a priest. But I think he would like it very\nmuch if you said a Mass for him here in Fuling.”\n“I’ll do that,” Father Li said, nodding.\n\n“Thank you very much,” I said. “I’ll come back sometime and see the\nnew wall.”\n“You will always be welcome here.”\nHe walked with me into the courtyard, where high walls kept out the\nnoise of the city. Flowers were growing around the Four Modernizations\nsign. It was a hot afternoon. I was thinking about my grandfather and the old\npriest, and suddenly I was so sad that I couldn’t say anything else. Silently I\nshook his hand and turned to leave.\n“Manman zou,” he said. “Go slowly.” But I walked quickly out of the\ncourtyard and into the roar of the city.\nI GAVE THE LITERATURE STUDENTS their final examination during\nthe last week. Linda’s father was very sick now, and she took the test a few\nhours early so she could catch a noon bus home. I offered to let her take it\nlater, or not at all; she had always been one of the best students and the news\nabout her father had not sounded good. But she insisted on taking the test\nbefore leaving Fuling.\nLater that afternoon I supervised the rest of the students during the\nscheduled exam. As always, they were nervous and worked seriously,\nalthough I noticed that one girl, Susan, seemed distracted. She was very pale\nand spent most of the second hour with her head on the desk.\nI didn’t think much of it until later. It was Adam’s birthday and after the\nexam we had a banquet for all the students at a local restaurant. Everybody\ndrank too much and it was a good night, spilling over to the Students’ Home,\nwhere Feng Xiaoqin served us more beer.\nAt some point during the evening, Mo Money told me that Linda’s father\nhad died while she was taking my examination. The fortune-tellers had been\nright; and now I wished that I had insisted she take the test some other time.\nThe following day Susan disappeared from the college. The story came\nout gradually, in bits and pieces. Four days earlier she had had an abortion,\nand the night before the examination she had been taken to the emergency\nroom because of complications. Somehow it had been kept secret up to that\npoint; my impression was that she had found some sort of illegal private\ndoctor, although this wasn’t clear. All we knew for certain was that her\n\nemergency-room trip had alerted the college authorities, and now they knew\nthe truth, which was why she had left. Students were expelled whenever they\nwere caught having sexual relations, not to mention getting pregnant. And a\nnote was attached to their dangan—the dossiers that followed them wherever\nthey went in China. If Susan ever took a danwei job of any sort, her superiors\nwould know what had happened to her.\nGroups of girl students talked quietly in the hallways, their faces drawn.\nThe night after Susan left, I ran into Sarah and Lisa outside my office. They\nwere serious and we spoke in Chinese, standing on the landing overlooking\nthe city. I asked about Susan, and Lisa looked at me carefully.\n“Do you know what happened to her?” she said.\n“Yes.”\n“How do you know?”\n“Other students have told me.”\n“What do you think about it?”\n“I think it’s very sad, of course. And I think she should be allowed to\ngraduate.”\n“That won’t happen,” Lisa said quickly. She was one of the better\nstudents and also one of the more thoughtful. I asked her if Susan had gone\nhome, and Lisa shook her head.\n“She can’t go home,” she said. “Her father is very angry.”\n“How does he know?”\n“The college told him. When the authorities found out, at first they\nagreed not to tell her family. But for some reason they told. This same thing\nhappened to Susan’s older sister a few years ago, and when her father found\nout he beat her. So now Susan will not go home. Her father is very angry—\nit’s a big loss of face for the family. This is the second time they have lost\nface in such a way.”\n“Do you think the department should have told him?” I asked.\n“I don’t think it’s their affair. It’s a private matter.”\nI told her that I agreed, and I asked how Susan’s boyfriend was treating\nher.\n“He is fine. She has good guanxi with his parents and I think they will\nhelp her. Perhaps that is where she has gone. But you know, she paid several\nthousand yuan to get a teaching job in his hometown, but now she won’t\ngraduate and she’ll lose the job. She’ll lose the money, too.”\n\nThat didn’t seem to be the biggest concern—to be honest, I was far more\nworried about Susan jumping off a bridge. But I said nothing about that.\n“This sort of thing happens everywhere,” I said. “In America it’s very\ncommon as well.”\n“What do people do about the problem there?”\n“It’s very difficult, just as it is here, but usually it can be kept private.\nProbably that is the biggest difference.”\n“That’s the way it should be. But here everybody knows—the whole\ncollege has heard about it.”\n“What do most people think?”\n“A few people think it’s funny; others think she’s a bad woman. But most\nof the students in our class are very sorry for Susan, although we can’t help.”\nShe shook her head and gazed out on the rivers. “Mei banfa,” she said.\n“There is nothing that can be done.”\nTHE NEXT DAY I turned twenty-nine years old. Always in the past my\nbirthdays had felt like somebody else’s—it seemed impossible that I had\nreally gained another year. But this time I knew that I was twenty-nine; in\nsome ways I felt much older. It had been a long two years and during that\ntime I hadn’t left western China.\nIn the morning I went with Adam and Mo Money to the bus station,\nbecause Linda had asked us to meet her when she returned. She wore a black\narmband and her eyes were red. After getting off the bus she tried to smile,\none of those brave Chinese smiles that held the emotion at bay, compressed\nand controlled and pushed to the peripheries—a corner of the mouth, a line\nacross the forehead. But today the sadness was too much; her mouth\ntrembled, and she looked away.\nThat evening I graded my literature examinations. I thought about how\npleasant everything had seemed when I monitored the exam, walking through\nthe rows of students with their heads down, working hard. I liked being\nsurrounded by their silence and concentration, and I liked the way that all of\nthe black-haired heads were bent seriously. There was a simplicity to the\nscene, and there was a similar simplicity to the examination, which had\nnothing to do with the complications of life in Fuling, or the political\n\nproblems in China, or the nationwide struggle of Reform and Opening. It was\nsimply a literature test.\nFor the final section I asked them to analyze Robert Frost’s “Nothing\nGold Can Stay”:\nNature’s first green is gold,\nHer hardest hue to hold.\nHer early leaf’s a flower;\nBut only so an hour.\nThen leaf subsides to leaf.\nSo Eden sank to grief,\nSo dawn goes down to day.\nNothing gold can stay.\nWe had studied the poem back in May. I had lectured in detail about its\nrhythm—I always did that, because the students liked analyzing the sound of\nthe language and you could take a poem apart without boring them. Most of\nthem had understood what I said about Frost, and it was one of those classes\nthat made me feel good about teaching literature. During the exam I felt the\nsame way, walking through the rows and watching them work.\nBut now I realized that the simplicity had been a mirage. Linda’s father\nhad been dying as she took her final exam, and Susan had been struggling\nwith the fear that had now driven her from the college. That was the way so\nmany things in Fuling turned out—even teaching, which seemed to be a\nstraightforward job, was complex and uncertain. There was an unemotional\nveneer that the people presented to the outside world, especially to\nwaiguoren, and this made it harder when you lived there long enough to\ncatch a glimpse of the way things actually worked. Of course, to some degree\nit was just the difficulties of life anywhere in the world—during my time in\nFuling, two students had died; another student had an abortion and was\nexpelled; a father died; a child died; people’s marriages crumbled. Those\nthings happened everywhere. But in Fuling it had taken me longer to see that\nside of life, because at first as a waiguoren I was held at a distance, and in a\nway that distance was hardest to deal with once it was gone. It was like\n\nlooking at a blank meaningless smile and suddenly recognizing a lifetime of\nsadness concentrated in the corner.\nI had never had any idealistic illusions about my Peace Corps “service” in\nChina; I wasn’t there to save anybody or leave an indelible mark on the town.\nIf anything, I was glad that during my two years in Fuling I hadn’t built\nanything, or organized anything, or made any great changes to the place. I\nhad been a teacher, and in my spare time I had tried to learn as much as\npossible about the city and its people. That was the extent of my work, and I\nwas comfortable with those roles and I recognized their limitations.\nBut now I found myself wondering if anything would be left from those\nhours in class. I hoped that my students would remember that Frost poem, or\nsomething else that we had studied. It could be something as small as a single\ncharacter from a story, or a sliver from a Shakespeare sonnet—but I hoped\nthat something would be remembered. I hoped that they would keep it\nsomewhere in the back of their minds, and that they would find something\nsteady and true in its simple beauty. This was the faith I had in literature: its\ntruth was constant, unaffected by the struggles of daily life. But at the same\ntime there was always the issue of relevance, and there were moments when a\npoem like “Nothing Gold Can Stay” seemed useless against the harsh\nrealities of a place like Fuling.\nI thought about that for a while, and then I went back to grading the\nexaminations. I didn’t have any answers; in the end I just had to hope for the\nbest. Most of them would be fine, I figured.

The city was booming, its\ngrowth spurred by resettlements from low-lying towns that eventually would\nbe flooded by the Three Gorges Dam. The Huang family, who owned the\nsimple noodle restaurant where I used to eat, had opened an Internet café. My\nstudents had scattered to all corners of the country: to Tibet, to Shanghai, to\nShenzhen, to Wenzhou. But none of this appeared in River Town—the book\nof eternal standstill.\nAfter moving back to China in the spring of 1999, I returned to Fuling at\nleast once a year. The trips were easier than in the old days, because of the\nhighway, and my new life as a writer in Beijing allowed me the freedom to\ntravel. Often, I visited Fuling and then headed downstream along the\nYangtze, into the heart of the Three Gorges.\nDuring my Peace Corps years, the dam had always seemed like an\nabstraction—a vague promise, a distant threat. But every time I returned it\nbecame a little more tangible. By 2002, the resettlements were well\nunderway, and the landscape had become sharply divided between the past\nand the future. Down near the banks, the old river towns and villages were\nleft virtually unimproved. Even though the rest of China was in a\nconstruction frenzy, it was pointless to build anything where the water was\ncertain to rise. These low-lying settlements were allowed to deteriorate, until\neverything looked neglected: broken bricks, dirty tiles, murky streets. The\ndoomed towns contrasted with the new cities, which were being constructed\nof cement and white tile, perched high on the hills above the river. Whenever\nI floated down the Yangtze, I could read the landscape’s evolving history at a\nglance, in a series of horizontal bands: the dark riverside settlements that\nbelonged to the past, the green stretch of farmland that would be claimed by\nthe reservoir, and then, high above, the clusters of white looking toward the\nfuture.\nMy final pre-dam journey was in the fall of 2002. Equipped with a tent\nand sleeping bags, a friend and I set out to hike the old paths that had been\ncarved into the riverside cliffs nearly a century ago. The weather was perfect,\nand the trails were breathtaking; sometimes, they led us high above the\nYangtze, with a hundred-foot drop straight to the water below. With every\nmile I thought: this is the last time I’ll see this trail.\nWe traveled upstream, and we took our time. After spending a week",

The city was booming, its\ngrowth spurred by resettlements from low-lying towns that eventually would\nbe flooded by the Three Gorges Dam. The Huang family, who owned the\nsimple noodle restaurant where I used to eat, had opened an Internet café. My\nstudents had scattered to all corners of the country: to Tibet, to Shanghai, to\nShenzhen, to Wenzhou. But none of this appeared in River Town—the book\nof eternal standstill.\nAfter moving back to China in the spring of 1999, I returned to Fuling at\nleast once a year. The trips were easier than in the old days, because of the\nhighway, and my new life as a writer in Beijing allowed me the freedom to\ntravel. Often, I visited Fuling and then headed downstream along the\nYangtze, into the heart of the Three Gorges.\nDuring my Peace Corps years, the dam had always seemed like an\nabstraction—a vague promise, a distant threat. But every time I returned it\nbecame a little more tangible. By 2002, the resettlements were well\nunderway, and the landscape had become sharply divided between the past\nand the future. Down near the banks, the old river towns and villages were\nleft virtually unimproved. Even though the rest of China was in a\nconstruction frenzy, it was pointless to build anything where the water was\ncertain to rise. These low-lying settlements were allowed to deteriorate, until\neverything looked neglected: broken bricks, dirty tiles, murky streets. The\ndoomed towns contrasted with the new cities, which were being constructed\nof cement and white tile, perched high on the hills above the river. Whenever\nI floated down the Yangtze, I could read the landscape’s evolving history at a\nglance, in a series of horizontal bands: the dark riverside settlements that\nbelonged to the past, the green stretch of farmland that would be claimed by\nthe reservoir, and then, high above, the clusters of white looking toward the\nfuture.\nMy final pre-dam journey was in the fall of 2002. Equipped with a tent\nand sleeping bags, a friend and I set out to hike the old paths that had been\ncarved into the riverside cliffs nearly a century ago. The weather was perfect,\nand the trails were breathtaking; sometimes, they led us high above the\nYangtze, with a hundred-foot drop straight to the water below. With every\nmile I thought: this is the last time I’ll see this trail.\nWe traveled upstream, and we took our time. After spending a week"

        "anybody said something. But he had always been one of my favorites, and\nnow I was touched by his request.\n“Especially I want you to read ‘The Raven,’” he said, “and anything by\nShakespeare. This is so I can remember your literature class.”\nI told him that I would make the tape that evening.\n“Also, after you finish the poems,” he said, grinning, “I want you to say\nall of the bad words you know in English and put them on the tape. Even if\nthere are some bad words you did not teach us, I want you to say them. I\nwould like that very much. And maybe some of the other students will copy\nit, too.”\nIt took two long sittings to record all the poetry we had studied. After that\nwas finished. Adam and I spent five minutes shouting obscenities into the\nrecorder, and I returned the tape to Jimmy. He would turn out fine, too. Most\nof them were that way. They were tough and sweet and funny and sad, and\npeople like that would always survive. It wasn’t necessarily gold, but perhaps\nbecause of that it would stay.\nI LEFT FULING on the fast boat upstream to Chongqing. It was a warm,\nrainy morning at the end of June—the mist thick on the Yangtze like dirty\ngray silk. A car from the college drove Adam and me down to the docks. The\ncity rushed past, gray and familiar in the rain.\nThe evening before, we had eaten for the last time at the Students’ Home.\nThey kept the restaurant open late especially for us, because all night we were\nrushing around saying goodbye to everybody, and it was good to finally sit\nthere and eat our noodles. We kidded the women about the new foreign\ndevils who would come next fall to take our place, and how easily they could\nbe cheated.\nA few days earlier, Huang Neng, the grandfather, had talked with me\nabout leaving.\n“You know,” he said, “when you go back to your America, it won’t be\nlike it is here. You won’t be able to walk into a restaurant and say, ‘I want a\nbowl of chaoshou.’ Nobody will understand you!”\n“That’s true,” I said. “And we don’t have chaoshou in America.”\n“You’ll have to order food in your English language,” he said. “You",
        "won’t be able to speak our Chinese with the people there.” And he laughed—\nit was a ludicrous concept, a country with neither Chinese nor chaoshou.\nAfter our last meal the family lined up at the door and waved goodbye,\nstanding stiffly and wearing that tight Chinese smile. I imagined that\nprobably I looked the same way—two years of friendship somehow tucked\naway in a corner of my mouth.\nIn the morning we said goodbye to Sunni and Noreen, both of whom had\nearly class, and then we headed down to the docks. A few of the students\nwere free that morning and they came to see us off, along with Dean Fu.\nChinese partings were never comfortable—no hugs, few words, tears held\nback as long as possible. We shook hands awkwardly and boarded the boat.\nThe hydrofoil was crowded. They played karaoke videos on the television\nscreen while we sat there at the dock for thirty minutes. Outside it was\nraining, but still the students waited. To show respect for a good friend you\nwould see him off until he was completely and undeniably gone, regardless\nof the weather.\nMost of them were crying as they stared out at the river. Mo Money\ncrouched on a black pylon near the edge of the dock. William Jefferson\nFoster looked out toward White Flat Mountain, and Roger squatted near a\ncoil of rope. Luke leaned against a wall. There were others—Chuck, Diaz,\nLewis, Richard, DJ. Their eyes were red, and they did the best they could to\nhold their expressions even.\nI watched them standing in the rain and wondered what their futures\nwould be like. William Jefferson Foster was going off to teach at a private\nschool in the eastern province of Zhejiang; Mo Money was looking for\nbusiness jobs in Fuling; Lewis would return to the remote countryside and\nteach. Luke would be married in October, on National Day. It was an\narranged marriage and he had never spent much time with his future wife, but\nhe was a good peasant son who would not oppose his parents’ wishes.\nThe boat pulled out of the harbor. The students stood perfectly still on the\ndock. Behind them the city rose, gray and dirty-looking in the mist. As\nalways on the river I saw Fuling with an outsider’s eyes: it looked big,\nimpersonal, impenetrable. It was hard to believe that for two years this place\nhad been my home. I wondered when I would see it again, and how it would\nbe changed. The boat swung out into the heart of the Yangtze, facing the\ncurrent.",
        "The river was the same as it always had been. It wasn’t like the people,\nwho had changed so much in my eyes over the course of the two years, and\nwho would now go their own separate and unpredictable ways even as they\nwere frozen in my mind, pinned by memory—making chaoshou, teaching\nclass, standing motionless on the docks. But it was different out on the river,\nwhere my guanxi with the Yangtze had always been simple: sometimes I\nwent with the current, and sometimes I went against it. Upstream it was\nslower and downstream it was faster. That was really all there was to it—we\ncrossed paths, and then we headed off in our own directions.\nAnd finally I stopped worrying about the future or the past, and I simply\nlooked at the city for the last time. The buildings were gray. The mouth of the\nWu was wide with the summer rain. A sampan sculled gracefully near the\nshore. Raise the Flag Mountain was hidden in the mist. Our boat picked up\nspeed and we rushed away against the steady current of the river.",

        "About the author\nMeet Peter Hessler\nI GREW UP IN COLUMBIA, MISSOURI, where my father was a professor\nof sociology at the University of Missouri. My mother teaches history at\nColumbia College. I have three sisters, and all of us attended the local public\nschool, Hickman High School, where I first became interested in literature\nand writing. My sophomore year English teacher, Mary Racine, encouraged\nme to consider a career in writing. Over the next two years, I studied under\ntwo other excellent English teachers, Mary Ann Gates and Khaki Westerfield.\nBy the time I graduated in 1988, I knew that I wanted to become a writer.\n“ I took John McPhee’s seminar in nonfiction writing as a junior,\nwhich helped me realize the possibilities of narrative nonfiction.”\nAt Princeton University I majored in English and Creative Writing. As an\nundergraduate, I focused primarily on writing fiction. I studied under Russell\nBanks, Stuart Dybek, and Joyce Carol Oates. My senior thesis was a\ncollection of short stories set in Missouri.\nAs a junior, I took John McPhee’s seminar in nonfiction writing, which\nhelped me realize the possibilities of narrative nonfiction. The following\nsummer I worked as an ethnographer for the Kellogg Foundation, writing a\nlong ethnographic study about Sikeston, a small town in the southeastern\nMissouri boot heel. The paper was published in Journal for Applied\nAnthropology, and the experience was a valuable introduction to research and\nwriting in a small town.\nI wanted to go overseas after graduation, and as a senior I decided on two\noptions: I applied to join the Peace Corps, and I applied for fellowships to",
        "study in England. The Peace Corps planned to send me to Africa, but I pulled\nmy application after receiving a scholarship to Oxford. For two years, I\nstudied English language and literature. After graduating in the summer of\n1994, I went home the wrong way—via the East. For six months I traveled\nfrom Prague to the Gulf of Thailand, all by train and bus and boat. During the\ntrip, I took the Trans-Siberian train to China—my first time in the country.\nThat journey also introduced me to travel writing, and I published stories\nabout my experiences in various American newspapers, including the New\nYork Times and the Philadelphia Inquirer.\nIn 1995, I received a Friends of Switzerland grant, which funded two\nmonths of hiking and writing in the Alps. For most of a year I worked as a\nfreelance writer, publishing travel essays and features. In 1995, I applied\nonce again to the Peace Corps—but this time I requested Asia as my\ndestination. I was thrilled when the Peace Corps sent me back to China.\nWhile teaching in Fuling, I studied Chinese and freelanced the occasional\nstory for American newspapers (including the New York Times and the Los\nAngeles Times). In August of 1998 I returned to Columbia, Missouri, where I\nspent the rest of the year writing about my experiences in Fuling. After\ncompleting a draft of River Town, I tried unsuccessfully to find a job with a\nmajor American newspaper or magazine. Finally, in March of 1999, I\ndecided to return to China independently and try to establish myself as a\nfreelance writer. I settled in Beijing, where I worked part-time for the Wall\nStreet Journal as an assistant (or “clipper”). Most of my time was spent\nfreelancing for a wide range of newspapers and magazines. In 2000, I began\nwriting for National Geographic and The New Yorker. In 2001, I became the\nfirst resident correspondent for The New Yorker to be accredited by the\nPeople’s Republic of China. But I have always remained an independent\nfreelance writer—teaching in the Peace Corps is still the only “real job” that\nI’ve ever had.\n“In March of 1999, I decided to return to China independently and\ntry to establish myself as a freelance writer.”\nI never studied journalism, and some of the less formal aspects of my",
        "education have been the most productive. I learned more in the Peace Corps\nthan I learned at Oxford, and my summer job as an ethnographer was one of\nthe most valuable writing experiences I had during university. Nowadays, I\ntry to approach narrative nonfiction with the lessons of both literature and the\nsocial sciences. I’m particularly interested in what sociologists call a\n“longitudinal study”—following a subject through time. In China, I’ve often\nkept in touch with individuals over a period of several years, recording how\nthey respond to a fast-changing society.\nSince 1999, I have lived in Beijing, where I have an apartment in a\nhutong. I also keep a home outside of the city in a small village called\nSancha, where I can see the Great Wall from my desk.",
        "About the book\nReturn to Fuling\nI WROTE THE FIRST DRAFT of River Town in four months. There wasn’t\nany reason to work so fast; I had no contract or deadline. I could have taken\nmy time, enjoying life in the States after a long absence, but every day I\nstarted writing early and finished late. Memories pushed me to work faster,\nbecause I was afraid that I would lose the immediacy of my time in Fuling.\nAnd I was also motivated by the future: I wanted to record my impressions of\na city that was on the verge of massive change.\n“Memories pushed me to work faster, because I was afraid that I\nwould lose the immediacy of my time in Fuling.”\nThat sense of transformation—constant, relentless, overwhelming change\n—has been the defining characteristic of China during the past two decades.\nIt’s hard to believe that the country used to appear exactly the opposite: the\nChinese were “the people of eternal standstill,” according to Leopold von\nRanke, the nineteenth-century German historian. Nowadays, no description\ncould be less accurate, and one challenge for the writer is that the pen simply\ncan’t keep pace. On the first page of River Town, I wrote\nThere was no railroad in Fuling. It had always been a poor part of\nSichuan province and the roads were bad. To go anywhere, you took the\nboat, but mostly you didn’t go anywhere.\nBy the time the book was published in 2001, a superhighway had been",
        "completed to Chongqing, and almost no one took the Yangtze boats to Fuling\nanymore. A railroad line was under construction. The city was booming, its\ngrowth spurred by resettlements from low-lying towns that eventually would\nbe flooded by the Three Gorges Dam. The Huang family, who owned the\nsimple noodle restaurant where I used to eat, had opened an Internet café. My\nstudents had scattered to all corners of the country: to Tibet, to Shanghai, to\nShenzhen, to Wenzhou. But none of this appeared in River Town—the book\nof eternal standstill.\nAfter moving back to China in the spring of 1999, I returned to Fuling at\nleast once a year. The trips were easier than in the old days, because of the\nhighway, and my new life as a writer in Beijing allowed me the freedom to\ntravel. Often, I visited Fuling and then headed downstream along the\nYangtze, into the heart of the Three Gorges.\nDuring my Peace Corps years, the dam had always seemed like an\nabstraction—a vague promise, a distant threat. But every time I returned it\nbecame a little more tangible. By 2002, the resettlements were well\nunderway, and the landscape had become sharply divided between the past\nand the future. Down near the banks, the old river towns and villages were\nleft virtually unimproved. Even though the rest of China was in a\nconstruction frenzy, it was pointless to build anything where the water was\ncertain to rise. These low-lying settlements were allowed to deteriorate, until\neverything looked neglected: broken bricks, dirty tiles, murky streets. The\ndoomed towns contrasted with the new cities, which were being constructed\nof cement and white tile, perched high on the hills above the river. Whenever\nI floated down the Yangtze, I could read the landscape’s evolving history at a\nglance, in a series of horizontal bands: the dark riverside settlements that\nbelonged to the past, the green stretch of farmland that would be claimed by\nthe reservoir, and then, high above, the clusters of white looking toward the\nfuture.\nMy final pre-dam journey was in the fall of 2002. Equipped with a tent\nand sleeping bags, a friend and I set out to hike the old paths that had been\ncarved into the riverside cliffs nearly a century ago. The weather was perfect,\nand the trails were breathtaking; sometimes, they led us high above the\nYangtze, with a hundred-foot drop straight to the water below. With every\nmile I thought: this is the last time I’ll see this trail.\nWe traveled upstream, and we took our time. After spending a week",
        "along the paths, we visited the riverside settlements that were being\ndemolished. The old city of Wushan had just been torn down, and I wandered\nthrough the rubble, where scavengers gathered anything that could be sold—\nbricks and wire, glass and wood, nails and window frames. One group of men\nwere huddled around a campfire, surrounded by the broken walls of a big\nbuilding, and then I recognized a half-destroyed sign. They were camped in\nthe lobby of the Red Flag Hotel, where I had stayed during my first trip\ndownstream in 1997.\nAll of my favorite river towns were in various stages of destruction.\nDachang was a quarter gone; Peishi was a memory; Daxi was finished.\nSometimes I passed through a village after the scavengers had done their\nwork, and in the silence I studied the things that had been left behind. In\nDaxi, I found a framed photograph of Mount Fuji with a rush of cherry\nblossoms in the foreground. In Qingshi, I hiked past an overstuffed red chair,\nan old basketball rim, and a broken stone tablet whose inscription dated to the\nbeginning of the last century. One house—stripped of roof and windows—\nstill had the front door bolted shut. In Peishi, I purchased mineral water from\na couple whose temporary shack was constructed entirely of scavenged doors\nand window frames. It could have been a Taoist riddle: What does it mean to\nlive in a room made of doors?\nBy the time I reached Fuling the old part of town had been mostly\ndemolished. New developments crowded high on the hilltops, and the city’s\nmassive dike was almost finished. Across the Wu River, the teachers college\nwas also expanding and changing. Old cadres had retired; the new guard was\nmore open to foreigners. Albert, the friendly young man who had first\ngreeted Adam and me upon our arrival, was now the dean of the English\ndepartment. When I visited his office he pulled out the hardback copy of\nRiver Town that I had given the college a year earlier.\n“You can see that a lot of people have read it,” he said. The cover jacket\nwas torn and tea-stained; the corners had been flattened. Fingers had marked\nthe pages a dirty gray. It felt heavy in my hands—an artifact. How could I\nhave written anything that looked so old?\nIn a way, the pace of change seemed to help locals feel comfortable with\nthe book, whose world already seemed faraway. My tutor, Teacher Kong, had\nread it over the course of a summer—word by word, using a dictionary\nbecause he spoke little English. He told me that he had laughed at many",
        "sections that brought back fond memories. During my visit, when I was\nhosted at a local restaurant by college officials, they teased me about my\ndescriptions of past banquets. “We don’t want to make you drink too much!”\none cadre said. “You wrote in your book that we forced you to drink too\nmuch.”\n“It wasn’t a big problem,” I said.\n“We certainly wouldn’t want to do that again!” another cadre said.\nSomebody else chimed in: “Do you want some more baijiu?”\nDuring the days I wandered through the city, looking up old friends. At\nthe bank, I stopped to see Qian Manli, the pretty young woman with whom I\nhad had my only “date” during two years in Fuling. That had been a short\ninterlude: after an hour I discovered that she was married. Now she had a\ntwo-year-old child. She said the same thing that she always said when I\nreturned to Fuling.\n“You don’t recognize me, do you?” she asked. “I’m a lot fatter than\nbefore.”\nI said, “You look exactly the same.”\n“Tell me the truth,” she demanded. “I’m fatter, aren’t I?”\nWhat should an author do when a character gains weight? “You look\ngreat,” I said, and I left it at that.\nWhen the first stage of the dam was completed, and the gates were finally\nclosed, I returned to Wushan. It was June of 2003. In The New Yorker, I\npublished a description of one family’s response to the rising river. They had\nwaited as long as possible, harvesting their vegetables just before the water\narrived:\nJune 7, 2003\nAt six thirteen in the evening, after the Zhou family has already\nmoved their television, a desk, two tables, and five chairs onto a\npumpkin patch beside the road, I prop a brick upright at the river’s\nedge. On new maps for the city of Wushan, this body of water is called\nEmerald Drop Lake. But the maps were printed before the lake\nappeared. In fact, the water is a murky brown, and the lake is actually",
        "an inlet of the Yangtze River, which for the past week has been rising\nbehind the Three Gorges Dam. On Zhou Ji’en’s next trip down from his\nfamily’s bamboo-frame shack, he carries a wooden cupboard on his\nback. A small man, he has a pretty wife and two young daughters, and\nuntil recently they were residents of Longmen Village. The village does\nnot appear on the new maps. A friend of Zhou’s carries the next load,\nwhich includes the family’s battery-powered clock. The clock, like my\nwristwatch, reads nearly six thirty-five. The water has climbed two\ninches up the brick.\nWatching the river rise is like tracking the progress of the clock’s\nshort hand: it’s all but imperceptible. There is no visible current, no\nsound of rushing water—but at the end of every hour another half foot\nhas been gained. The movement seems to come from within, and to some\ndegree it is mysterious to every living thing on the shrinking banks.\nBeetles, ants, and centipedes radiate out in swarms from the river’s\nedge. After the water has surrounded the brick, a cluster of insects crawl\nmadly onto the dry tip, trying desperately to escape as their tiny island\nis consumed.\nFor more than a week, the water rose at the rate of six inches an hour.\nThe details drew me in, until my focus was sharp and the lens narrow: the\nminutes, the seconds, the brick, the insects. When it was all over, and I\nboarded the boat to leave Wushan, the river had become a lake.\nI have not returned since. That wasn’t how I planned it, and I’m not sure why\nI’ve delayed. Perhaps it’s because I wanted to finish my second book, and I\nfeared that a journey to familiar ground would be distracting. Or maybe\nthere’s something about the dam’s finality that saddens me.\nBut I recognize the risks of foreign nostalgia, especially in a place once\nknown as home to “the people of eternal standstill.” If it’s sad to watch a\nlandscape be transformed beyond recognition, it’s even sadder to spend time\nin a place that doesn’t change. One of my former students, William Jefferson\nFoster, left his remote hometown after graduation. Like more than one",
        "hundred million rural Chinese across the nation, he became a migrant. He\ntraveled to the boomtowns of the eastern coast, where he found success as an\nEnglish teacher in a private school. One year, after visiting his parents during\na vacation, he wrote me a letter about his hometown. Nearly everybody of\nWilly’s generation had left, and the village seemed to be dying:\nWhen I am home, nothing has changed and the roads are still rough\nand people are getting older. It makes me sad that I can not find familiar\npeople or friends who I knew well when I was young.\nFor most Chinese, that’s the alternative to constant change: poverty and\nbad roads and slow boats. As a foreigner who learned to love Fuling during\nthe period from 1996 to 1998, I’m grateful that I had the opportunity to\nrecord those years, and I miss the places I knew. But I’m also grateful that\nmost people in the city are optimistic about the future. I’ll be back soon, and I\nlook forward to the journey. It will feel good to be on the Yangtze again,\neven if the swift current of the old river is nothing but a memory.\nBeijing, October 2005",

It reflects the period in the 1980s when reforms first started to take\nhold and Chinese like Gao began to travel and gain a new sense of their\ncountry.\nRED DUST by Ma Jian\nLike Gao’s book, Red Dust describes the travels of an artistic young man\nduring the 1980s. But Ma Jian’s book is nonfiction and he gives a fascinating\nglimpse of society during that period—for example, the cross-country\ncontacts of the intelligentsia, who protected and supported each other. Many\nparts of the book are also quite funny.\nYANGTZE: NATURE, HISTORY, AND THE RIVER by\nLyman P. Van Slyke\nIn my opinion this is the best history book about the Yangtze. It’s not\nweighed down by a need to be relentlessly comprehensive or authoritative;\nYangtze feels like the work of a historian who simply loves the texture of the\nriver’s past.",
        "A SINGLE PEBBLE by John Hersey\nIn Hersey’s novel, the Yangtze world is romanticized and dramatized—his\ntrackers’ paths, for example, are a lot more treacherous than the actual\ncliffside routes that were used by many travelers. But the book is well written\nand gives a powerful sense of the early dream of the Yangtze dam. In A\nSingle Pebble, the foreigners are the ones pushing the idea; by the time the\ndam was actually built, foreigners had become its loudest critics.\nWAR TRASH by Ha Jin\nThis novel describes a Chinese soldier’s experience in the Korean War (in\nChinese it’s known as “the War to Resist America and Aid Korea”). This\nperspective is rare in both the United States and in China, where histories\ngloss over the ways in which this conflict damaged so many Chinese lives.\n1587: A YEAR OF NO SIGNIFICANCE by Ray Huang\nThis history book’s subtitle is “The Ming Dynasty in Decline,” and it\ndescribes in wonderful detail a ruler who is losing his grip on the empire.\nSome aspects of this book—the weight of bureaucracy, for example—are still\nrecognizable to anybody who lives in China. Chinese histories can be so\noverwhelming, and I find this book valuable because its narrow focus\nactually allows for a broader scope: a powerful sense of time, authority, and\nempire.\nGOD’S CHINESE SON: THE TAIPING HEAVENLY\nKINGDOM OF HONG XIUQUAN by Jonathan D. Spence\nI like many of Spence’s books and this is probably my favorite. It describes a\nbizarre moment in Chinese history, when an obscure aspirant to the civil\nservice suffered a breakdown and, in a series of visions, came to believe that\nhe was Jesus’s Chinese brother. He gained thousands of followers, as well as\nmilitary control over much of China’s southeast before the rebellion was\nfinally put down. The story shows how foreign ideas sometimes retain their\npower but become warped when they move between cultures.\nSIX RECORDS OF A FLOATING LIFE by Shen Fu",
        "This is a small, quiet book—the reflections of an obscure government clerk\nwho was born at the end of the eighteenth century. Unlike most records from\nthat period (or any period in Chinese history, for that matter), this book is\nintensely personal. Shen Fu describes his love for his wife as well as his\nrelations with various courtesans. It’s a rare book, and it makes the reader\nrealize how many details of everyday life weren’t recorded or preserved in a\nculture whose literary tradition tended to be quite formal.\nRED AZALEA by Anchee Min\nThere’s something mesmerizing about this book, which covers a devastating\nperiod in short sentences, one after another, until the Cultural Revolution is\nbroken down into a train of impressions and emotions and visions of\nbrutality. That’s how an anti-individual political campaign appears to\nsomebody who is fiercely individual.\nWILD GRASS by Ian Johnson\nThis is an excellent book for anybody who is writing about contemporary\nChina. Johnson gives a sense of his working methods without dominating the\nstory, and his portraits of individual Chinese are moving. In particular his\nsection on Falun Gong is an example of narrative nonfiction at its best.\nCOMING HOME CRAZY by Bill Holm;\nIRON AND SILK by Mark Salzman\nThese are extremely different books, and people who live in China tend to\nhave strong reactions to them, both positive and negative. I list them together\nbecause they are both about teaching English in China, and also because they\nweighed on me when I wrote River Town. I knew that I wanted to write\nsomething different. But back when I lived in Fuling, and the pressures of\nwriting were the last thing on my mind, I thoroughly enjoyed both of these\nbooks. They reminded me that the experience of teaching in China had been\nshared by many, but also that each teacher had his own story.",
        "Read an Excerpt from Peter Hessler’s Oracle Bones\nOracle Bones tells the story of modern-day China and its growing links to the\nWestern world, as seen through the lives of a handful of ordinary people who\nare connected in one way or another to America. In addition to the author,\nhimself an American living as a journalist in Beijing, the narrative tracks\nPolat, a trader and member of a forgotten ethnic minority, who moves to\nWashington, D.C.; William Jefferson Foster, who grew up in a remote village\nwhere most residents were illiterate; Emily, a migrant factory worker in a\ncity without a past; and Chen Mengjia, a scholar of mysterious ancient\nartifacts known as oracle bones, and a man whose story has slipped into\nobscurity since his suicide in the 1960s. All of them are migrants, emigrants,\nor wanderers who find themselves far from home, their lives dramatically\nchanged by historical forces they are struggling to understand. Oracle Bones\nis now available in hardcover from HarperCollins Publishers.",
        "ASYLUM\nJanuary 2001\nWASHINGTON, D.C., like Beijing, is a deliberate capital. Both cities are\nsquare: straight streets, right angles. They are arranged strictly according to\nthe compass, and each occupies a site that represented, in the eyes of a\nvisionary ruler, a blank slate. The Ming emperor Yongle selected his location\non the northern plain; George Washington chose the bend of the Potomac\nRiver. And each city’s layout—the grid of monuments and broad streets—\nimmediately tells a visitor that this is a seat of authority.\nAt the heart of each capital stands a political structure. In Beijing, the\nForbidden City represents the center; in Washington, D.C., everything\nemanates from the domed building of the United States Capitol. From that\npoint, the street names follow a strict logic, a testimony to American\npragmatism: roads that run north and south are numbered; letters of the\nalphabet mark the east-west streets. Heading due north from the domed\nbuilding, along North Capitol Street, one crosses the latter part of the\nalphabet—Q Street, R Street, S Street—before the intersection of Rhode\nIsland Avenue. Rhode Island continues northeast (U, V, W) and then, after\nthe first alphabet is exhausted, it begins anew with two-syllable names:\nAdams, Bryant, Channing. Douglas for D, Evarts for E, Franklin for F. On\nthe corner of Franklin and Rhode Island is a dilapidated beige-brick\napartment building. Inside that building, in an apartment on the third floor,\nfive Uighurs found a temporary home in the fall of 2000.\nFor months, the apartment had served as a way station for recent arrivals\nfrom China. The rent was only four hundred dollars a month, and tenancy\nwas passed from Uighur to Uighur. The apartment consisted of a small\nkitchen, two bedrooms, and a living room where a pair of mattresses had\nbeen laid out on the floor. One wall of the living room was decorated with\nframed verses from the Koran; across the room, on another wall, hung a\nmulticolored map of the United States.\nNone of the current residents planned to stay in the apartment for long.\nOne man had recently crossed illegally from Canada; another had already\nreceived political asylum and was applying for permanent resident status; the",
        "others were preparing asylum applications. Each man found his own path\nthrough the city, acquiring jobs, lawyers, necessary documents. Along the\nway, they explored holes in the system. That was another link between\nWashington, D.C., and Beijing: beneath the grid of straight streets and\nimpressive monuments, there was always an element of disorder.\nShortly after Polat moved into the apartment, he read the classified\nsection of a Chinese-language newspaper and noticed an advertisement for\n“driver’s license consulting.” The service was based in the District’s\nChinatown, and for $150, the consultants offered to provide the paperwork\nfor a Virginia driver’s license. Among the immigrant community, Virginia\nwas known for its loophole: applicants for driver’s licenses and state identity\ncards didn’t have to show proof of residence or even identity. The only\nrequirement was a notarized affidavit testifying that the applicant lived in\nVirginia and had valid documents. It was possible for an out-of-state, illegal\nimmigrant—in other words, somebody like Polat—to acquire a Virginia\ndriver’s license without ever showing his passport to a government official.\nNon-English speakers were also allowed to bring their own translators to the\nexamination.\nThe Chinatown service arranged Polat’s affidavit, no questions asked,\nand they sent a Chinese man to accompany him during the written exam.\nWhenever the Chinese man came to the correct answer of a multiple-choice\nquestion, he muttered, Da ge, which means “big brother.” Big brother, big\nbrother, big brother. Polat passed with flying colors. After receiving his\nlicense, he bought a silver 1992 Honda Accord for thirty-one hundred dollars.\nOne evening that winter, Polat tried to call his mother in Xinjiang, but the\napartment’s phone service was cut off. He decided to use the public telephone\nnear the corner of Rhode Island and Franklin. It was almost midnight. The\npay phone was right across the street from the Good Ole Reliable Liquor\nStore.\nWhile he was punching the numbers, a man came up from behind and\nsaid something that Polat didn’t understand. He ignored the man and kept\ndialing Xinjiang. Before Polat could finish, he felt something pressed against\nhis back. He whirled around and saw that the object was a handgun.\nTwo men: one with the gun, one in a car. “Lay down,” said the gunman,\nand this time Polat understood. He dropped down; the gunman searched him.\nHe found seventy dollars in a front pocket but somehow missed the three",
        "hundred that Polat had stashed in another pocket. The two muggers drove\naway on Rhode Island Avenue. Polat picked himself up and hurried back to\nthe apartment. He had been outside for less than five minutes.\nTHAT WINTER, I visited the United States for a month. I spent Christmas\nwith my parents and sisters in Missouri, and I saw friends and editors in\nvarious cities: Los Angeles, San Francisco, New York, and Washington, D.C.\nNone of these places felt truly familiar. I had grown up in one American\nsmall town and attended college in another; since graduation I had lived\noverseas. There wasn’t a single big city in America that I could negotiate\nwithout a map.\nTo me, the capital felt the most foreign. The layout was intimidating;\nthere never seemed to be enough people to fill the District. In January, the\nmonuments looked particularly deserted: empty paths, yellowed grass. The\nsky was the color of cold metal; the forecast called for snow. I took the metro\nto Rhode Island Avenue, surrounded by unfamiliar faces. The first person I\nrecognized was a Uighur.\nHe had waited outside the station, on foot—his Honda was in the shop.\nWe grinned and shook hands, just like the old days in Yabaolu. His face\nlooked thinner; he had lost weight since coming to America. He still chain-\nsmoked, but now he bought Marlboro Lights instead of Hilton. Back in\nBeijing, he had preferred Marlboro but usually didn’t buy them, because of\nall the fakes.\nWe walked to his apartment, and he laughed when I took off my coat.\n“Your shirt’s the same as mine,” he said.\nI looked down and realized that we had dressed identically: olive green\nCaterpillar-brand denim shirts.\n“Did you buy that in Yabaolu?” he asked.\n“Yes. In that new market in Chaoyangmenwai.”\n“It’s jiade,” he said, laughing. “Fake. Same as mine. How much did you\npay?”\nThat was a question that had no good answer in China; the moment\nanybody asked, you knew you had gotten ripped off.\n“Maybe seventy yuan,” I said, hopelessly.",

        "ACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nTHIS BOOK WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN POSSIBLE without my\nfamily. I owe a great deal to all the Hesslers and Gundys who kept in touch\nduring my two years in Sichuan, and thanks for your encouragement and\nsupport while I was writing. I promise that someday I’ll find subjects closer\nto home.\nFrom the first trip downriver to the final revision of the manuscript,\nAdam Meier has been everything I could ask of a friend. In particular, thanks\nfor being such a steadying influence in Fuling, and thanks for all your help\nwith the editing—at times, a difficult and delicate process. We’ve tilted at our\nshare of windmills together and not for a moment would I have rather been\nthere with anybody else.\nI was also fortunate to share the joys and challenges of Fuling life with\nSunni Fass and Noreen Finnegan, who were great sitemates. I couldn’t have\nstarted my time in Sichuan with a better group than Peace Corps China 3:\nTamy Chapman, Sean Coady, Mike Goettig, Rose Karkoski, Karen Lauck,\nLisa McCallum, Rob Schmitz, Craig Simons, Sarah Telford, Rebecca Steinle\nWallihan, Andrew and Molly Watkins, and Adam Weiss. I also want to thank\nTravis Klingberg, Christopher Marquardt, Mike Meyer, and the Wolken\nfamily for their friendship, both in Sichuan and afterwards.\nThe Peace Corps China staff provided me with a perfect combination of\nsupport and freedom while I was in Fuling, especially Dr. William Speidel,\nKandice Christian, Don McKay, and Zhan Yimei.\nA number of editors helped me with revisions. In particular, I was\nfortunate to work with Doug Hunt of the University of Missouri, who was\nalways generous with his time and good advice. I appreciated the comments\nand recommendations of Scott Kramer, Matt Metzger, Angela Hessler,\nTerzah Ewing of the Wall Street Journal, and Ian Johnson of the Wall Street",

      "text": "anybody said something. But he had always been one of my favorites, and\nnow I was touched by his request.\n“Especially I want you to read ‘The Raven,’” he said, “and anything by\nShakespeare. This is so I can remember your literature class.”\nI told him that I would make the tape that evening.\n“Also, after you finish the poems,” he said, grinning, “I want you to say\nall of the bad words you know in English and put them on the tape. Even if\nthere are some bad words you did not teach us, I want you to say them. I\nwould like that very much. And maybe some of the other students will copy\nit, too.”\nIt took two long sittings to record all the poetry we had studied. After that\nwas finished. Adam and I spent five minutes shouting obscenities into the\nrecorder, and I returned the tape to Jimmy. He would turn out fine, too. Most\nof them were that way. They were tough and sweet and funny and sad, and\npeople like that would always survive. It wasn’t necessarily gold, but perhaps\nbecause of that it would stay.\nI LEFT FULING on the fast boat upstream to Chongqing. It was a warm,\nrainy morning at the end of June—the mist thick on the Yangtze like dirty\ngray silk. A car from the college drove Adam and me down to the docks. The\ncity rushed past, gray and familiar in the rain.\nThe evening before, we had eaten for the last time at the Students’ Home.\nThey kept the restaurant open late especially for us, because all night we were\nrushing around saying goodbye to everybody, and it was good to finally sit\nthere and eat our noodles. We kidded the women about the new foreign\ndevils who would come next fall to take our place, and how easily they could\nbe cheated.\nA few days earlier, Huang Neng, the grandfather, had talked with me\nabout leaving.\n“You know,” he said, “when you go back to your America, it won’t be\nlike it is here. You won’t be able to walk into a restaurant and say, ‘I want a\nbowl of chaoshou.’ Nobody will understand you!”\n“That’s true,” I said. “And we don’t have chaoshou in America.”\n“You’ll have to order food in your English language,” he said. “You\n\nwon’t be able to speak our Chinese with the people there.” And he laughed—\nit was a ludicrous concept, a country with neither Chinese nor chaoshou.\nAfter our last meal the family lined up at the door and waved goodbye,\nstanding stiffly and wearing that tight Chinese smile. I imagined that\nprobably I looked the same way—two years of friendship somehow tucked\naway in a corner of my mouth.\nIn the morning we said goodbye to Sunni and Noreen, both of whom had\nearly class, and then we headed down to the docks. A few of the students\nwere free that morning and they came to see us off, along with Dean Fu.\nChinese partings were never comfortable—no hugs, few words, tears held\nback as long as possible. We shook hands awkwardly and boarded the boat.\nThe hydrofoil was crowded. They played karaoke videos on the television\nscreen while we sat there at the dock for thirty minutes. Outside it was\nraining, but still the students waited. To show respect for a good friend you\nwould see him off until he was completely and undeniably gone, regardless\nof the weather.\nMost of them were crying as they stared out at the river. Mo Money\ncrouched on a black pylon near the edge of the dock. William Jefferson\nFoster looked out toward White Flat Mountain, and Roger squatted near a\ncoil of rope. Luke leaned against a wall. There were others—Chuck, Diaz,\nLewis, Richard, DJ. Their eyes were red, and they did the best they could to\nhold their expressions even.\nI watched them standing in the rain and wondered what their futures\nwould be like. William Jefferson Foster was going off to teach at a private\nschool in the eastern province of Zhejiang; Mo Money was looking for\nbusiness jobs in Fuling; Lewis would return to the remote countryside and\nteach. Luke would be married in October, on National Day. It was an\narranged marriage and he had never spent much time with his future wife, but\nhe was a good peasant son who would not oppose his parents’ wishes.\nThe boat pulled out of the harbor. The students stood perfectly still on the\ndock. Behind them the city rose, gray and dirty-looking in the mist. As\nalways on the river I saw Fuling with an outsider’s eyes: it looked big,\nimpersonal, impenetrable. It was hard to believe that for two years this place\nhad been my home. I wondered when I would see it again, and how it would\nbe changed. The boat swung out into the heart of the Yangtze, facing the\ncurrent.\n\nThe river was the same as it always had been. It wasn’t like the people,\nwho had changed so much in my eyes over the course of the two years, and\nwho would now go their own separate and unpredictable ways even as they\nwere frozen in my mind, pinned by memory—making chaoshou, teaching\nclass, standing motionless on the docks. But it was different out on the river,\nwhere my guanxi with the Yangtze had always been simple: sometimes I\nwent with the current, and sometimes I went against it. Upstream it was\nslower and downstream it was faster. That was really all there was to it—we\ncrossed paths, and then we headed off in our own directions.\nAnd finally I stopped worrying about the future or the past, and I simply\nlooked at the city for the last time. The buildings were gray. The mouth of the\nWu was wide with the summer rain. A sampan sculled gracefully near the\nshore. Raise the Flag Mountain was hidden in the mist. Our boat picked up\nspeed and we rushed away against the steady current of the river.\n\nP.S.

My mother teaches history at\nColumbia College. I have three sisters, and all of us attended the local public\nschool, Hickman High School, where I first became interested in literature\nand writing. My sophomore year English teacher, Mary Racine, encouraged\nme to consider a career in writing. Over the next two years, I studied under\ntwo other excellent English teachers, Mary Ann Gates and Khaki Westerfield.\nBy the time I graduated in 1988, I knew that I wanted to become a writer.\n“ I took John McPhee’s seminar in nonfiction writing as a junior,\nwhich helped me realize the possibilities of narrative nonfiction.”\nAt Princeton University I majored in English and Creative Writing. As an\nundergraduate, I focused primarily on writing fiction. I studied under Russell\nBanks, Stuart Dybek, and Joyce Carol Oates. My senior thesis was a\ncollection of short stories set in Missouri.\nAs a junior, I took John McPhee’s seminar in nonfiction writing, which\nhelped me realize the possibilities of narrative nonfiction. The following\nsummer I worked as an ethnographer for the Kellogg Foundation, writing a\nlong ethnographic study about Sikeston, a small town in the southeastern\nMissouri boot heel. The paper was published in Journal for Applied\nAnthropology, and the experience was a valuable introduction to research and\nwriting in a small town.\nI wanted to go overseas after graduation, and as a senior I decided on two\noptions: I applied to join the Peace Corps, and I applied for fellowships to\n\nstudy in England. The Peace Corps planned to send me to Africa, but I pulled\nmy application after receiving a scholarship to Oxford. For two years, I\nstudied English language and literature. After graduating in the summer of\n1994, I went home the wrong way—via the East. For six months I traveled\nfrom Prague to the Gulf of Thailand, all by train and bus and boat. During the\ntrip, I took the Trans-Siberian train to China—my first time in the country.\nThat journey also introduced me to travel writing, and I published stories\nabout my experiences in various American newspapers, including the New\nYork Times and the Philadelphia Inquirer.\nIn 1995, I received a Friends of Switzerland grant, which funded two\nmonths of hiking and writing in the Alps. For most of a year I worked as a\nfreelance writer, publishing travel essays and features. In 1995, I applied\nonce again to the Peace Corps—but this time I requested Asia as my\ndestination. I was thrilled when the Peace Corps sent me back to China.\nWhile teaching in Fuling, I studied Chinese and freelanced the occasional\nstory for American newspapers (including the New York Times and the Los\nAngeles Times). In August of 1998 I returned to Columbia, Missouri, where I\nspent the rest of the year writing about my experiences in Fuling. After\ncompleting a draft of River Town, I tried unsuccessfully to find a job with a\nmajor American newspaper or magazine. Finally, in March of 1999, I\ndecided to return to China independently and try to establish myself as a\nfreelance writer. I settled in Beijing, where I worked part-time for the Wall\nStreet Journal as an assistant (or “clipper”). Most of my time was spent\nfreelancing for a wide range of newspapers and magazines. In 2000, I began\nwriting for National Geographic and The New Yorker. In 2001, I became the\nfirst resident correspondent for The New Yorker to be accredited by the\nPeople’s Republic of China. But I have always remained an independent\nfreelance writer—teaching in the Peace Corps is still the only “real job” that\nI’ve ever had.\n“In March of 1999, I decided to return to China independently and\ntry to establish myself as a freelance writer.”\nI never studied journalism, and some of the less formal aspects of my\n\neducation have been the most productive. I learned more in the Peace Corps\nthan I learned at Oxford, and my summer job as an ethnographer was one of\nthe most valuable writing experiences I had during university. Nowadays, I\ntry to approach narrative nonfiction with the lessons of both literature and the\nsocial sciences. I’m particularly interested in what sociologists call a\n“longitudinal study”—following a subject through time. In China, I’ve often\nkept in touch with individuals over a period of several years, recording how\nthey respond to a fast-changing society.\nSince 1999, I have lived in Beijing, where I have an apartment in a\nhutong. I also keep a home outside of the city in a small village called\nSancha, where I can see the Great Wall from my desk.\n\nAbout the book\nReturn to Fuling\nI WROTE THE FIRST DRAFT of River Town in four months. There wasn’t\nany reason to work so fast; I had no contract or deadline. I could have taken\nmy time, enjoying life in the States after a long absence, but every day I\nstarted writing early and finished late. Memories pushed me to work faster,\nbecause I was afraid that I would lose the immediacy of my time in Fuling.\nAnd I was also motivated by the future: I wanted to record my impressions of\na city that was on the verge of massive change.\n“Memories pushed me to work faster, because I was afraid that I\nwould lose the immediacy of my time in Fuling.”\nThat sense of transformation—constant, relentless, overwhelming change\n—has been the defining characteristic of China during the past two decades.\nIt’s hard to believe that the country used to appear exactly the opposite: the\nChinese were “the people of eternal standstill,” according to Leopold von\nRanke, the nineteenth-century German historian. Nowadays, no description\ncould be less accurate, and one challenge for the writer is that the pen simply\ncan’t keep pace. On the first page of River Town, I wrote\nThere was no railroad in Fuling. It had always been a poor part of\nSichuan province and the roads were bad. To go anywhere, you took the\nboat, but mostly you didn’t go anywhere.\nBy the time the book was published in 2001, a superhighway had been\n\ncompleted to Chongqing, and almost no one took the Yangtze boats to Fuling\nanymore. A railroad line was under construction. The city was booming, its\ngrowth spurred by resettlements from low-lying towns that eventually would\nbe flooded by the Three Gorges Dam. The Huang family, who owned the\nsimple noodle restaurant where I used to eat, had opened an Internet café. My\nstudents had scattered to all corners of the country: to Tibet, to Shanghai, to\nShenzhen, to Wenzhou. But none of this appeared in River Town—the book\nof eternal standstill.\nAfter moving back to China in the spring of 1999, I returned to Fuling at\nleast once a year. The trips were easier than in the old days, because of the\nhighway, and my new life as a writer in Beijing allowed me the freedom to\ntravel. Often, I visited Fuling and then headed downstream along the\nYangtze, into the heart of the Three Gorges.\nDuring my Peace Corps years, the dam had always seemed like an\nabstraction—a vague promise, a distant threat. But every time I returned it\nbecame a little more tangible. By 2002, the resettlements were well\nunderway, and the landscape had become sharply divided between the past\nand the future. Down near the banks, the old river towns and villages were\nleft virtually unimproved. Even though the rest of China was in a\nconstruction frenzy, it was pointless to build anything where the water was\ncertain to rise. These low-lying settlements were allowed to deteriorate, until\neverything looked neglected: broken bricks, dirty tiles, murky streets. The\ndoomed towns contrasted with the new cities, which were being constructed\nof cement and white tile, perched high on the hills above the river. Whenever\nI floated down the Yangtze, I could read the landscape’s evolving history at a\nglance, in a series of horizontal bands: the dark riverside settlements that\nbelonged to the past, the green stretch of farmland that would be claimed by\nthe reservoir, and then, high above, the clusters of white looking toward the\nfuture.\nMy final pre-dam journey was in the fall of 2002. Equipped with a tent\nand sleeping bags, a friend and I set out to hike the old paths that had been\ncarved into the riverside cliffs nearly a century ago. The weather was perfect,\nand the trails were breathtaking; sometimes, they led us high above the\nYangtze, with a hundred-foot drop straight to the water below. With every\nmile I thought: this is the last time I’ll see this trail.\nWe traveled upstream, and we took our time. After spending a week\n\nalong the paths, we visited the riverside settlements that were being\ndemolished. The old city of Wushan had just been torn down, and I wandered\nthrough the rubble, where scavengers gathered anything that could be sold—\nbricks and wire, glass and wood, nails and window frames. One group of men\nwere huddled around a campfire, surrounded by the broken walls of a big\nbuilding, and then I recognized a half-destroyed sign. They were camped in\nthe lobby of the Red Flag Hotel, where I had stayed during my first trip\ndownstream in 1997.\nAll of my favorite river towns were in various stages of destruction.\nDachang was a quarter gone; Peishi was a memory; Daxi was finished.\nSometimes I passed through a village after the scavengers had done their\nwork, and in the silence I studied the things that had been left behind. In\nDaxi, I found a framed photograph of Mount Fuji with a rush of cherry\nblossoms in the foreground. In Qingshi, I hiked past an overstuffed red chair,\nan old basketball rim, and a broken stone tablet whose inscription dated to the\nbeginning of the last century. One house—stripped of roof and windows—\nstill had the front door bolted shut. In Peishi, I purchased mineral water from\na couple whose temporary shack was constructed entirely of scavenged doors\nand window frames. It could have been a Taoist riddle: What does it mean to\nlive in a room made of doors?\nBy the time I reached Fuling the old part of town had been mostly\ndemolished. New developments crowded high on the hilltops, and the city’s\nmassive dike was almost finished. Across the Wu River, the teachers college\nwas also expanding and changing. Old cadres had retired; the new guard was\nmore open to foreigners. Albert, the friendly young man who had first\ngreeted Adam and me upon our arrival, was now the dean of the English\ndepartment. When I visited his office he pulled out the hardback copy of\nRiver Town that I had given the college a year earlier.\n“You can see that a lot of people have read it,” he said. The cover jacket\nwas torn and tea-stained; the corners had been flattened. Fingers had marked\nthe pages a dirty gray. It felt heavy in my hands—an artifact. How could I\nhave written anything that looked so old?\nIn a way, the pace of change seemed to help locals feel comfortable with\nthe book, whose world already seemed faraway. My tutor, Teacher Kong, had\nread it over the course of a summer—word by word, using a dictionary\nbecause he spoke little English. He told me that he had laughed at many\n\nsections that brought back fond memories. During my visit, when I was\nhosted at a local restaurant by college officials, they teased me about my\ndescriptions of past banquets. “We don’t want to make you drink too much!”\none cadre said. “You wrote in your book that we forced you to drink too\nmuch.”\n“It wasn’t a big problem,” I said.\n“We certainly wouldn’t want to do that again!” another cadre said.\nSomebody else chimed in: “Do you want some more baijiu?”\nDuring the days I wandered through the city, looking up old friends. At\nthe bank, I stopped to see Qian Manli, the pretty young woman with whom I\nhad had my only “date” during two years in Fuling. That had been a short\ninterlude: after an hour I discovered that she was married. Now she had a\ntwo-year-old child. She said the same thing that she always said when I\nreturned to Fuling.\n“You don’t recognize me, do you?” she asked. “I’m a lot fatter than\nbefore.”\nI said, “You look exactly the same.”\n“Tell me the truth,” she demanded. “I’m fatter, aren’t I?”\nWhat should an author do when a character gains weight? “You look\ngreat,” I said, and I left it at that.\nWhen the first stage of the dam was completed, and the gates were finally\nclosed, I returned to Wushan. It was June of 2003. In The New Yorker, I\npublished a description of one family’s response to the rising river. They had\nwaited as long as possible, harvesting their vegetables just before the water\narrived:\nJune 7, 2003\nAt six thirteen in the evening, after the Zhou family has already\nmoved their television, a desk, two tables, and five chairs onto a\npumpkin patch beside the road, I prop a brick upright at the river’s\nedge. On new maps for the city of Wushan, this body of water is called\nEmerald Drop Lake. But the maps were printed before the lake\nappeared. In fact, the water is a murky brown, and the lake is actually\n\nan inlet of the Yangtze River, which for the past week has been rising\nbehind the Three Gorges Dam. On Zhou Ji’en’s next trip down from his\nfamily’s bamboo-frame shack, he carries a wooden cupboard on his\nback. A small man, he has a pretty wife and two young daughters, and\nuntil recently they were residents of Longmen Village. The village does\nnot appear on the new maps. A friend of Zhou’s carries the next load,\nwhich includes the family’s battery-powered clock. The clock, like my\nwristwatch, reads nearly six thirty-five. The water has climbed two\ninches up the brick.\nWatching the river rise is like tracking the progress of the clock’s\nshort hand: it’s all but imperceptible. There is no visible current, no\nsound of rushing water—but at the end of every hour another half foot\nhas been gained. The movement seems to come from within, and to some\ndegree it is mysterious to every living thing on the shrinking banks.\nBeetles, ants, and centipedes radiate out in swarms from the river’s\nedge. After the water has surrounded the brick, a cluster of insects crawl\nmadly onto the dry tip, trying desperately to escape as their tiny island\nis consumed.\nFor more than a week, the water rose at the rate of six inches an hour.\nThe details drew me in, until my focus was sharp and the lens narrow: the\nminutes, the seconds, the brick, the insects. When it was all over, and I\nboarded the boat to leave Wushan, the river had become a lake.\nI have not returned since. That wasn’t how I planned it, and I’m not sure why\nI’ve delayed. Perhaps it’s because I wanted to finish my second book, and I\nfeared that a journey to familiar ground would be distracting. Or maybe\nthere’s something about the dam’s finality that saddens me.\nBut I recognize the risks of foreign nostalgia, especially in a place once\nknown as home to “the people of eternal standstill.” If it’s sad to watch a\nlandscape be transformed beyond recognition, it’s even sadder to spend time\nin a place that doesn’t change. One of my former students, William Jefferson\nFoster, left his remote hometown after graduation. Like more than one\n\nhundred million rural Chinese across the nation, he became a migrant. He\ntraveled to the boomtowns of the eastern coast, where he found success as an\nEnglish teacher in a private school. One year, after visiting his parents during\na vacation, he wrote me a letter about his hometown. Nearly everybody of\nWilly’s generation had left, and the village seemed to be dying:\nWhen I am home, nothing has changed and the roads are still rough\nand people are getting older. It makes me sad that I can not find familiar\npeople or friends who I knew well when I was young.\nFor most Chinese, that’s the alternative to constant change: poverty and\nbad roads and slow boats. As a foreigner who learned to love Fuling during\nthe period from 1996 to 1998, I’m grateful that I had the opportunity to\nrecord those years, and I miss the places I knew. But I’m also grateful that\nmost people in the city are optimistic about the future. I’ll be back soon, and I\nlook forward to the journey. It will feel good to be on the Yangtze again,\neven if the swift current of the old river is nothing but a memory.\nBeijing, October 2005\n\nRead on\nAuthor’s Picks\nBooks About China\n“In my opinion this is the best history book about the Yangtze.”\nSOUL MOUNTAIN by Gao Xingjian\nHe’s the only Chinese writer to have won the Nobel Prize, and this is his best\nbook. It reflects the period in the 1980s when reforms first started to take\nhold and Chinese like Gao began to travel and gain a new sense of their\ncountry.\nRED DUST by Ma Jian\nLike Gao’s book, Red Dust describes the travels of an artistic young man\nduring the 1980s. But Ma Jian’s book is nonfiction and he gives a fascinating\nglimpse of society during that period—for example, the cross-country\ncontacts of the intelligentsia, who protected and supported each other. Many\nparts of the book are also quite funny.\nYANGTZE: NATURE, HISTORY, AND THE RIVER by\nLyman P. Van Slyke\nIn my opinion this is the best history book about the Yangtze. It’s not\nweighed down by a need to be relentlessly comprehensive or authoritative;\nYangtze feels like the work of a historian who simply loves the texture of the\nriver’s past.\n\nA SINGLE PEBBLE by John Hersey\nIn Hersey’s novel, the Yangtze world is romanticized and dramatized—his\ntrackers’ paths, for example, are a lot more treacherous than the actual\ncliffside routes that were used by many travelers. But the book is well written\nand gives a powerful sense of the early dream of the Yangtze dam. In A\nSingle Pebble, the foreigners are the ones pushing the idea; by the time the\ndam was actually built, foreigners had become its loudest critics.\nWAR TRASH by Ha Jin\nThis novel describes a Chinese soldier’s experience in the Korean War (in\nChinese it’s known as “the War to Resist America and Aid Korea”). This\nperspective is rare in both the United States and in China, where histories\ngloss over the ways in which this conflict damaged so many Chinese lives.\n1587: A YEAR OF NO SIGNIFICANCE by Ray Huang\nThis history book’s subtitle is “The Ming Dynasty in Decline,” and it\ndescribes in wonderful detail a ruler who is losing his grip on the empire.\nSome aspects of this book—the weight of bureaucracy, for example—are still\nrecognizable to anybody who lives in China. Chinese histories can be so\noverwhelming, and I find this book valuable because its narrow focus\nactually allows for a broader scope: a powerful sense of time, authority, and\nempire.\nGOD’S CHINESE SON: THE TAIPING HEAVENLY\nKINGDOM OF HONG XIUQUAN by Jonathan D. Spence\nI like many of Spence’s books and this is probably my favorite. It describes a\nbizarre moment in Chinese history, when an obscure aspirant to the civil\nservice suffered a breakdown and, in a series of visions, came to believe that\nhe was Jesus’s Chinese brother. He gained thousands of followers, as well as\nmilitary control over much of China’s southeast before the rebellion was\nfinally put down. The story shows how foreign ideas sometimes retain their\npower but become warped when they move between cultures.\nSIX RECORDS OF A FLOATING LIFE by Shen Fu\n\nThis is a small, quiet book—the reflections of an obscure government clerk\nwho was born at the end of the eighteenth century. Unlike most records from\nthat period (or any period in Chinese history, for that matter), this book is\nintensely personal. Shen Fu describes his love for his wife as well as his\nrelations with various courtesans. It’s a rare book, and it makes the reader\nrealize how many details of everyday life weren’t recorded or preserved in a\nculture whose literary tradition tended to be quite formal.\nRED AZALEA by Anchee Min\nThere’s something mesmerizing about this book, which covers a devastating\nperiod in short sentences, one after another, until the Cultural Revolution is\nbroken down into a train of impressions and emotions and visions of\nbrutality. That’s how an anti-individual political campaign appears to\nsomebody who is fiercely individual.\nWILD GRASS by Ian Johnson\nThis is an excellent book for anybody who is writing about contemporary\nChina. Johnson gives a sense of his working methods without dominating the\nstory, and his portraits of individual Chinese are moving. In particular his\nsection on Falun Gong is an example of narrative nonfiction at its best.\nCOMING HOME CRAZY by Bill Holm;\nIRON AND SILK by Mark Salzman\nThese are extremely different books, and people who live in China tend to\nhave strong reactions to them, both positive and negative. I list them together\nbecause they are both about teaching English in China, and also because they\nweighed on me when I wrote River Town. I knew that I wanted to write\nsomething different. But back when I lived in Fuling, and the pressures of\nwriting were the last thing on my mind, I thoroughly enjoyed both of these\nbooks. They reminded me that the experience of teaching in China had been\nshared by many, but also that each teacher had his own story.\n\nRead an Excerpt from Peter Hessler’s Oracle Bones\nOracle Bones tells the story of modern-day China and its growing links to the\nWestern world, as seen through the lives of a handful of ordinary people who\nare connected in one way or another to America. In addition to the author,\nhimself an American living as a journalist in Beijing, the narrative tracks\nPolat, a trader and member of a forgotten ethnic minority, who moves to\nWashington, D.C.; William Jefferson Foster, who grew up in a remote village\nwhere most residents were illiterate; Emily, a migrant factory worker in a\ncity without a past; and Chen Mengjia, a scholar of mysterious ancient\nartifacts known as oracle bones, and a man whose story has slipped into\nobscurity since his suicide in the 1960s. All of them are migrants, emigrants,\nor wanderers who find themselves far from home, their lives dramatically\nchanged by historical forces they are struggling to understand. Oracle Bones\nis now available in hardcover from HarperCollins Publishers.\n\nASYLUM\nJanuary 2001\nWASHINGTON, D.C., like Beijing, is a deliberate capital. Both cities are\nsquare: straight streets, right angles. They are arranged strictly according to\nthe compass, and each occupies a site that represented, in the eyes of a\nvisionary ruler, a blank slate. The Ming emperor Yongle selected his location\non the northern plain; George Washington chose the bend of the Potomac\nRiver. And each city’s layout—the grid of monuments and broad streets—\nimmediately tells a visitor that this is a seat of authority.\nAt the heart of each capital stands a political structure. In Beijing, the\nForbidden City represents the center; in Washington, D.C., everything\nemanates from the domed building of the United States Capitol. From that\npoint, the street names follow a strict logic, a testimony to American\npragmatism: roads that run north and south are numbered; letters of the\nalphabet mark the east-west streets. Heading due north from the domed\nbuilding, along North Capitol Street, one crosses the latter part of the\nalphabet—Q Street, R Street, S Street—before the intersection of Rhode\nIsland Avenue. Rhode Island continues northeast (U, V, W) and then, after\nthe first alphabet is exhausted, it begins anew with two-syllable names:\nAdams, Bryant, Channing. Douglas for D, Evarts for E, Franklin for F. On\nthe corner of Franklin and Rhode Island is a dilapidated beige-brick\napartment building. Inside that building, in an apartment on the third floor,\nfive Uighurs found a temporary home in the fall of 2000.\nFor months, the apartment had served as a way station for recent arrivals\nfrom China. The rent was only four hundred dollars a month, and tenancy\nwas passed from Uighur to Uighur. The apartment consisted of a small\nkitchen, two bedrooms, and a living room where a pair of mattresses had\nbeen laid out on the floor. One wall of the living room was decorated with\nframed verses from the Koran; across the room, on another wall, hung a\nmulticolored map of the United States.\nNone of the current residents planned to stay in the apartment for long.\nOne man had recently crossed illegally from Canada; another had already\nreceived political asylum and was applying for permanent resident status; the\n\nothers were preparing asylum applications. Each man found his own path\nthrough the city, acquiring jobs, lawyers, necessary documents. Along the\nway, they explored holes in the system. That was another link between\nWashington, D.C., and Beijing: beneath the grid of straight streets and\nimpressive monuments, there was always an element of disorder.\nShortly after Polat moved into the apartment, he read the classified\nsection of a Chinese-language newspaper and noticed an advertisement for\n“driver’s license consulting.” The service was based in the District’s\nChinatown, and for $150, the consultants offered to provide the paperwork\nfor a Virginia driver’s license. Among the immigrant community, Virginia\nwas known for its loophole: applicants for driver’s licenses and state identity\ncards didn’t have to show proof of residence or even identity. The only\nrequirement was a notarized affidavit testifying that the applicant lived in\nVirginia and had valid documents. It was possible for an out-of-state, illegal\nimmigrant—in other words, somebody like Polat—to acquire a Virginia\ndriver’s license without ever showing his passport to a government official.\nNon-English speakers were also allowed to bring their own translators to the\nexamination.\nThe Chinatown service arranged Polat’s affidavit, no questions asked,\nand they sent a Chinese man to accompany him during the written exam.\nWhenever the Chinese man came to the correct answer of a multiple-choice\nquestion, he muttered, Da ge, which means “big brother.” Big brother, big\nbrother, big brother. Polat passed with flying colors. After receiving his\nlicense, he bought a silver 1992 Honda Accord for thirty-one hundred dollars.\nOne evening that winter, Polat tried to call his mother in Xinjiang, but the\napartment’s phone service was cut off. He decided to use the public telephone\nnear the corner of Rhode Island and Franklin. It was almost midnight. The\npay phone was right across the street from the Good Ole Reliable Liquor\nStore.\nWhile he was punching the numbers, a man came up from behind and\nsaid something that Polat didn’t understand. He ignored the man and kept\ndialing Xinjiang. Before Polat could finish, he felt something pressed against\nhis back. He whirled around and saw that the object was a handgun.\nTwo men: one with the gun, one in a car. “Lay down,” said the gunman,\nand this time Polat understood. He dropped down; the gunman searched him.\nHe found seventy dollars in a front pocket but somehow missed the three\n\nhundred that Polat had stashed in another pocket. The two muggers drove\naway on Rhode Island Avenue. Polat picked himself up and hurried back to\nthe apartment. He had been outside for less than five minutes.\nTHAT WINTER, I visited the United States for a month. I spent Christmas\nwith my parents and sisters in Missouri, and I saw friends and editors in\nvarious cities: Los Angeles, San Francisco, New York, and Washington, D.C.\nNone of these places felt truly familiar. I had grown up in one American\nsmall town and attended college in another; since graduation I had lived\noverseas. There wasn’t a single big city in America that I could negotiate\nwithout a map.\nTo me, the capital felt the most foreign. The layout was intimidating;\nthere never seemed to be enough people to fill the District. In January, the\nmonuments looked particularly deserted: empty paths, yellowed grass. The\nsky was the color of cold metal; the forecast called for snow. I took the metro\nto Rhode Island Avenue, surrounded by unfamiliar faces. The first person I\nrecognized was a Uighur.\nHe had waited outside the station, on foot—his Honda was in the shop.\nWe grinned and shook hands, just like the old days in Yabaolu. His face\nlooked thinner; he had lost weight since coming to America. He still chain-\nsmoked, but now he bought Marlboro Lights instead of Hilton. Back in\nBeijing, he had preferred Marlboro but usually didn’t buy them, because of\nall the fakes.\nWe walked to his apartment, and he laughed when I took off my coat.\n“Your shirt’s the same as mine,” he said.\nI looked down and realized that we had dressed identically: olive green\nCaterpillar-brand denim shirts.\n“Did you buy that in Yabaolu?” he asked.\n“Yes. In that new market in Chaoyangmenwai.”\n“It’s jiade,” he said, laughing. “Fake. Same as mine. How much did you\npay?”\nThat was a question that had no good answer in China; the moment\nanybody asked, you knew you had gotten ripped off.\n“Maybe seventy yuan,” I said, hopelessly.\n\n“I paid forty,” Polat said. “They probably charged you more because\nyou’re a foreigner.”\nDon’t miss the next book by your favorite author.

I owe a great deal to all the Hesslers and Gundys who kept in touch\nduring my two years in Sichuan, and thanks for your encouragement and\nsupport while I was writing. I promise that someday I’ll find subjects closer\nto home.\nFrom the first trip downriver to the final revision of the manuscript,\nAdam Meier has been everything I could ask of a friend. In particular, thanks\nfor being such a steadying influence in Fuling, and thanks for all your help\nwith the editing—at times, a difficult and delicate process. We’ve tilted at our\nshare of windmills together and not for a moment would I have rather been\nthere with anybody else.\nI was also fortunate to share the joys and challenges of Fuling life with\nSunni Fass and Noreen Finnegan, who were great sitemates. I couldn’t have\nstarted my time in Sichuan with a better group than Peace Corps China 3:\nTamy Chapman, Sean Coady, Mike Goettig, Rose Karkoski, Karen Lauck,\nLisa McCallum, Rob Schmitz, Craig Simons, Sarah Telford, Rebecca Steinle\nWallihan, Andrew and Molly Watkins, and Adam Weiss. I also want to thank\nTravis Klingberg, Christopher Marquardt, Mike Meyer, and the Wolken\nfamily for their friendship, both in Sichuan and afterwards.\nThe Peace Corps China staff provided me with a perfect combination of\nsupport and freedom while I was in Fuling, especially Dr. William Speidel,\nKandice Christian, Don McKay, and Zhan Yimei.\nA number of editors helped me with revisions. In particular, I was\nfortunate to work with Doug Hunt of the University of Missouri, who was\nalways generous with his time and good advice. I appreciated the comments\nand recommendations of Scott Kramer, Matt Metzger, Angela Hessler,\nTerzah Ewing of the Wall Street Journal, and Ian Johnson of the Wall Street\n\nJournal’s Beijing bureau. I benefited from the recommendations of a former\nFuling student who read the manuscript and gave me a local’s reaction—I\nwon’t name you here, but I very much appreciate your help. And I want to\nthank John McPhee of Princeton University for both guidance and friendship;\nyour encouragement while I was living in Fuling helped get this book started.\nThanks to Tim Duggan, my editor at HarperCollins, and William Clark,\nmy agent, for your enthusiasm and support for this project.\nMy largest debt of gratitude is to my friends in Fuling. I hope that my\nstories reflect your generosity, patience, and understanding. In particular I\nwant to thank my former students, who are now working all across China,\nfrom the highlands of Tibet to southern boom towns like Shenzhen. Most of\nyou are now teachers, and many of you are living in your own Sichuanese\nriver towns, along the Yangtze, the Wu, the Longxi, the Changtou, the Meixi,\nthe Yancang, the Quxi, the Daxi—all of the small and remote rivers that run\nthrough eastern Sichuan, where the schools are simple and the classes\ncrowded but the teachers do the best they can. I hope that you are blessed\nwith students as wonderful as mine.\n\nCredits\nMap Design by Annie Lee\n\nPraise for\n\nRIVER TOWN\nby PETER HESSLER\n“A perceptive and engrossing account of an outsider in fast-changing\nChina….
